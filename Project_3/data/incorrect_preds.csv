18,1,0,Opinions On Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them AND Fantastic Beasts Crimes Of Grindelwald? Some people are saying Fantastic Beasts were good but not Crimes Of Grindelwald blah blah blah. I personally like both but I enjoy Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them More. Also as a proud Hufflepuff I'm very happy that we have THE main character be a Hufflepuff.

I thought it'd be cool to package the gift inspired by fantastic beasts (I initially wanted to throw a Niffler in the mix, but after Christmas no place near me has them in stock and I'm throwing things together quickly. Anyways, I still thought the roaring 20s and phohibition time would fit the alcoholic theme)  I'll be wrapping the bottle in self-printed magical newspapers and still need a quote (or something) to go on the cover of the birthday card. I just can't think of any good ones and thought I'd use the hive brain instead.  So... help me out, please?"

204,1,0,"Fantastic Beast: Crime of Grindelwald - Queenie's character So, I had an argument with my brother the other day about Queenie.   We saw her in the first movie and adore her. She was lovely, fell in love with Jacob and was all on board about the relationship between muggles and wizards.   In the second movie we saw her more disturbed, tryin to ""force"" the ralationship with Jacob (just because he doesn't wanted the posibilitys of her being arrested), and in the end she followed Grindelwald for the ""good"" of the love between them (Jacob and Queenie) and to mix both worlds.   So the argument was because my brother think that the character was showed as a stupid little girl who was heartbroken, forgot to use her legeremancy and played really dumb in every scene (i.e.: the one when she met Grindelwand in the house, and the other when she jus run thrugh Paris and go crazy). And he think that the directors destroyed a great character for nothing and he hate her now.   I, on the other hand, think that the character was so human and demostrate that everyone had a breakdown that leads us to make the most weird and crazy things for love or just act out of our mind. And at the end I want to know what will happend now that she choose a side. She demostrate that Grindelwald has a incredible good  speaker and that he knew how to win people over.   So, now I wanna know what do you think about Queenie."

Who are you hoping to come across in this game? Nicolas Flamel, perhaps?  What pivotal events would you like to see portrayed or alluded to in the game?

575,1,0,"FANTASTIC BEASTS 2: Can the Blood Pact be undone? So, I'm going to share with you some of the ideas I had in between the two Grindewald Crime sessions I checked out. *One of the few interesting mega elements in Fantastic Animals - The Grindelwald Crimes is the mysterious Blood Pact that the mega villain carries with them. Pact in which the two swore - never - to fight against each other.                                              Except that from the perspective of the Perpetual Vow, it is more than possible that either one of you breaks the Pact of Blood something happens to you both. After all, starting from the idea that Dumbledore and Grindelwald will face each other, then the Pact will be broken. The X-point of all this is HOW this Covenant will be broken.*  **So will the Blood Pact be broken in Fantastic Beasts 3 ?!**  **Yeah. I had this idea starting from the following idea: Among the various bridges that Fantastic Beasts 2 made with Fantastic Beasts 3, two of them highly important, are: Credence is actually Aurelio Dumbledore, brother of Dumbledore, and O Blood Pact needs to be undone.**  **Thus, I am coming to the conclusion that the focus of Fantastic Beasts 3 will be precisely the complete journey to undo this pact. And even more, it is likely that the way it can be broken will be found in the country that will be used as the setting for Fantastic Beasts 3.**  *So, starting from the idea that The Crimes of Grindelwald was a hunt for the various Ministries of Magic of the world by Grindelwald, he may now become the hunter. After all, if the pact is broken - I assume that there may be consequences for the two who did it, just like the Perpetual Vow - Grindelwald is at a disadvantage because several can kill the villain (including the quartet: Newt, Theseus , Queenie and Tina, even Queenie having passed the Black Side of the Force), but only Credence will be strong enough to kill Dumbledore.*  *That is, it will not be easy to break the Pact of Blood, but when it comes to being broken, the consequences will not be so advantageous for Grindelwald. But taking into account that this will be in the third movie, it is likely that he will turn the table in the room and in the fifth everyone will be fighting on an equal basis. = D*"

668,1,0,"My Expectations for Fantastic Beasts 3 So, we found out today that Fantastic Beasts 3 will come out....on November 12, 2021. This is my personal take on the news:  If we’re going to have to wait 3 years in between movies, especially after the disaster that was The Crimes of Grindelwald, then FB3 better be spectacular. Not just good, not even great, it damn better be the best movie made of the entire HP franchise.   Stop trying to give us lame fan service like you did with McGonagall last movie and actually give us a story with explanations and action that we can enjoy as a stand-alone story, but also one that works as part of a series."
674,0,1,Just watched it for a second time in the cinema I loved the music so much. It gave me chills. I love the characters and I loved the story. Totally worth going in a second time because I picked up even more details. Can't wait for the third one!
789,1,0,"My Theory/predictions about Queenie's fate in future FB films My theory/hope for Queenie's fate in future films is for her to have an arch similar to Edmund Pevensie in ""The Lion, The Witch &  The Wardrobe"". A family member and close ally of the main protagonists seduced to join/support the enemy and eventually realizes they've made a mistake and rejoins the heros.  Here's how I see things playing out:  **FB 3:**   Throughout this film Queenie will struggle with the choice she's made, and eventually realize she's chosen the wrong side. Perhaps some of the things she is expected to do for the cause become too much her. She will then attempt to rejoin the main gang either at the end of this film or (more likely in my opinion) the start/middle of the next film  **FB 4:**   Queenie is attempting to rejoin the heros again, however they are obviously distrustfull of her. Maybe she tries to stall for time to work against Grindelwald from the inside for a while and when the heros find out, this is what makes them slowly start to trust her again. Regardless, Queenie has towards this films end completely left Grindelwald's side to rejoin the heros. Depending on the the severity of actions she may or may not have commited in Grindelwald's name, the authorites may want her locked up, or maybe even executed, thus having the film end with Queenie imprisoned or on the run, but secretly working with the some members of themain group, who may not completely trust her yet, but are at least willing to give her a chance at redemption.  **FB 5:**   If Queenie was on the run at the end of the last film, she will still be at the start of this one. If Queenie was imprisoned at the end of the last film, events will transpire to get her out at least before the end of the first act. She will then proceed as if she had just been on the run.   Queenie spends this film secretly working with the main gang, slowly gaining back their trust and rekindeling her relationship with Jacob. She then massively helps somehow with whatever final events take place. At the very end however, I see four possible outcomes:   &gt; **1**: She dies in a ""Death equals redemtion"" kinda way, leaving Jacob hearbroken.    &gt; **2**: She lives and is either given a ligher sentence for helping bring down Grindelwald. Perhaps been banned from performing magic, a short time in jail, or whatever. Or, she is pardoned outright. Eitherway, this ending sees her getting together with Jacob, and they can finally get married legally and happy ending and all that, YAY!   &gt; **3**: Same as ending 2, she is pardoned or given a lighter punishment, but Jacob dies, leaving Queenie heartbroken.   &gt; **4**: Both Jacob &  Queenie die, leaving Newt and Tina sad over the loss of their best friend and sister respectively.  Personally I believe ending 1 or 4 are the most likely outcome given Rowling's track record, but since I'm such a sucker for sentimental solutions, I'm really hoping for ending 2, as unlikely as it is. Jacob and Queenie were just too precious in the first film to waste. I'm still rooting for these two, and hoping that Rowling is not gonna go on a final-installment-killing-spree again.  Those are my predictions at least. Agree/disagree? What are your thoughts? I'll end this by saying that despite the popular opinion, I LOVED Crimes of Grindelwald, and don't mind any of the more upsetting twists and turns. I just think that makes it more fun to look forward to and speculate/theorize about future installments, as is clear from this post I should think."

890,1,0,"Theory: How to Cure an Obscurial Basically, to cure an Obscurial, the excess magic built up in the form of an Obscurus must be drained. Have the Obscurial shoot a lot of really powerful random spells at a dummy. When magic energy is expelled from the wand, energy from the Obscurus will be exumed, making the color of the sparks from the wand black. Repeat intensively. As the Obscurus loses energy the sparks will turn lighter, to grey and then, the spells cast will have the color they usually have, green, blue, red, whatever. When no traces of the Obscurus is seen in the sparks from the wand, the Obscurial is cured. Scarring on chest or abdomen from the damage of the Obscurus is possible."

I've come to a feeling that this movie cares more about ""details about the wizard world"" stuff than to tell a good story."

1362,1,0,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - Aurelius Edition. Presenting an alternate fan cut of the movie I've been working on for months!  Crimes of Grindelwald suffers from a myriad of issues that could be solved by editing in some finer details and scenes to make the plot much more cohesive and give characters like Credence who are central to the story an actual presence in the plot and pace it much better.  My cut of the movie aims to do just that. Credence is given the focus he deserves, entire scenes have been recut and restructured and new footage from Behind The Scenes and Deleted Scenes has been reinserted into the movie to make it flow much better and make sense.  If you've already seen the original movie many times, you will notice that a lot of the scenes in my version have been restructured by taking them out of context to construct entirely new scenes. Some footage from the first Fantastic Beasts like dialogue has been reused to make character decisions make sense.  A brief summary of changes :  1. CREDENCE IS NOW CENTRAL TO THE PLOT INSTEAD OF BEING RELEGATED TO A MERE PLOT DEVICE. 2. QUEENIE IS CALLED OUT FOR BASICALLY ""DATE RAPING"" JACOB AND A GLIMPSE OF THE PARIS GARDEN SCENE HAS BEEN ADDED TO MAKE QUEENIE'S DECISION TO DEFECT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE. 3. THE ROMANTIC THRILLER TAG IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN MY CUT AND IS EMPHASIZED FREQUENTLY. 4. MOST DELETED SCENES HAVE BEEN ADDED BACK IN A WAY THAT FEELS TRULY NATURAL. 5. THERE IS ALSO A BUNCH OF NEW FOOTAGE ALONG WITH THE DELETED SCENES. 6. EXPOSITION DUMPS HAVE BEEN FULLY MINIMIZED. 7. A MID-CREDIT SCENE HAS BEEN ADDED THAT WILL SHOCK YOU GUYS.  A couple glitches are present in this cut but nothing too major, stuff like an establishing shot reading ""Paris, France"" because I needed an establishing shot and didn't have any.  Here is a link to the movie (PLEASE WATCH ONLY IF YOU LEGALLY OWN THE MOVIE ON BLU RAY) :  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vRvnAN\_OV3dk5ut4d9Ot5JRhHxizNY1v](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vRvnAN_OV3dk5ut4d9Ot5JRhHxizNY1v)  Here is a document with a log of changes I have made to the film:  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qHFEeXT6Zwak9ZC9h1dLjU03IDTEQ4Fl](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qHFEeXT6Zwak9ZC9h1dLjU03IDTEQ4Fl)"

1429,1,0,"Dumbledore's greatest desire isn't Grindelwald As we know, the books and the movies are kept conservative when it comes to Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship. Seeing Grindelwald on the Mirror of Erised is probably the most confirmation we'll ever see in the actual movies.   Anyway, my theory is that Dumbledore's greatest desire is the vial containing the blood oath.   The whole Erised sequence showed the creation of the blood oath and then Grindelwald, who *wears* the vial. So I think Dumbledore's greatest desire is to get that vial so that he can finally fight Grindelwald.   Dumbledore most likely still has love for Grindelwald, but I think getting to hung up on his ex is a little bit immature. He's a different person now from the person who was blindly head over heels with Grindelwald and he probably understands that he needs to destroy him."

1608,1,0,Tom Riddle Nature vs Nurture I’m sure this was brought up a lot. Maybe if Voldemort’s mom was alive and nurtured him he’d probably be different. I honestly think his mom would probably have resented him for looking just like his father who rejected her.   But was he really mistreated at the orphanage? He hurt his peers and animals and stole from them. The orphanage seemed to be doing all they can just like Dumbledore did all he could. Tom literally had no capacity for love or emotion. He didn’t seem to be a child who was acting out for attention because if someone gave it to him he would use it to his advantage which was exactly what he did at Hogwarts. I personally think he was a lost cause who was conceived from an evil act and was evil all along.

Hi everyone,  I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on a certain movie companion or book to read to better understand the Fantastic Beasts movies. I absolutely adore the Harry Potter books and I enjoyed the movies, but I found I really needed to read the books a few times to have a great appreciation for the movies. I tried watching the first Fantastic Beasts movie but stopped about 20-30 mins into it because I felt a little confused.   I know there is a book out there that’s more of the script, but from a quick search of this subreddit, I discovered that people said it wasn’t helpful in understanding the movie?   Just hoping someone can point me in the right direction... I really want access to as much of the HP universe as I can, but I find without a book to lay a foundation, the HP movies can be confusing to follow.   Thank you to any and all recommendations :)"

Upon further research of this house I realize how much of a hufflepuff I am inside.   Compassion kindness loyalty inclusiveness. It's those virtues above all the other ones that make a hufflepuff.

Girl a said; well i never saw the first one. Girl b; yeah but did you like the first one. A; sure. But when that old guy said a name..dumble something..b; dumbledore? A; yeah! Dumbledore. The whole audience reacted. Why, whats the fuzz?  So that girl never saw or read anything harry potter related.  I also went to the harry potter exposition last year. When i waited in line there i overheard another girl saying; whats a weasley.  Its not that i hate the people that dont like or are that intrested in harry potter.

2182,1,0,"So... about Nagini. This post was originally going to be how I loved Nagini being in the Crimes of Grindelwald and thought that we were getting a lot of story from a major character in the HP series that we knew pretty much nothing about. My one problem though was how did someone who is painted as such a good character in THIS movie end up siding with freaking VOLDEMORT! I mean with Grindelwald taking Credence from her I would think another dark lord with a similar goal would have her only too ready to tear Voldy another set of nostrils... And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. One thing credence and Voldemort have in common is they are both orphans that never got to know their parents. However credence’s story ends, perhaps Nagini will feel as though she has failed him. Maybe he dies? Maybe Credence gets locked up forever? Whatever the case credences story won’t end happily ever after and Nagini is going to blame herself. Here comes Tom Riddle, her second chance. Here comes the only person left in the world who can commune with her, and so it’s only natural she will feel some sort of responsibility to see that his dreams become a reality. What I originally wrote off as a lazy retcon might actually be some of the deepest lore bits in the HP universe. I just hope that I’m right and that this isn’t just a big oversight. I mean the way things are right now I feel really bad for Nagini and really want things to end happily for her... Knowing what we know from HP they won’t."

2286,1,0,"Do you think that the focus of fantastic beasts should be Dumbledore (and Grindelwald), rather than newt scamander? Crimes of Grindelwald has been criticized and scrutinized into Oblivion, and all the many reasons for it have been stated a million times over. The biggest and most understandable reason for such is how poorly put together and jumbled the plot (or should I say 10 different sub plots within the plot) is.  Fantastic beasts felt like a nice intro to the story, despite feeling a bit empty... And a large portion of it simply being about newt wandering around NYC looking for his pets...  Many fans are questioning if the series should even come tinue at all and popular potterhead YouTuber Seamus Gorman recently made a video discussing this.   I honestly feel like this series has the potential to be incredible , but the second film was very poorly executed. This is not a story about children at a school... This has the potential to be a very dark and adult story about two men who loved each other deply but were torn apart by their conflicting ambitions and political views.   Is having newt scamander the center of the story the right way to go about it, or should Dumbledore (and Grindelwald) be the center of the story?   Do you even care at this point (I ask this because so many fans seem to be jumping ship and ignoring FB and everything post DH altogether)."

He's a fantastic actor, from the same area as Grindelwald, and could play the suave, manipulating Grindelwald from the books really well. I'm not sold on how they made Grindelwald look on the FB series... it just looks like a generic Johnny Depp character from any of his other movies, and they made him look weird just for the sake of it and so we have a clear idea of who the bad guy is supposed to be."
2392,0,1,"Thoughts Thought: Remember back in the Harry Potter series where Dumbledore goes to the orphanage to meet young Tom Riddle. All wizards and witches must have had to be taken account off and brought into schools to be taught magic to avoid becoming a obscure and that's they are given letter, or in this case dumbledore goes and gets Tom in person.  Secondly,  imagine if he had been left in the orphanage and how strong of an obscure he would have become  Thirdly ... I guess this links up to why when Harry asks Dumbledore what he would have done if he knew that the boy Tom would grow up to be the most evil wizard of all time, he would probably have had to kill him, because he couldn't just leave young Tom  And finally, I guess Harry would have become and obscure too because his family punished him for being magical and were trying to suppress him... luckily he was the chosen one and Hagrid had to save him anyways"

2521,1,0,"I finally sat down and watched ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" and I have mixed feelings about it that I really wanted to share (spoilers inside ofc) So I want to get the negative stuff out of the way first, and then I'll get to the good stuff, cause I'd like to end this with a positive note :) (also I'm on mobile and English is not my first language, please do point out any mistake you find)  TLDR at the bottom, cause it's a longer post than expected.   Costumes This was honestly the most annoyng part of the movie for me, I could understand them in the first movie since our beloved hufflepuff was trying to blend in with muggles, and maybe American wizards just dress normally, who knows. But I just could not buy them in this movie, Albus Dumbledore dressing like a muggle? Muggles-hating purebloods dressing like muggles? FRENCH WIZARDS DRESSING LIKE MUDBLOODS? LESTRANGE WIZARDS DRESSING LIKE MUDBLOODS? it was honestly the most distracting and annoying part of the movie for me.  Nagini Why was this necessary? Maledictus are a cool concept: I like cruel inevitability in a character's destiny, but WHY NAGINI? Just give her another name she seems like a character that could be interesting if well done, but knowing she is the hateful snake that killed the riddle's mansion gardener and killed Snape AND served Voldemort just makes her automatically uninteresting for me. Also she seems to hate purebloods but then she is fine being by voldemort's side? Does she loses her humanity when becoming a snake?  Credence DUMBLEDORE'S BROTHER? REALLY? WHY? The idea of him just being some powerful mage who could've been born out of a muggle family could have been so fascinating! The fate of the entire magical world decided by the son of a muggle family? Such a powerful idea! But no, he's part of one of the most famous wizard family in the world. :(  The whole boat ordeal Ok, this is just a gigantic plothole. First of all the lestrange family, with branches all over Europe, and has houses and power all over the continent decide that most secure place for a full pureblood wizard is America with an HALFELF HYBRID, because of ONE boy who wants to kill him? Wtf? Literally just gang up on the guy, kill him before he even finds out where you live, cast a fidelius spell on your hideout, put out a reward for his head! So many different things could have been done and sending him away from their influence with an hybrid being definitely sounds stupid. Then ON THE SAME BOAT there's a secret dumbledore heir which, by logic, is a fourth son of dumbledore's father, he seems to be much younger than dumbledore, maybe 6-7 years? Wasn't dumbledore's father AT AZKABAN AT THAT POINT? and even if he wasn't, we know he loved his family over any doubt, he literally gave up on his life over the anger he felt for what the muggle kids had done to Ariana, but he had a secret affair with someone and sent them to America BY BOAT? why not ANY OTHER MAGICAL MEANS? This whole thing is so forced it completely ruined the twist that Tina was the one responsible for her brother death.  Fawkes So let's just strip away one of the coolest thing that dumbledore had going for himself, being worthy of a fucking phoenix and let's just say it's a family heirloom, sure.  Such a genious move.  Congrats, I hate it.   Hogwarts How can you make hogwarts look... Boring? Maybe that's not the right word, but the place just looks so... Not magical. It looked so.... Plain, how do you even manage to do that? I grew up with the books and the movies, and hogwarts always had this strange and whimsical aura, but in this movie? It just looks like a normal, boring school.   Let's talk about positives now   Queenie I LOVED her arc in this movie. She just wants to love whoever she wants, she just wants to be free, and Grindelwald ideas are so appealing to her from the get go. She is obviously used to emphasise how manipulative Grindelwald really is, and how absurdly suffocating the rules of the magical world must be for someone like Queenie. I think she may very well become an ""anti-snape"" type of character, turning evil because of love, instead of turning good,but I am really afraid that they're going to fuck this up and just make her redeem herself, which, in my opinion, would be the most boring ending to her arc.  Tina She is a really interesting character, she is a Slytherin but not an evil person, granted she murdered her own baby brother but then she just sacrifices herself to save newt's brother (I can't remember his name sorry, so many characters in this movie!) , in the end they leave us with the doubt that her final ""I love you"" was directed to Newt, and I hate that, but generally her character left a good impression on me.  Newt I think he's great honestly, I have a soft spot for these kind of quirky/weird characters, absolutely loved his interactions with his brother, but I don't think he got too much character development in this movie except for the ""I picked a side"" thing, which I don't think makes much sense, he obviously is against grindelwald ideas from the start of the movie.  Nicholas flamel Loved him tbh, I was so happy he was being introduced as a character, and the idea that his immortality is not eternal youth got me laughing a bit. He does prove to be a really powerful wizard by the end of the movie, and I hope he'll be important in future plots as well.  Jude law as Dumbledore His acting was on point I think, thay just didn't give him much to work with, but I liked most scenes with him, although he doesn't seem to age at all between newt's generation and the present of the movie, which was a bit weird to me.  Grindelwald I liked him. He probably had the only remotely ""wizard-like"" costume, he came off as ruthless and manipulative and incredibly powerful. Am I the only one who thought the eye make-up was weird? It was super distracting for me during the scenes he was in.  Fantastic beasts. I mostly enjoied the CG (except the familiars in the ministry they looked remarkably fake) and most of the creatures looked interesting, even though they were not a big focus in the movie. The big cat thingy was cute :)  I think that's all, that came out longer than I expected, thank you if you read all of that :D  TLDR: Bad things: costumes, nagini, credence, FUCKING BOAT TRAVEL, fawkes, Hogwarts Good things: Queenie, Tina, Newt, Nicholas Flamel, Grindelwald, Fantastic beasts."

2901,0,1,"What ""Don't we all die, just a little"" from Grindelwald might mean at the end of FBAWTFT Before he says this he was atacked after saying that the statute of secrecy was not acting in favor to the Magical and that it was helping the Muggles (you can rewatch that sceene I think it will make it all clear).  Important to note he takes a very anti-muggle statement here and people with these beleves usually tend to be against muggle-magic relations.  And he says ""don't WE all die just a LITTLE""  WE for me means all wizards and LITTLE as in just a bit (but duh no shit)  I think he means that muggle make the Wizarding blood less pure and so the pure blood 'die a little' since it slowly decase with the mix of more and more Muggle-wizard relationships until evrryone will become, after some point, half bloods if not more muggleborn than half blood.  Grindelwald wanted wizards to be superior to muggles and for them to rule over the muggle world, I think that he'd also be against their cross relationship if one were to rule and be superior to the other.  (Bassicaly they would be slaves that can't be associated with the pure (and less pure) wizards)."

WB will have to do something new and exciting next to make sure it makes more money next time.  They could conclude the Fantastic Beasts Series in movie 3. Then movie 4 and 5 can be completely different wizarding word stories. Or a spinoff with a sequel to Fantastic Beasts. Endless possibilities.  One day, Harry Potter will be like Marvel. There will be so many solo movies of wizarding world stories that will build and connect.  There is only one more movie in the series and then JK continues and concludes it in novel form.  It movies to WB streaming service.  It is cancelled completely.  Or it just continues to be 3 more films in Fantastic Beasts and the audience isn't paid attention to and it pisses people off so much that HP becomes hated like Star Wars. Only to come back with a reboot in 10 years.   It becomes a TV series and concludes in an epic theatre release.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Ruper Grint come back for movies about the next generation, like Star Wars Force Awakens. They are much older now. Harry Potter fans who were in their early teens would now be in their 40's and up. We all now have our Harry Potter movies back but they are nothing like the original 7.

I just finished my rereading of the series and chapter 35: Kings Cross, was really well done and explained a lot of things that could and should be included in the Fantastic Beasts series. Not only did Dumbledore explain about how Voldemort had a major flaw in his plan  , he gave us more insight in his past involving Grindelwald, his family, and the Deathly   Hallows.    As a student in Hogwarts he was a gifted wizard and he had a bright future ahead of him. But he had pain inside him because his six year old sister named Ariana was bullied by muggles who spied on her though a garden hedge, she was using magic that she couldn’t control yet. That day she was afraid of using magic for the rest of her short life. Percival, the father, found the muggles who attacked her, and was sent to Azkaban for assaulting them. Instead of admitting that his daughter was mad, he accepted his life in the wizard prison.   Kendra, the mother, moved them to Godric’s Hallow where she kept her daughter inside for her safety. Everyone thought Ariana was a Squib, but she was most likely an Obscurial, since she was said to be very dangerous. When Ariana was fourteen she accidentally killed her own mother since she couldn’t control herself, and her mother couldn’t calm her down, only Aberforth could, but he was at Hogwarts.   Instead of traveling with his friend Elphias Doge, Albus had to go back home to look after the unstable sister. He hated it because he knew he had a bright future, he could be anywhere and doing anything he wanted, but he was stuck caring for his sister, so naturally he longed for more, even if he loved his family.   Then one day Grindelwald decided to travel to Godric’s hallow because he was looking for the Hallows and he stayed with his great-aunt Bathilda Bagshot during the summer, who happened to be neighbors with Dumbledore. For two whole months these friends were inseparable making up plans to conquer the Wizarding world together and be the Masters of Death with the Hallows. Albus lost his dad to muggles, his sister was bullied by them, so naturally he had resentment towards them, only made worse by Gellert.  It was for “The Greater Good “, which was their slogan. Dumbledore fell for Grindelwald because he was free, he was an equal, he was manipulating Albus, he was in pain, he wanted more and Grindelwald was the solution, at least he though that. For a long time Albus knew Grindelwald was a dark wizard, but he told himself otherwise until Aberforth showed up to end their friendship since Albus was neglecting his sister, and Grindelwald fought first until all three of them were dueling, until Ariana was hit by a spell and was dead. Albus finally realized he was in the wrong and was manipulated by his best friend.   The whole relationship was for two months and for those two months Grindelwald had only two things in his mind, the Hallows and to conquer the Wizarding World, with or without Dumbledore. Jk Rowling announced that Dumbledore was gay, which I accept. I see how he fell for Grindelwald. And I can see how Grindelwald fell for Dumbledore. What I don’t see is them having a sexual relationship or kissing and etc. It was strictly emotional and their number one goal is to be the Master Of Death to conquer the world. There was no time for any of that sort, except emotionally into each other. None would actually come forth with it, especially Grindelwald since he was only using Dumbledore, but he eventually  fell for him, which I’m sure he would ignore as much as possible. What Dumbledore said in this chapter explained it perfectly. I might get hate for this by people who want them to show kissing and what not. But don’t you all agree that it would be out of character? And just better to show them being emotionally involved with one another through the Fantastic Beasts series?"
3219,1,0,"An idea for a new story Set in the Harry Potter universe during the time when Voldemort had taken over. Our main character is a muggle, secretly adopted by wizards and raised believing she is a squib. Soon, however, the death eaters find out about the secret adoption and kidnap the main character's parents for being blood traitors. The main character goes into hiding with the help of her best friend who is terrible at magic (think early Neville), her pet niffler, and a free house elf they meet along the way. Over time she works to free her adoptive parents and uncover the truth about her birth."
3220,1,0,"What scenes were left out from the movies that you think were pivotal to the book plots? Why? For example, I really wanted to see the scenes depicting Merope Gaunt and how her life shifted Tom’s upbringing (I.e. his belief that muggles were weak, yet his witch mother was timid and afraid whereas his muggle father was handsome and rich, thus somewhat disagreeing with his foundational beliefs).   What are your thoughts?"
3235,1,0,"Did Fawkes foreshadow the increasingly hostile relationship between Dumbledore and the Ministry? Okay, hear me out.  So we all know JK is a master wordsmith when it comes to naming her characters... I'm listening to the HP books again via audiobooks and I'm listening to book 2 where Harry meets Fawkes. So this has got me thinking.  Fawkes is an awesome Phoenix name anyway, and a quick Google search shows the origin as 'falcon' which is fitting for, you know, a majestic bird.  But i've always assumed Fawkes was a reference to Bonfire Night/Guy Fawkes Night. Again obvious reference of fire to the firebird.   BUT basically this means that Dumbledore's pet is named after one of British history's most famous rebels. Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Westminster Palace with gunpowder. He failed, but this is weirdly celebrated every November with fireworks.   Knowing what we know about JK's web of plot intricacies, is it possible that by Fawkes also represents the exsisting and eventual destruction of trust between Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic?  Or am I just thinking waaaay too much into this one."

3274,1,0,"Opinion/Rant: Fantastic Beasts (as a film series) is better than the Harry Potter series (as a film series), and the hatred it gets is largely blind and pre-determined As a film series, it’s MILES better than the Potter film series was, two installments in. Sorry, MILES, and from a standpoint of craftsmanship, it marks a high point for the series, as has been said by multiple film critics. I think we need to reconsider, for example, our thoughts on Philosopher’s Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Order of the Phoenix if we’re seriously acting like fucking CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD is a low point. My fuck.   I like the Fantastic Beasts series because they’re much more complex. They confront taboo themes in interesting and mature ways. It allows Rowling’s world-building to shine, and its not boringly confined to one location. It detailed and far more artistically and thematically ambitious. It’s complex, whereas Harry Potter was WAY too simplistic and boring, at least in film form.   The more I consider the criticism of the Fantastic Beasts series, the more I’m seeing how non-fans are dominating the narrative surrounding it. There are 3 videos a day from a bunch of random YouTube accounts that previously never posted *shit* about Harry Potter that all of a sudden have an opinion on an installment of the franchise.   And please, I followed the discourse surrounding both FB films before they opened. After FB1, despite the positive reviews, there was a huge amount of shit-slinging and nit-picking for absolutely no reason, with relatively shallow and outright poorly constructed criticisms that clearly stemmed from people’s lack of understanding of the plot.   For example:   “IT WAS JUST ABOUT FINDING CREATURES. It was boring!”  Well, no, it wasn’t, and it obviously wasn’t, so I really do not have time to even entertain this criticism. The entire film was about Grindelwald attacking NYC with the Obscurus, Credence Barebone, in an effort to expose the Wizarding community. The beasts were a cover for that effort, as they explicitly stated in the dialogue.   But these people didn’t care about that, they wanted to maintain *their* version of the story, simply to justify their reductive view that this series “wasn’t important/was childish/was too simplistic” (and I heard another people say that the film was “too simple/low-stakes”.) Well, all of a sudden, these people sit down for Crimes of Grindelwald, and are *gasp* SHOCKED to find out that the series is *gasp* COMPLEX. And DARK. And features said OBSCURUS trying to discover who he is amidst the manipulation of the ensemble cast of characters, that draws them all to the rally held by Grindelwald, in which they chose sides.   The frustration and therefore the negativity that some people feel toward the film is somewhat understandable, as it functions like a part two and does not, therefore, close or develop *all* if it’s characters and narrative strands to the fullest extent. But the superlatively negative lashing that the film has received is so obviously burdened with pre-determined hatred and Potter-haters just willing failure on the series that I can’t remotely entertain the constant aggressive proselytizing about how “THE FILM SUCKS, AND YOU SHOULD THINK IT DOES TOO”.   Look, there’s ALWAYS objectivity in entertainment and in film criticism in particular, but when you reach such extremes and preach such hyperbole about a film being “the worst film of a series/the month/the year”, (or, alternately, the “best film ever”), you need to provide valid arguments and justification to back that statement up, and simply no one has when it comes to Crimes of Grindelwald.   There are SOME things worth criticizing, such as the fast-and-loose editing and the insufficient running time, and, again, I understand some people’s frustration with how incomplete some of it feels due to the serialized nature of this 5-part story, but these are *little* criticisms at best, and constant, rote, cliché accusations and imputations of “plot holes!” and “bad writing!”, or insistences that the series is just rotten to the core and needs to simplify itself/“change the entire overarching narrative” for you to like it are such lame, low-effort, highly-personal, ignorant criticisms, and they just do not cut it, and provide no solid base on which to place such grandiose accusations of the film franchise being “trash”, or even just “poorly made”.   This, on top of the outrageous amount of unwarranted controversy and abuse Rowling got before the film came out, as well as the snide, dismissive treatment the film got for absolute no reason at all from members of the entertainment media (mocking the title of the film, getting mad that the film ended up on “most anticipated movies of the fall season” polls, or insisting that it would fail at the box office) sort of drives home that the bulk of the criticism around the film, and the negative hyperbole, just isn’t warranted at all.   It looks like a bunch of non-fans and haters jumping at the chance/formulating excuses to trash a successful franchise.   And when all else fails, this franchise is already a billion dollars rich. CoG improved upon the overseas performance of the original. The original film was positively reviewed. The audience response, while more lukewarm than usual, was decent as indicated by IMDb, Google, RT, CinemaScore, and Metacritic, and the franchise has already earned itself an Oscar and a BAFTA. CoG was nominated for a BAFTA and numerous guild awards. The fact that people are jumping at the bit to classify the franchise a failure on top of all this just demonstrates that the “criticism” is irrational and forced."

Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry are the main stars in this search for the Deathly Hallows. Adding Snape seems to be a bit weird to me.  After all, it was Dumbledore who fell to the temptation of seeing the dead again, and put on the ring without thoroughly checking it for curses. In essence, he died because he tried to see his loved ones again.  Yes, Snape also died because he wanted to protect Lily's legacy, but he kinda had nothing to do with the deathly hallows. So having him parallel the brother who died because he fell to the temptation of wanting to be with his loved one again seems a bit odd to me."

Seeing Grindelwald on the Mirror of Erised is probably the most confirmation we'll ever see in the actual movies.   Anyway, my theory is that Dumbledore's greatest desire is the vial containing the blood oath.   The whole Erised sequence showed the creation of the blood oath and then Grindelwald, who *wears* the vial. So I think Dumbledore's greatest desire is to get that vial so that he can finally fight Grindelwald.   Dumbledore most likely still has love for Grindelwald, but I think getting to hung up on his ex is a little bit immature.

They had clothes that looked like it was from another generation but also kind of eccentric. I'm not saying everyone should  be in robes but their clothes should have some flare. Just look at Gilderoy Lockhart, Mad-eye Moody or Rita Skeeter!  A lot of the guys in COG looked like Peaky Blinders or just wore plane boring suits, I think that's why I couldn't see Jude Law as a young Dumbledore. He just looked like a guy and didn't really give off the vibe of the person we know he's going to become.

3697,1,0,"Grindelwald is a good guy Now this might seem like a huge “What no!” scenario, given he is clearly made to be the antagonist who stands in opposition to our protagonists. But what is Grindelwald’s actually message, and are we ever truly given anything that makes sense to counter this? Grindelwald wants wizards to run society, both muggle (no-maj but that name is terrible) and wizard. And you might think this is bad, and totally unfair, and yes, that’s we were all told to think through the Harry Potter series (Voldemort left a bad taste in our mouths). But there is a clear difference between the Voldemort agenda and the Grindelwald agenda. While Voldemort wishes for a grand genocide of what he deems blood filth, Grindelwald does not. Quite to the contrary he wants non magical people to just have a different role in society. And we can say “oh that role means something horrible” but can we say that? He has yet to explain more on this future muggle role in a wizard run society. The only reason we even think it will be a “bad” role in society is because we think he is the antagonist, and all antagonists have bad agendas. And more so, when have we ever seen a competent muggle at all in the Harry Potter series or lore? From all evidence, wizards are basically superior beings to muggles, with literal power of magic on their sides. What evidence is there to let us confidently say we should let, (from all given evidence in lore) incompetent and arguably lesser beings then wizards, muggles run a part of our society? Another point Grindelwald brings up, is that from his agenda so far, he seems to want to bring muggles and wizards into a shared society, which is something all wizard governing bodies oppose. Wizards have the capacity with their magic to alleviate so much pain, sickness, labor, and slow progression of societal building with their magic. There is no disputing this. Grindelwald, while he might have some flawed methodology and enactment of his political and society agenda, has by far a good sensical cause in his mind. I’m open to you guys’ thoughts."

The fashion is especially important to create this effect. When you looked Dumbledore in old movies, you could feel this, but in this movie, the line separate the two world is a little bit vanished. All wizards are almost like Clark Kent. They are hiding as a normal people but if there are trouble, they take off their glasses and begin to fly. Has the fashion developed later in the wizarding world ? When dumbledore decide to wear his clothes which we saw in Harry Potter movies ?   Second, all movie is like a theater with its stages and there are no connectivity between these stages. If it was a final project in an art school, it would be fail. Was there no one watch this movie before it was delivered? Or did they complete it too fast?

3769,1,0,Ariana Dumbledore had Autism- My theory Ok so you know Albus’ younger sister Ariana? I suddenly thought she was autistic but without a diagnosis.  If you think about it- she hated loud noises and bright lights and couldn’t stand Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s loud and bright fight.  She was very protected from being touched- Percival fought some muggles off merely touching Ariana which many autistic people feel uncomfortable when it happens.  She was a late developer- Her learning of magic was slow and uncontrollable and some people on the spectrum have learning difficulties.  She had a favourite to whom only she listened to- Aberforth was her favourite as she listened to him and let him feed her.   Do you agree with my theory?

Some people may not care about these movies about this random guy who isn't Harry Potter, but if there were new book installments in J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, I think more people would eat that up and come out to see the films. Having books to base the movies off of would probably benefit the plots too, as Yates would have a ton of scenes to pick from in composing the film.  & #   *Ugh*. I wish this were happening. Does anyone think novelizations (written by Rowling or not) will ever happen? Has anyone been quoted as saying something that suggests they might?"
3924,0,1,I’d like your attention just for a couple minutes Hello people of reddit! I am currently taking a GT class at my middle school and we have this sort of ongoing project where we get one class period in each GT class every month where we can research or create anything we want. I also take a class where I help the special education kids at my school in class with whatever they need help with. After watching the new fantastic beasts film I noticed that Newt shared many behavioral traits with a couple of the kids in that class who have autism so I looked into it and decided that I’d do some research and write a paper about if Newt does actually have autism. So I’m here to ask you if you’d please take five minutes out of your day to fill out a quick survey with your opinions. Thanks!     (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VL6N7FT)

3969,0,1,"Digital download CoG available as of today (UK) Hi everyone,  & #   I believe the digital download of Crimes of Grindelwald is supposed to be available in the UK as of today. I was just wondering if anyone knows why it isn't available on Amazon? I usually prefer to download things there but noticed it wasn't available. As a back up option I was thinking of using Google Play Store. I went on there yesterday and it confirmed that Google Play at least were intending on releasing today for the UK. Popped onto the Google Play page just now only to see the message 'this movie is not available yet'. Anybody have any idea what's going on? Any other legal download sites people are getting this from?  & #   Thanks very much!"
3974,1,0,"Crimes Of Grindelwald. My alternative posters Well, all these arts were made long BEFORE the film's premiere, so there are a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings.    I made them for an official Warner Bros. contest, but wasn't a winner, Anyway, I love what I did, so just want to show you them!    [I totally loved the phrase from trailer \\""Join me... or die!\\"". I think it really emphasis Grindelwald's power and force. I wanted to show him confident and strong, communicating with watchers, inclining people to his side. ](https://i.redd.it/75zohlqr3fu21.jpg)  [Matagot, one of new creatures shown in film. ](https://i.redd.it/3urz8vrr3fu21.jpg)  & #   [ I was really impressed by the powerful bright dragon-spell conjured by Grindelwald, so this is the base of my composition. Also I divided all main characters into two warring parties. I know I did it wrong! Just want to remind you that this art was made BEFORE world and I saw the film,so art was based only on trailers only! ](https://i.redd.it/zdn6v1ww5fu21.jpg)  [ I deeply respect the human story that opens in the new film. Given what dark times are coming in the history of the magic world, we all need bright colors! That is why I chose the main character of my poster to be the fantastic beast, shown to us in the trailer. Meet ZouWu!](https://i.redd.it/cbvcab985fu21.jpg)  [Nagini! Fascinating story about well-known snake being a women before! Such a connection between Grindelwald and Voldemort, past and future. ](https://i.redd.it/x2w3clqr3fu21.jpg)  [ I want to believe that this wonderful and unique couple will be able to change the future of Maj and No-Maj relationship! By this artwork I wanted to show that \\""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light\\"". These two are bright spots of light in raging storm of passions! This is an art processing \(rendering\) of photos. ](https://i.redd.it/gp617mqr3fu21.jpg)  [I personally count this art as my best from all! I DO love animals a lot and that is what makes me and Newt alike... The motto of this illustration is \\""You never met a monster you couldn't love\\"" phrase by Leta in trailer. I think this words describes Newt's love best! Given what dark times are coming in the history of the magic world, we all need bright colors! That is why I decided to put all new beasts, shown to us in the trailer and promo, together at one poster. I really liked the contrast between the disturbing reality and the bright, pure world of Newt's deep love for his creatures in the first film. Among the gray streets, witch hunters, wars and future tragedies, the journey to Newt's suitcase becomes a real breath of clean air, pure magic! You can see such beasts here: Nagini, Thestral, ZouWu, Kelpie, Leucrotta, Augurey, Matagot, Bowtruckle, Chupakabra and baby Niffler. Also before I saw the film I supposed that Newt was using Appaloosa Puffskein to calm Zouwu down, so at the art Newt is holding it with LeviOsa to distruct beast's attention from all others, but Kelpie is still nervous about this huge lion-like creature :-\)  ](https://i.redd.it/yajpc2sr3fu21.png)  Thank you so much for your time! Hope, you loved the post! &lt;3"

This is the whole Creadence is a Dumbledore because a Phoenix appeared to him and stayed with him. In the Chamber of Secrets, Fawkes appears to Harry, with the Sorting Hat (which contained the Sword of Griffindor) right when Harry needed him the most, as well as using his tears to save Harry.  Soooooooo, does this mean Harry is related to Dumbledore in some way?"
