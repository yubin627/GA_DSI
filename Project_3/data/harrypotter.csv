25,Greytown93,1561036248,"In the Harry Potter series, Luna Lovegood is depicted as the weird, eccentric character that everyone finds a bit odd. However, this makes no sense in the context of Hogwarts. The Wizarding world of J.K. Rowling is a story about a secret society of witches and wizards who are led by a shadow government known as the Ministry of Magic. Along their journey, the main characters encounter giants, monsters, curses, enchantments, and many other examples of the bizarre and paranormal. How is Luna’s “eccentric” behavior even noticed in the midst of all this?

Harry Potter finds out he is being targeted by a dark lord who murdered his parents and split his soul into seven pieces so he could live forever...but he’s weirded out by Luna because she doesn’t always wear shoes?

Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to learn defensive spells to ward off the evil death-eaters that wear dark robes and feed on the souls of their victims. And yet, because Luna believes there are tiny insects that fly into people’s brains and mess with their emotions that makes her cape girl? How can there be a cape girl at Hogwarts? It’s Hogwarts, everyone is cape girl!

100,ABDeborahKlavier5779,1560981304,"The effect of Lily Evans ending her friendship with Severus Snape had to have been colossal. Snape was her childhood friend, who had embraced her as a witch, taught her much of what she understood about magic before attending Hogwarts, protected her from Petunia's envy and bitterness, and accepted her personality without question. 

Did she ever wonder whether there was any possibility of reconciliation in the future? Did she regret her decision? I cannot see her leaving such a strong friendship without regret. The fact that she insisted on being his best friend whilst members of both Houses found their friendship incomprehensible speaks volumes. For example, whilst she criticised Severus' friends for dabbling in Dark Magic, she never used that as a justification to end her friendship with Severus. James Potter, on the other hand, she treated with intense dislike and contempt until...

110,CTRL_ALT_PWN,1560976951,"Reading through Book 7 again.  Xenophilius says that anyone who can unite all three of the Deathly Hallows will become the Master of Death.  Obviously, there are two candidates, Harry and Dumbledore and perhaps Voldemort. 

1. The Elder Wand.  Dumbledore had it ever since his duel with Grindlewald in the 1940's until Voldemort physically stole it from his grave in 1998.  We know that since Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore in book 6, he was its true master.  Here is a wrinkle. Although Harry never held the Elder Wand until after his duel with Voldemort, his physical disarming of Malfoy of his mother's wand in Malfoy Manor was supposed to have transferred ownership of both Malfoy's mom's wand AND the Elder wand to Harry.

2. The Resurrection Stone.  Voldemort turned it into a horcrux.  Dumbledore had it in 1996 and tried to wear it.  He destroyed at least the horcrux part of it.  Harry technically had it the whole time in book 7 but never was able to flip it to ""activate it"" until he was in the forest.  

3. The Invisibility Cloak.  Very controversial.  Voldemort never had it.  Dumblemore borrowed it from James, but this was when Harry was a baby.  Harry was given the cloak his first year at Hogwarts, in 1991.  However, there has been discussion over this was truly the 3rd Hallow.  I wonder if Rowling wanted to take back that Madeye Moody could see through the cloak.  But she also had Bathilda Bagshot(Nagini) able to ""see"" through it.  Maybe Nagini could smell Harry or even Voldemort's soul in Harry.  The Hallow was supposed to be impenetrable, not even death could see through it.  

Dumbledore did not have the ring until 1996(correct me if I am wrong).  By then, Harry had the cloak.  So Dumbledore never had all three at once.  

Harry could have become the Master of Death.  Assuming that is the right cloak, he's had it pretty much through all 7 books.  Assuming he actually was the master of the Elder wand at Malfoy Manor, he had it for half of book 7.  Assuming Dumbledore did not break the stone, Harry was carrying it during all of book 7 and activated it in the forest before Voldemort ""killed"" him.  

TL/DR:  Maybe Harry became master of death.

123,nikko-ish,1560971344,"It’s obvious that we’ve come to terms with the fact that Slytherins are misunderstood and falsely ridiculed people. I have done extensive (and a bit unnecessary ) amounts of research and have come to one conclusion. 

I am a total Slytherin.

Everything i’ve watched and read about slytherins and what traits they tend to posses match up with mine. 

I don’t quite feel like explaining my entire personality to you but here is an example.

I’m never a straight forward person. I admire the way of thoughtfully planning your actions (even though i sometimes forget to) and it just appears idiotic to me to just throw yourself into something and get unjustly praised for it. That only proves you have the luck of a fool.

I have mixed morals. They are all over the place accustomed to my beliefs only.

The dilemma is however, that i feel like a Harry. 

Correct me if i’m wrong, but we all have traits that apply to each house. It is what person we choose and wish to be that really determines our house. Gryffindors are typically people that want to be brave and want have a gryffindor spirit. 

It’s not like i’m nothing like a gryffindor and i’m just hungry for the clout of being one. But what we value is what makes our house (just like the founders). Ultimately, the will to put others before yourself is what i prize most in a persons character.

Finally all the trolls that are going to comment “take the test!1!1!1” I already have. 1000 times. The full test with all the questions available on pottermore have me gryffindor. 

i’m starting to realize that tests are supposed to lead you in the right direction, but my fear of heights isn’t going to determine nor give me an accurate representation of my house.

P.S. i’m not here to ask you to tell me what house i’m in. (Although feel free) I just need someone to tell me whether it’s right to identify as a gryffindor for reasons that are just, even though my personality and values match slytherin????

I feel like if i’m in gryffindor i won’t be true to myself now that i know what slytherins are like and how i fit in SO much, a little too much.
But i feel like in slytherin i won’t be comfortable with the whole “strive through with a one-minded system that will lead you to greatness”

At the end of CoS, he finds evidence that Voldemort had created a Horcrux (the diary) and likely more than one so he’s quite aware that Voldemort could come back and restart a second war. Then the following year, one of Voldemort’s followers, mass murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban on the hunt for Harry and somehow manages to get into Hogwarts. You’d think with the looming danger ahead, Dumbledore would’ve made learning to duel a prime priority for students and asked Lupin to bring them up to speed on jinxes, curses and how to counter or avoid them. Instead, the class spends their year learning about dark creatures such as boggart, kappas and redcaps which while not useless especially the Riddikulus Spell would be less important than knowing how to defend yourself against another wizard. Plus, the class had already spent the last year learning about fighting monster from Lockhart. Yes, he was a fraud but the monster hunts were true just not who did them.

As you see, its a very textbook-ish type of deal. 

I've been writing for almost 4 hours now and already got 6 pages (and a 7th page with an ""applied concept"" on the inner workings of the tracer) 

The pages up to now contain absolutely no images. 

What i've been writing is section 1: introduction, which is a basic 1 page ""what is magical theory, what does it explore and why is relevant"" description... 

Then section 2: fundamentals, chapter 1 realms and their relationships 

Dealing with the 4 distincts realms: physical, Animic (thoughts, emotions, spirit, intent, ideas, memories, mind), realm of the beyond (basically the other side of the veil) time and space (which i know its physical but i will reserve for things like basic apparition, floo network and such. 


I'm supper hypped. After sect. 2 ch. 1 i will do a couple of chapters on why wizards can use muggles and wizards not (dont worry, wont get super scientific, mostly a ""they were born without an open channel for animic energy to flow through"" or smth like that.

248,nikko-ish,1560891605,"I’m going to Universal soon to visit Harry Potter World and if i’m going to spend hundreds of dollars on house merchandise, it better be the right one . 

My main problem with identifying as a house is that i see myself in all of them, but none of them at the same time.

Ex. Gryffindor : I posses the need to be a leader and stand up for what is right and just. But I have a huge sense of what is practical and would never put myself in a dumb situation.

THIS IS THE CASE FOR ALL HOUSES 
I have traits that fit into them equally, but i still feel not quite 100% a particular house.

I’m here on reddit to give various opinions on what house you think i belong in based on the traits i give to you guys. 

I see myself as...

A person that sets extremely high standards for myself, and when i end up not being “the best” at something i just started at, i get VERY frustrated and end up quitting.

I’m a smart person, but i don’t wish to posses wisdom and knowledge for the sake of learning, but for the sake of using it to have an effect on the world.

If i really want to do something, i do it to the point of perfection. my determination is a quality i value a lot. 

However, if i show any disinterest to something, i will try to find an easy way out of it, rather than work for it .  

However, i could care less about smarts, or getting the job done. If you don’t have a good heart or intentions, what does it speak about your character?

I will admit, that validation is VERY appealing to me, it’s something i rarely admit. 


Lastly, I would like to mention that I view myself as a gryffindor currently. 

I feel like if i was able to recognize and traits of ravenclaw besides “witty or creative or open minded” i would be that. However, at the moment i can’t seem to really connect with any ravenclaw traits because they seem to all have relation to intellect.

After reading what i’m like you might see me as a slytherin. I just can’t see myself willing to do something if it hurt others, especially if there was a different, even harder, option.

Hufflepuff is a wonderful house. I admire Hufflepuffs, but i could never truly be one. i value what is right over what is easy, or what is appealing. But when it comes down to it, my pride and validation from others gets in the way of that. 

Griffin for just seems to fit in with me. Nobody seems to want to be a gryffindor anymore, and if you are one most people assume that you are a dumb adrenaline junkie. if i were in battle, i would most like to see myself fighting until the end with my friends by my side. DO NOT GET ONE THING WRONG WHEN I SAY THIS, i would never NEVER do something extremely stupid, just for the high of doing something reckless, but rather because it is right and just.

251,Blahblah779,1560888871,"Recently I came to the realization that Snape didn't need to share all that he did with Harry in The Prince's Tale. Showing his scenes with Dumbledore explaining that Harry was a horcrux would have convinced him, since it fit the puzzle so well. It's a no brainer once you think about it.

That means that every scene between Snape and Lily, Snape CHOSE to show to Harry, even though he didn't need to.

Here's the clincher. Snape has come to know Harry well enough to know that when Harry sees the memories, he would go to die, especially in the context of being in the middle of the battle of Hogwarts as it was when Snape died.

This means that Snape didn't choose to show Harry his memories for any alternate motive. He gave them only to Harry, believing that he would be the only one to ever see them, and die shortly after.

Snape could never have opened up in anything less than a death bed confession scenario. He was too rooted in his ways and too proud to ever confess his motives to anyone. It would just be weird for Snape to open up in any lesser circumstance. It wouldn't fit. But JK sets up the PERFECT scenario where Snape is ultimately able to gain his redemption, only in his last moments, and only *because* they're his last moments, by having the courage to give Harry the gift of showing him his true self.

The only explanation that I can see here is that Bill was having portions of his face bitten off by a fully human wizard, not a wolf. Like, another man had him pinned down and was chewing on his face.

269,Shrekosaurus_rex,1560877224,"*""Some people are born great, others achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Contrary to the famous quote, I don't think it's quite as simple as that. You don't often fit exclusively into one category, and Harry Potter is particularly difficult to place.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Born great** \- he was the Chosen One, he grew up famous, though he didn't know it. He gained the title at age one, practically his entire life. Even before Hogwarts, wizards in the street were staring at him, at his scar, at the Boy Who Lived - and it became nearly universal in the Wizarding World.
2. **Achieved greatness** \- Harry, though he had luck and plenty of help, didn't defeat Voldemort by accident or chance or only because Dumbledore was pulling the strings; without Dumbledore, Snape, Hermione and others he most likely would never have defeated Voldemort - or at least would've taken longer - but it wasn't solely their work. *He* saved Sirius life,  *he* overpowered Voldemort through the connection, in the graveyard. Few people, if placed in the exact same circumstances, with the exact same resources, could've done what he did.
3. **Greatness thrust upon him** \- he had his fate intertwined with Voldemort; he didn't ask for it, want it or do anything to deserve it - not until his Hogwarts years, at least - and yet it still happened because of circumstances outside of his control. Dealing with his fame, the Prophecy, his expectations...none of them were his choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Harry could fit into any one of these categories - or all of them.People don't often fit into one category and one alone. Even some of the reasons listed for one could easily fit into another. Being born as the Chosen One would definitely count as having greatness thrust upon him, especially since it was because of a Prophecy.

&amp;#x200B;

This logic can be applied to almost any character - in fiction or the real world - though some clearly fit into one more than another. Someone who earned fame through a particular skill could simply have been born talented.So my question is this:

# Which category - or combination - do you think Harry best fits into?

And where would you put Hermione, or Ron? What about Neville? Snape? Dumbledore? There are plenty of characters in Harry Potter who could fit into any one of these three categories - or none of them, perhaps achieving greatness through some other, unorthodox manner.

301,alexandra10566,1560846778,"I love Harry Potter,  I remember watching the first Harry Potter movie in my living room when it first came out, hiding in my bed covers when the film got particularly dark, and I remember reading the book and falling inside its pages a few years after that. This film/books are ingrained in me, and they mean a lot to me as they do to every potter head however, we must all admit that there are still a few thing about the story that don’t add up, or doesn’t make sense. like why did Harry not end up with Hermione!!! Ok, yea I know there’s much debate behind that one, and I don’t want to start a war here so let’s put that one aside for another day. 

Anyways, going back to that first time I watched the Philosopher’s stone, I remember how I watched it with my older brothers and how they were confused as to why the challenges Harry faced were so easy? Now back then I was more interested in the nice story about a boy wizard, and I didn’t really pay much attention to what they said, but now I -much like many before me, and ahead of me- wonder the same thing. 

Why would Dumbledore, the best wizard of the age make the challenges to get the stone, easy enough for a first year to get through? The answer is quite simple, he made it so Harry could get through it. This answer is incredibly simple, and I’m sure many of you have come to this conclusion, but why would Dumbledore do this? Why put an eleven year old in danger? Why pit the darkest meanest wizard in history against a boy who could barely use one spell? Was it to challenge him? Was it to teach him something? Was it groom him to be the hero of the Wizarding world? Was it to test Harry, and see if he was really the chosen one?

Let’s pull back a little here, and go back to why Dumbledore is the one who orchestrated it all, before we go into why he did it. Well first of all we first learn of the stone when Hagrid takes Harry to retrieve it at Gringotts, isn’t this too much of a coincidence? Here we have Hagrid bringing dear, young, clueless Harry to the most protected bank in the Wizarding world to retrieve one of Wizarding kinds most valuable artifact. Now, if Dumbledore really wanted to protect the stone he wouldn’t have told Hagrid -a good fellow, but overall bad at keeping secrets- to get the stone, much less when he knew Harry would be with him. That’s strike 1 Dumbledore.  

Next we have the fact that Dumbledore brought it to Hogwarts, now granted that Hogwarts is probably one of the safest place on earth, so that makes sense, so we’ll let this one slide. Now, we got the problem with the mirror of Erised. Oh why, why would Dumbledore leave the mirror -which he claims to be dangerous- in a room, a room which he knew Harry would find? I don’t think I have to explain this one much, just the fact that Dumbledore came to visit when Harry found it is prof enough that he knew he would stumble upon it, and that he probably planed him to. Alright, so Dumbledore made it so Harry would find the mirror and learn about its properties, ensuring that he knew what the mirror did when he went through the trap door. Strike two Dumbledore. 

Now as for strike three, I won’t go into the fact that the challenges were so easy, we already know that. No, for strike three we’ll go into why Dumbledore left Hogwarts just when the school needed him most? Once more, the answer is simple. He -like Hermione- knew that Voldemort wouldn’t make his move if he was around the school to stop him, and since he wanted Harry to face him he had no other choice but to leave the school, thus putting his whole plan into motion. He knew Voldemort would make his move, and he knew Harry would figure everything out by then, and since he knew Harry had his mother’s protection he knew he wasn’t in any danger... you know apart from being killed by quirrell instead of Voldemort, or getting horribly mangled by the countless other dangers, they had a three headed dog guarding the entrance for crying at loud! Anyways, just the fact that Dumbledore -an incredibly smart wizard- just outright left when he was needed the most, has to make this one strike three, there was no way he didn’t know this would happen.

Now, before I conclude let me rephrase what I said before. I don’t think Dumbledore is a villain per say, he didn’t want to Harry to get killed or horribly hurt, but with all the evidence against him, I can’t say he wasn’t responsible. Dumbledore definitely orchestrated the whole thing, just as he did with countless other things Harry faced in his life. 

So what do you think, is Dumbledore innocent, or guilty?",harrypotter,"Dumbledore is the real villain in the Philosopher’s stone, and the one who orchestrated the whole thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c1zpah/dumbledore_is_the_real_villain_in_the/,1560817978.0

327,TheVerySpecialK,1560825005,"Disclaimer: the fourth book is probably my favorite overall. However, that hasn't shut my eyes to what is arguably one of the biggest plot contrivances of the entire series: Harry mysteriously getting his name put into the Goblet and then having to compete in the Triwizard Tournament regardless of whether he wanted to or not (despite being under the established age-limit), all so he can ""win"" the tournament and get whisked off to Voldemort by a portkey trophy. Indeed! Now, I am fully aware of the fact that having your name come out of the Goblet is a ""binding magical contract."" Break the contract, something bad happens. That's fine, but let's look at this closer: **did Harry *really* have to compete?**

For starters, the definition of ""competing"" in the Triwizard Tournament is never made clear: Dumbledore warns the students that once you are in (i.e., your name is selected by the Goblet) you have to see the tournament through to the end, but that's about it. Now, on its face that looks like enough: Harry's name comes out of the Goblet and so he has to stick it out and compete just like Dumbledore said. However, as the book goes on it quickly becomes clear that things aren't that simple. First, it is established quite early on that *cheating does not constitute a violation of the Triwizard contract*, as all four champions learn about the dragons in the first task beforehand and nothing bad happens to them. Second, and more importantly, it is also established that ** *outsider interference with competitors in the tournament that renders competitors unable to compete does not constitute a violation of the Triwizard contract*.** This is demonstrated in the third task when Barty Crouch Jr. uses spells against both Fleur Delacour and Viktor Krum that prevent them from competing in the task so that Harry can get to the portkey first. 

So, if both cheating and outsider interference do not count as violations of the definition of ""competing"" in the Triwizard Tournament (at least as far as the Goblet is concerned), *this also suggests that the tournament organizers had at their disposal means of restricting Harry from competing in the tournament that would not have caused Harry to break the binding magical contract from the Goblet*. For instance, the organizers could have placed Harry under some sort of spell at the beginning of each task to prevent him from taking part in said tasks. Why would they want to do this in the first place? Because, as Karkaroff and Madame Maxime point out, Harry taking part gives Hogwarts an unfair advantage (two champions as opposed to the one each for Beauxbatons and Durmstrang). If Harry didn't *really* have to compete, then there was no reason for the organizers to not seek out some roundabout way of restricting his participation on the grounds of maintaining a level playing field between the schools (which for me was the real crux of the issue anyways, not the age limit).",harrypotter,Harry should have been restricted from competing in the Triwizard Tournament,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c1wmoc/harry_should_have_been_restricted_from_competing/,1560796205.0

Obviously the first turn was seeing The Prince's Tale in the final movie (although in the movies he's not even that terrible in the first place besides killing Dumbledore which was way more telegraphed what with snape seeing harry under the tower) Snape sorta bad -&gt; Snape good

&amp;#x200B;

The second was when I was finally reading the books about a year ago, and it was revealed that Snape was the one who heard the prophecy and ultimately got the Potters killed by telling Voldemort. I was pretty buzzed up and I cried my eyes out in hatred and at the fact that I'd been tricked into liking Snape by the movies. He was the absolute WORST and anything good he did, he did only out of a duty to serve Lily's memory. Snape good -&gt; Snape terrible

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I've read through the series a couple more times and read many discussions on this sub, and for the most part I had fallen into the ""Snape is grey"" lot. I still think that he's a giant douche almost all the time and \*most\* of the good things he did, he did not because he was good, but just out of a sense of duty to Lily, since he got her killed... One could argue that doing good things for the wrong reasons is the first step towards goodness, but I didn't think Snape would ever take any further steps towards it, he's too rooted in bitterness still. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this morning, I was re listening to an episode of Binge Mode HP, specifically the episode on The Prince's Tale. They were talking about how as Snape was dying, he was desperate to share his memories, to be understood. And here's where I came to the third turn:

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that a ton of the content of ""The Prince's Tale"" \*\*didn't need to be there\*\*.  Snape didn't NEED to be so open with Harry. He could have gotten the message across that Harry was a horcrux in far fewer memories and without putting his shame out there for Harry to see. Furthermore, he knows that Harry will go to die after seeing the memories, so he's not sharing them in the hopes that everyone will appreciate his sacrifice. It means that much to him just that HARRY understands him. I have always been reluctant to believe that Snape cared for Harry, but here's the proof.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course that doesn't retroactively make him a good person throughout the story, so Snape as a character still falls into morally grey, but I now firmly believe that at the least, Snape died as a good character who truly cared for Harry. And I think that's enough for me to switch over to Team Snape.

Both the Patronus charm and the dementors substantially affect the brain, specifically the mood centre and this especially true for dementors who make their victims relive their worst and saddest memories. From Lupin, we learn that a palliative for the dementors' effect is eating chocolate, but it was never explained why that was the case.

However, when you look at it from the Muggle's perspective, it makes a whole lot of sense: Aside from the popular belief that ""chocolate makes you feel happy"", scientifically, it has been theorised that one of the positive effects of chocolate is *to improve depression, stress and anxiety symptoms and to help enhance feelings of calmness and contentedness.* This is done via both the **flavanols** and **methylxanthines**, which are believed to play a role in chocolate’s mood-enhancing effects.

Whether it's based on a popular belief or from scientific research, it's a testament to Rowling's ability to leverage every bit of tidbit she gleans from her material research to make the world she weaved more believable and magical.

341,peepeeandpoopooman,1560810224,"For verbal spells that use a wand, the spell is complete after the caster finishes saying it. And of course how quick you can point your wand.

The books make us believe that winning a duel is about who is most skilled in duelling-magic. To an extent this is true, more talented wizards will know about and be able to cast a wider range of spells with greater efficiency. But, especially when you watch some of the duels in the later movies, it really does just look like it's about who can point their wand and shout the fastest. Like a gunfight except to fire the gun instead of pulling a trigger you have to shout what bullet you want it to fire.

So I would have imagined vocal training would be a big thing in the Harry Potter universe, especially for wizards who may stutter for example. Which means what would happen if a wizard did have a terrible stutter or dyslexic/dyspraxia? Would that severely limit their magical ability? What if a wizard was deaf/mute?

So could this mean a very knowledgable, skilled and experienced wizard could be beaten in a duel by a kid who can simply speak and point faster?

1. We know Gryffindor and Slytherin we're good friends who fell out but did anyone think about Ravenclaws story? Her daughter ran away with her diadem and she was heartbroken. She then sends a guy to find her who effing kills her. That's just heartbreaking. No wonder hufflepuffs are the only safe house. 

2. Nearly headless Nick is a 500 year old ghost in CoS. But Hogwarts is more than a thousand years old. And the Bloody Baron and the Grey Lady have been around almost since the inception. Idk about the fat friar. Did the concept of house ghosts just come into being later on or was Gryffindors ghost replaced?

3. In Snapes last convo with Voldemort right before he was killed, he constantly keeps on begging to let him find Harry. He's figured out that the good guys are losing and he wants to save Harry and tell him the important stuff. Once he realizes Voldemort is going to kill him he grows even more desperate, ""Please let me go find the boy"", because he's terrified the truth will die with him. 

4. Just something I found a little odd. Wasn't Harry interested in telling Dumbledore that Remus and Tonks died when they met on Kings Cross?

5. The potion book of the half blood prince got burned by the fiendfyre :(. Just makes me sad. 

6. Lastly, this one may be unpopular. Upon rereading HBP I feel that Voldemort truly didn't know about how to make Horcruxes when he asked slughorn.

431,acerthorn,1560764062,"In Deathly Hallows, Chapter 37 (""The Flaw in the Plan""), Harry tells Voldemort that he is actually the master of the Elder Wand because he disarmed Draco Malfoy who disarmed Dumbledore. When Voldemort calls his bluff, his killing curse rebounds off of Harry, just like it did sixteen years prior, only this time, because there are no more horcruxes, it kills Voldemort for realsies.

I always found this ending to be rather unsatisfactory. For one, it comes out of nowhere. It's pretty well documented how convenient it is that Harry lucks his way into owning the Elder Wand, so I won't bore you with the details here, but more importantly than that, it is also thematically unsatisfying. As I point out in this thread, the main themes of the series are the inevitability of death and the power of love, and Voldemort is ultimately undone by neither of these two things, at least not directly.

Well, I just thought of a fan theory that actually clears a lot of this up: Harry didn't survive Voldemort's final spell because Voldy was using Harry's own wand against him. He survived because ... drum roll please ...

...

... those who fought on the side of the Order in the Battle for Hogwarts and died in that battle (such as Fred Weasley, Tonks, Lupin, etc.) bestowed sacrificial protection to Harry when they died!

In order for sacrificial protection to form, one must give their lives to save another. The sacrificial lamb must be given the chance to live, but consciously choose death. Well, the Battle for Hogwarts was being fought to protect Harry, so that box is checked. All those who fought for the Order in that battle were all doing so willingly. They had every opportunity to not show up for the battle in the first place or flee the battle any point prior to their own deaths, so them staying there and fighting until the bitter end should certainly qualify as going out of their way to die.

The only real technicality I see with this theory is that Voldemort himself didn't personally kill any of them. However, the death eaters, who were acting on his behalf and on his orders, did. The question is whether the death eaters can cause sacrificial protection on behalf of their master. Frankly, I see no reason why they cannot. In Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, Quirrel couldn't touch Harry because of the sacrificial protection. Sure, maybe it was because he was sharing a body with Voldemort at the time, but the implication seems to be that no servant of Voldemorts can touch Harry with the intent of hurting him because of the protection.

In other words, the protection applies vicariously to the death eaters as well as Voldemort himself.

Well, I see no reason why it can't work in both directions. If the sacrificial protection can flow from principle to agent, I see no reason why it can't also flow from agent to principle. For that matter, I see no reason why it can't flow from agent to agent! For example, if Durnihov kills Fred Weasley, that bestows sacrificial protection onto Harry against Durnihov and Voldemort. Then, if Yaxley (who is also working on Voldemort's behalf) attacks Harry, that spell would likewise rebound on Yaxley, because Durnihov created the protection that Voldemort can't touch him, and therefore, Yaxley can't touch him on Voldemort's behalf either.

In addition to this being much more consistent with the plot, it is also much more satisfying thematically (although I realize that's subjective). First, it causes Voldemort to be undone by the power of love, which is one of the main themes and therefore what should be what ultimately saves the day.

Second, it brings Harry's journey full circle. Harry's journey with Voldemort began when his mother sacrificed herself to save Harry, and it ends when Harry's friends sacrifice themselves to save him. The snitch opens at the close? Well, Harry's journey closes at the open!

Last but not least, this ties the prophecy together in a nice little ribbon. The prophecy says that Harry will have the power to vanquish the dark lord, and that Harry will have power the dark lord knows not. In Half-Blood Prince, it is made clear that this power is the power of love, and Dumbledore spends half an entire chapter in that book building up how powerful and exceptional the power of love is. By having this power be a direct contributing factor in Voldemort's ultimate defeat, it is much easier to accept this as giving Harry the power to vanquish Voldemort, rather than simply lucking his way into the circumstances needed for survival.

Now, we still have the problem of Harry being sent to purgatory in the Forest. If he was protected by some renewed sacrificial protection, how did Harry end up in purgatory? Well, remember this little exchange between Harry and Dumbledore during purgatory:

    ""I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!""

    ""And that,"" said Dumbledore, ""will, I think, have made all the difference.""

Well, there ya go! Will sacrificial protection still protect the beneficiary, even when the beneficiary actively does not want to be protected? I would say not!

Bear in mind, after Harry returns to the world of the living, he keeps his eyes shut, but he hears that Voldemort has been knocked down. The implication is that he has been out cold for as long as Harry has. So it certainly seems as if Voldemort's curse had some kind of backfiring effect on it, even if it didn't destroy his body.

So what do you guys think? Is my theory sound? Does it make the ending to the series more thematically satisfying?",harrypotter,Fan Theory: The REAL reason Harry survived against Voldemort's final spell,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c1lj94/fan_theory_the_real_reason_harry_survived_against/,1560735262.0
433,acerthorn,1560763796,"In Deathly Hallows, Chapter 37 (""The Flaw in the Plan""), Harry tells Voldemort that he is actually the master of the Elder Wand because he disarmed Draco Malfoy who disarmed Dumbledore. When Voldemort calls his bluff, his killing curse rebounds off of Harry, just like it did sixteen years prior, only this time, because there are no more horcruxes, it kills Voldemort for realsies.

I always found this ending to be rather unsatisfactory. For one, it comes out of nowhere. It's pretty well documented how convenient it is that Harry lucks his way into owning the Elder Wand, so I won't bore you with the details here, but more importantly than that, it is also thematically unsatisfying. As I point out in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/au75ar/botched_execution_of_central_themes/), the main themes of the series are the inevitability of death and the power of love, and Voldemort is ultimately undone by neither of these two things, at least not directly.

Well, I just thought of a fan theory that actually clears a lot of this up: Harry didn't survive Voldemort's final spell because Voldy was using Harry's own wand against him. He survived because ... drum roll please ...

... 

... those who fought on the side of the Order in the Battle for Hogwarts and died in that battle (such as Fred Weasley, Tonks, Lupin, etc.) bestowed sacrificial protection to Harry when they died!

In order for sacrificial protection to form, one must give their lives to save another. The sacrificial lamb must be given the chance to live, but consciously choose death. Well, the Battle for Hogwarts was being fought to protect Harry, so that box is checked. All those who fought for the Order in that battle were all doing so willingly. They had every opportunity to not show up for the battle in the first place or flee the battle any point prior to their own deaths, so them staying there and fighting until the bitter end should certainly qualify as going out of their way to die.

The only real technicality I see with this theory is that Voldemort himself didn't personally kill any of them. However, the death eaters, who were acting on his behalf and on his orders, did. The question is whether the death eaters can cause sacrificial protection on behalf of their master. Frankly, I see no reason why they cannot. In Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, Quirrel couldn't touch Harry because of the sacrificial protection. Sure, maybe it was because he was sharing a body with Voldemort at the time, but the implication seems to be that no servant of Voldemorts can touch Harry with the intent of hurting him because of the protection.

In other words, the protection applies vicariously to the death eaters as well as Voldemort himself.

Well, I see no reason why it can't work in both directions. If the sacrificial protection can flow from principle to agent, I see no reason why it can't also flow from agent to principle. For that matter, I see no reason why it can't flow from agent to agent! For example, if Durnihov kills Fred Weasley, that bestows sacrificial protection onto Harry against Durnihov and Voldemort. Then, if Yaxley (who is also working on Voldemort's behalf) attacks Harry, that spell would likewise rebound on Yaxley, because Durnihov created the protection that Voldemort can't touch him, and therefore, Yaxley can't touch him on Voldemort's behalf either.

In addition to this being much more consistent with the plot, it is also much more satisfying thematically (although I realize that's subjective). First, it causes Voldemort to be undone by the power of love, which is one of the main themes and therefore what should be what ultimately saves the day.

Second, it brings Harry's journey full circle. Harry's journey with Voldemort began when his mother sacrificed herself to save Harry, and it ends when Harry's friends sacrifice themselves to save him. The snitch opens at the close? Well, Harry's journey closes at the open!

Last but not least, this ties the prophecy together in a nice little ribbon. The prophecy says that Harry will have the power to vanquish the dark lord, and that Harry will have power the dark lord knows not. In Half-Blood Prince, it is made clear that this power is the power of love, and Dumbledore spends half an entire chapter in that book building up how powerful and exceptional the power of love is. By having this power be a direct contributing factor in Voldemort's ultimate defeat, it is much easier to accept this as giving Harry the power to vanquish Voldemort, rather than simply lucking his way into the circumstances needed for survival.

Now, we still have the problem of Harry being sent to purgatory in the Forest. If he was protected by some renewed sacrificial protection, how did Harry end up in purgatory? Well, remember this little exchange between Harry and Dumbledore during purgatory:

&gt; ""I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!""

&gt; ""And that,"" said Dumbledore, ""will, I think, have made all the difference.""

It begins with her writing to Hogwarts and accepting her placement at the school: asking all sorts of questions and trying to get as much information at she could. 

First year: she’s telling her parents how excited she is and so on and then after Halloween, there’s a signed disciplinary letter for “attempting to take on a mountain troll alone. “ a see you soon letter when it got close to end of term

Second year: she is excited to be back at Hogwarts and explaining to her mom what the polyjuice potion would do. Then another letter signed by McGonagall stating she had been petrified but that an antidote would be made in time for the end of the year. A letter answering all her parents questions about what a basilisk is and a secret chamber

Third year: she not writing as much. Every letter sounds stressed and hurried. She assures her parents she has plenty of time to get to all her studies. Confirmation of tea with Hagrid. 

Fourth year: she sends a letter from the Burrow before the World Cup. Then another a few days later saying she loves her parents. One mentioning how lovely it’ll be that the triwizard tournament will be for people over 17 and she definitely won’t have to be involved. A letter to Sirius about how worried she was about Harry and his scar and his being in the tournament and the *dragons* Several letters to the ministry about Elf Rights. A thank you note for the Easter egg from Molly. Another letter from school attached with her own account of Cedrics death. A first letter to Krum. 

Fifth year: Letters to Harry with little to no helpful information about the order of the Phoenix. Then letter home to say she was a prefect ! Letters to Sirius checking in and worrying about Harry’s hand. Letters assuring her parents her new club is safe and will help her in her studies. Letters to Krum that were blissfully about his life at Durmstrang and took her out of the life at Hogwarts every now and then. 

Sixth year: letters to the Burrow making sure she could stay with the Weasleys again. Letters home became less frequent. She’s writing to the ministry inquiring about internships and possible open positions in the department of magical relations. 

Seventh year: an unsent goodbye letter to her parents. Discreet muggle-sent letters to Lupin and Molly and Arthur about Harry and Ron and her.",harrypotter,Retelling through Hermione’s Letters,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c1kltb/retelling_through_hermiones_letters/,1560727200.0

McGonagall appearing in FB before she was born, her birth year then being removed from her profile on Pottermore. I know there are many more inconsistencies throughout the film but something as big as this really makes me question how much thought was put into the story.

 I am even put off from reading fan theories as i fear more thought is put into those than the actual film.

468,acerthorn,1560723338,"Just before beginning his horcrux-hunting mission with Ron &amp; Hermoine, Molly Weasley mentions that, if Dumbledore wanted something done badly enough, he had the whole Order at his command.

You know, that's actually a valid point. Why wouldn't Dumbledore have simply told a bunch of aurors like Moody or Kingsley ... you know, people who's literal job it is to find and destroy dark magic ... about the horcruxes?

Now, after reading the whole book, we eventually get the reason why it has to be Harry. Because Harry is a horcrux, and therefore, Harry himself must walk over to Voldemort of his own accord so he can be killed.

But for the vast majority of the events of Deathly Hallows, Harry doesn't know that. Despite not knowing this, he says with 100% conviction, on at least two occasions (with Molly just before heading off on his mission, and then with Aberforth just before entering Hogwarts), that it has to be him. At no point does he ever question the inevitability of his mission.

Was there ever any objective reason - one that Harry was aware of at the time of those two conversations - that actually required Harry to be the one to track down the horcruxes?

And before anyone replies, no, it isn't the prophecy. In Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 23 (""Horcruxes""), Dumbledore explains to Harry that the prophecy only has significance because Harry and Voldemort choose to give it such. Harry is absolutely free to turn his back on the prophecy, but his burning desire to avenge his parents is what's forcing him down this path, not the prophecy itself. So no, the prophecy alone isn't enough of a reason.

Besides, even if the prophecy were directly binding on the parties (which it's not), it only foretells the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort, not Harry's hunt for the horcruxes. I see no reason why Harry couldn't have used the assistance of the numerous aurors who were already in the Order to help him track down the horcruxes, as well as find ways to destroy them that didn't require the exceptionally rare basilisk venom or the impossible-to-control fiendfyre.

Hell, I'd imagine that the aurors probably already knew what horcruxes were. I can totally buy that learning what these things are and how to deal with them is just part of standard Auror training. The only reason they didn't put two and two together regarding Voldemort is because Voldemort had more than one horcrux, which was completely unprecedented and therefore the symptoms of multiple horcruxes wouldn't be well documented. But once Harry explained to an experienced auror (such as Moody or Kingsley) that Voldemort had some horcruxes, the Auror Office probably would have had standard procedures for tracking down and then safely disposing of horcruxes.

So yeah ... prior to Harry learning that he himself was a horcrux, what exactly made Harry so damn stubborn that he personally had to be the one to track them down?",harrypotter,Why did Harry feel like he had to be the one to track down the horcruxes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c1fpyt/why_did_harry_feel_like_he_had_to_be_the_one_to/,1560694538.0

Basically last year of hogwarts and the marauders decided that they needed to pass along the map with all their accumulated knowledge. So they all agree to pass on the map the map to worthy students who could cause just as much havoc and pranks they did.

They decided the best way to choose a worthy successor is to put the map in filches office where students would go for being caught when doing pranks. And when the student finds the map it will find qualities in the student the best match up makes the map open.

This explains why Fred and George got the map with them being some of the biggest trouble makers and how it went (most likely) unfound by any student since the marauders left school.

I don’t have many vivid memories from my childhood, all of them are blurry but I remember this scene very well: he was standing right behind me and our living room was washed with and orange afternoon sunlight. He was quite right, as I LOVED it and finished it in an instant. He picked it up after me and he loved it too and with every new book, we read the same book together, me during the day, and him at night when I’m asleep (that is, if I could restrain myself from finishing them in a day). We would get overly hyped about them. He absolutely loved Dumbledore and he himself had kind of a Dumbledore-y vibe to him.

I also remember closing the cover on the last book years later, I was alone in my room in a different house, same orange afternoon light shining on me. Lots had changed, my dad was gone because they were divorced, we had to move from that beautiful house, and my relationship with my dad was quite strained. 

I remember re-watching the first movie with him at his place last year when he was sick. He was very sick and tired but I could see how happy he was. He wanted to show them to his girlfriend and we were planning to watch them all but we couldn’t.

I lost him in september. I wish I could call him today and tell him that I’m reading and watching them again, for the bazillionth time, as I have always done since that day and this has been his greatest gift to me. I’ve always turned to Harry Potter in my time of need and nothing else comforted me better for the past 20 years. It’s one my favourite things in the world and always will hold a more than special place in my heart.

I gotta admit, I really liked the animation, cuz it was so colorful and cute, it was really well done in general, and it may be my favorite part of the game.
Another thing I thought was fun was the dual fights. They were very similar to rock, paper and scissors, but it was entertaining non the less. However, you rarely get to duel, which was very disappointing.

That's is, that's all I like about the game, there is nothing else redeemable about the game.

Hopefully this is allowed here because it is about the actors not the series itself.

However that doesnt change the fact that they're DEMs or then you could explain away any DEMs if you read between the lines hard enough

For example. How did Fawkes find harry, How does he even get into the chamber since the entrance collapses, apparently not even the best wizards couldve found the chamber? Does fawkes have GPS?

How did Fawkes even scratch out the Basilisk's eye without fawkes himself being petrified assuming hed be petrified instead of dying since he cant die. If he closed his eyes when flying into the chamber how would he have known the positioning of the basilisk to successfully claw out its eyes? 

Harry Burning Quirrel through the power of Love is just a downright DEM it sounded like an excerpt from Pokemon at times.

How did the stone appear in Harry's Pocket? It's never said that the mirror gives it to you. Nor would it be obvious enough for a viewer to figure it out. Without deep thought?

How did Tom Riddle even discover the chamber himself and the basilisk?  

How did dobby originally find Harry or apparate to him if presumably harry was placed with a muggle family that only Dumbledore and the relevant people involved knew about to protect him? 

Does the plot just let everyone find the chamber of secret on a need to know basis?

-Wormtail. Amazing *Stealth*, decent *Mobility* and *Survivability*. Not much *Attack Damage* but you don't need much as an animal when you can turn into a wizard capable of using blasting curses. Of the three Animagus Marauders he's the one who survives the longest. A-Tier. 

-Skeeter's Beetle. Pretty much minmaxed for highest possible *Stealth* and better *Mobility* thanks to the *Flight* ability, but very little *Survivability* and no *Attack Damage*, so highly vulnerable once discovered. Also has to worry about surprise attacks from birds. Still, Rita manages to turn this form into a viable career. A-Tier. 

-McGonagall's Cat. Good *Stealth* since cats are common, although it's compromised if the enemy knows her fur pattern. Decent *Mobility* thanks to the *Climb* ability. Good *Survivability* since cats have almost no predators to fear and the form presents a relatively small target for curses. Also pretty decent *Attack Damage* with the *Scratch* and *Bite* moves, good enough to escape. Enhanced senses such as *Night Vision* and improved smell and hearing. Good all-rounder. B-Tier. 

-Padfoot. Pretty comparable to McGonagall's Cat, but less *Stealth* since dogs usually aren't alone and he's quite unusually big. Higher speed but no *Climb*, higher *Attack Damage* (good enough to cause serious damage in humans) but also a bigger target. Enhanced senses, better smell but no *Night Vision* special ability. B-Tier. 

-Prongs. A real tank build, high *Survivability* and *Attack Damage* although mostly through *Kick* and *Charge*, not through *Bite*, high speed but unfortunately very little *Stealth* outside the forest biome. Also no special abilities. Not very feasible outside a few situations such as escorting a Werewolf in the forest. D-Tier. 

-The hypothetical Fish Animagus form suggested for the Second Task in GoF. *Mobility* high but locked into one biome, no appendages to do anything so not useful for hostage rescuing, good *Stealth* but only in water, it wouldn't be very useful outside of spying on hot mermaids. Overall pretty shitty build. F-Tier.

From fanfiction:

-Raven Animagus. Amazing *Stealth* since ravens are pretty common in nature, amazing *Mobility*, not many predators so good *Survivability*, decent enough *Attack Damage*, and the perk of communication with natural ravens which are one of the most intelligent, common and easily trained species, so potential army of trained ravens. S-Tier.

-Wolf Animagus. Similar to Padfoot, but significantly worse *Stealth* traded for slightly better *Attack Damage*. Since *Attack Damage* is mostly useless unless it's higher than that of a human wizard, it's overall slightly worse. C-Tier.

-Lion Animagus. Similar to Wolf but even worse *Stealth* and even higher *Attack Damage*. Here *Attack Damage* and *Mobility* are high enough to challenge a wizard, so it's actually feasible to use animal form attacks, but the extremely bad *Stealth* still makes it unfeasible for most situations. C-Tier.

-Snake Animagus. Some *Stealth* but only in certain areas, *Mobility* is decent but nowhere near Raven, *Attack Damage* is good thanks to the *Venom* ability, potential access to the *Parselmouth* ability which allows access to unique areas in Hogwarts. B-Tier.

-Osprey Animagus. Similar to Raven, but less *Stealth* away from the coast, slightly less *Attack Damage* and seabirds aren't as easily trained. Still, great *Mobility*.

Okay, wrong note to start this out on. I am super harry potter obsessed - like almost my entire childhood was just playing the videogames, marathoning the movies every weekend, reading and re-reading the books. I've never met anyone who was as obsessed with HP as I was .....

&amp;#x200B;

Until I found this subreddit. Which was just amazing and eyeopening, and I would really love to get closer with some of you! You don't have to share any personal details like your gender or where you are or even your name, but I'd prefer that you be between 18 - 26 just because I'd feel weird talking to someone a lot older or younger than I am. I'm 21 years old :) 

&amp;#x200B;

If you prefer people who talk less sort of instant-y chat-y type of thing, just stop reading here. If you like long spam, proceed! 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about me before I KO (it's 2 AM here) I am a writer, I love writing, and lately I've been super productive writing too, which is a nice change of pace since i didn't get much done this past year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love cooking, though I'm very 50/50., either it tastes great, or it's fucking terrifying. I love romantic movies, but I also love horrors, and I really love romantic horrors (not really they're almost always horrible haha) but horror comedies are pretty good, and so are some romcoms. I dabble in poetry, 

&amp;#x200B;

My life is pretty boring, but I'm willing to share the mundane parts of it with you if you are - like I bought balsamic vinegar today and I'm super super excited to use it in different stuff and see how it changes things. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we get a lot of people who respond, maybe we could get a group chat or something? Though I'd like to talk to everyone individually first.

Also just send me a direct message! You don't have to comment,

Things in favour of Harry and Ginny:
-they both play the same sport
-she used to have a crush on him
-he saved her in COS 
-theyre both feisty and argumentative when annoyed

Things in favour of Harry and Luna:
-They both experienced death of their family members so they share a connection harry wouldn't share with anyone else
-They both get poorly treated by others in Hogwarts throughout their time there due to people making assumptions about them
-She spends a lot of nice moments alone with harry in the later ones, by saving him at the train in HBP, going to Slughorns party together, when her stuff gets lost at the end of OOTP, tending to the thestrals, etc
-Shes lonely and values her friends more than anything just like Harry
-Ginny is his best friends little sister which I always found a little weird BUT admittedly that's just me 

Basically, Harry only really starts to like Ginny because he finds her attractive in HBP, and I think the connection he could have had with Luna would have been a far better pairing if developed throughout HBP.

573,MCMIVC,1560580941,"Mine (including Fantastic Beasts) are as follows:

**Philosopher's Stone: The Chess Game**  
One of the closest things to a perfect scene in the entire series. Pacing, Music, Production Design, Cinematography, Directing. This is also the scene in the first film where the kid actors are all at their best. Freakin' love this scene!  

*Runner-Up: The scene right after, The man with two faces, has many of the same strentghs as the chess scene, but I think the chess scene is just a little bit better put together.*

**Chamber of Secrets: ....The... Chamber of Secrets.**  
The climax, the snake fight, Tom Riddle. Good shit y'all! Kid-Daniel Radcliffe is so good here (The jump in quality in his acting from film 1 to film 2 is just astronomical), and Christian Coulson just frickin' kills it in this scene as Tom Riddle, so much so that I kinda wish they'd just cast him as Voldemort permanently for the rest of the series.  

*Runner-Up: Lucius Malfoy's introduction in Flourish &amp; Blotts. Such a perfect character introduction. the shade he throws at everyone, perfectly establishing him as the wonderful slimey guy he is.*

**Prisoner of Azkaban: Lupin's Transformation**  
This was the first werewolf transformation scene I saw as a kid. It impacted me so much. The three things that really make this scene are;  
1 - The Cinematography/Lighting. That zoom in to his eyes will stay embedded in my mind forever.  
2 - The Music. John Williams at his A-game as usual, what else can I say?  
3 - David Thewlis and Gary Oldman's acting. Lupin's catatonic and blank stares, and his expressions of pain as his body starts too contort. Sirius desperatly, and sadly futile attepmts of trying to reach his friend.  

*Two Runner-Ups:*  
*1 - Pretty much every scene with Lupin. I love David Thewlis.*  
*2 - Hermione punches Draco. Don't think I need to explain this one.*

**Goblet of Fire: Harry returning with Cedric's body**  
In what I personally think is the least faithfull adaption of the books, this is the one scene I feel they got Spot On. The way all the people are cherring at first and then slowly start to realize the true tragedy that has occured. Patrick Doyle's soundtrack is in general excellent, and it reaches one of it's best climaxes here. All those things are great, but the biggest reason this scene is so brilliant, is Jeff Rawle's as Amos Diggory reacting to his son's death. Just how broken he sounds. His screams of ""MY BOY!"" I get tears in my eyes just thinking about it. Many actors have that one moment that will forever stand as their most iconic/best work. This is surely his. He OWNS that scene.  

*Two Runner-Ups:**  
*1 - Barty Crouch Snr. talking to Harry after the second task. Strange choice, you say? Well; This scene is rather unasuming, and ultimately is mostly just there for Crouch to recognize his son, but his few lines of dialog with Harry before that, talking about grief and loss of a loved one, I found to be rather touching in their subtleness during my last two watchings of the films.*  
*2 - Harry looking at cho and drooling. It's stupid and funny. A+*

**Order of the Phoenix: Harry fighting off Voldemort's Possesion**  
This brilliant climax is a perfect culmination of everything the film has been building towards. Harry's inner battle with Voldemort and/or his inner demons is such a powerfull emotional moment. And his lines of ""You're the one who's weak, and You'll never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for you"" are delivered perfectly by Dan. All the flashbacks to happy times and just... UGHH.... I can't really find the words to describe why I love this scene so much, but I hope I managed to convey some of it.  

*Runner-Up: Every time Imelda Staunton is on screen. She is perfect as Umbridge. So FUCKING detestable and evil. She makes me hate her so much in this film. In my opinion, best individual performance in the ENITRE franchise. (Well, maybe shared with Danf Fogler in Fantastic Beasts) Imelda should have gotten an Oscar for this. I'm dead serious. It's a FUCKING disgrace that she didn't. (Sorry for the multiple F-bombs i this entry, but her performance in this film just boils up so many emotions in me)

**Half-Blood Prince: The battle in the reeds by the Burrow, &amp; Slughorn talking about Francis the fish, and finally giving Harry the memory.**  
&gt; **The battle in the reeds by the Burrow:**  
I simultaniously hate and love this scene.  
Hate it because it wasn't book and shouldn't be able to happen at all and makes no sense. If the death eaters can get to the Burrow that easily, WHY DOESN'T VOLDEMORT HIMSELF GO THERE TO KILL HARRY?!?!?!  
Love it because it is so brilliantly shot and edited and paced. It's a brilliantly tense and at times slightly scary scene, and it stands out because it's so out of place from the rest of the film. So yeah... Hate the scene's placement in the film, love the scene itself.

&gt; **Slughorn talking about Francis the fish, and finally giving Harry the memory**  
See; THIS is the proper way to expand with stuff the wasn't in the book. A beautiful, tragic and touching tale that naturally fits into the narative that already exists. Jim Broadbent is so good in this scene, the pain in his eyes from the memories of Francis and Lily, and this secret he's been keeping for so long seems so real. I have accepted this scene as head-canon for the books as well, it's that good.  

*Runner-Up: The Rest of the Felix Felicies Sequence. I think it's funny, ok?*

**Deathly Hallows, Part 1: Harry and Hermione dance.**  
Beautiful and Bittersweet moment of two teenager stuck in a war, having a brief moment of joy in all the misery. Not really much else to say, it's short and sweet and the sadness when reality sets back in is hauntingly beautiful.  

*Runner-Up: Dobby's Death. Managing to still be sad even after leaving out Dobby from most films. Good Job.*

**Deathly Hallows, Part 2: Courtyard Apocalypse**  
Harry, Ron &amp; Hermione fighting their way towards the boathouse. Spectacular battle scene, brilliant music by Alexandre Desplat. Tense and fast-paced with subtle call-backs to previos adventures. Brilliant.  

*Runner-Up: Seventeen Years Later. Controversial opinion maybe, but I actually really do like the epilogue. Both in book and film. Leaving Hogwarts as the final musical cue in the main series. Brilliant*

**Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to Find Them: Searching for and catching various creatures**  
Not really one single scene, but the best parts of FB was the fun interaction between the four core characters as they made their way through New York, tracking down all the animals. Newt is a different kind of Protagonist, and one we need more of in our media, and him and Tina have such fun and awkwardly cute chemestry. Jacob is just the best, and everyone knows how cute him and Queenie were in the first film. All four played off each other well and they made a really fun team to follow along in an adventure with In my opinion, this is what the FB series should have been like as a whole. Four fun characters going around in various places catching exotic and fantastic beasts, while interacting with each other in funny and cute ways. With the rise of Grindelwald being much more in the background(And I actually really liked Crimes of Grindelwald, but I wish this is how the series had been.)

**Crimes of Grindelwald: Grindelwald's Rally**  
I actually think Johnny Depp is brilliant as Grindelwald, and this scene is where he shines the most Brilliantly seductive and manipulative.

594,stran7mj,1560556245,"During the Quidditch tryouts in HBP, Harry asks McLaggen why he didn’t tryout for keeper the previous year. McLaggen states that he was in the hospital wing after eating a pound of doxy eggs for a bet. This made me think, why would someone eat a pound of doxy eggs and who would even have a pound of dozy eggs at their disposal. Well they first introduced doxies in OOTP when they are cleaning Sirius’s house and we know Fred &amp; George we’re interested in them for their Skiving Snackboxes and after cleaning the curtains with the doxies they collect a bowl of their eggs. Fred &amp; George could have easily nicked those intending to experiment with them for their Skiving Snackboxes. Now a couple motives for the twins to make this bet with McLaggen knowing it’ll most likely make him sick, coincidentally right before keeper tryouts. 

1. They want to prevent him from trying out because they want Ron to be the keeper. 
* Unlikely since I don’t think they knew Ron was trying out for keeper.
2. They want to prevent him from trying out because they don’t like McLaggen and they think he’ll be a cancer on the team, which we see happen in HBP. 
3. They just wanted to mess with McLaggen and make a bit of gold off him thinking he can eat a pound of doxy eggs. 
* Most likely as we are talking about the twins and you know they wouldn’t pass up an opportunity to mess with someone

I believe this because she shared many of the qualities of Credence Barebone (or perhaps Aurelius Dumbledore, if Grindlewald is telling the truth, the brother of Ariana). 

For example, both were believed to be squibs. Credence, who wasn’t accepted by the Quill of Acceptance, (or whatever Ilvermorny use to determine whether they contain enough magic to go to the school). Therefore didn’t have enough magic than required or, Mary Lou hid his letters. 

Ariana was rumoured to be unstable, like Credence was. Also, Bathilda Bagshot claimed she saw Kendra Dumbledore being walked out into the garden holding her hand tightly, as if she is something that needs to be contained, (like an Obscurial). 

She, like Credence, didn’t go to a Hogwarts or Ilvermorny, she was always referenced to as being ill, despite being of a very young age, and as Obscurials do not usually live very long, it could be her dying.

660,Jacob_wallace,1560481416,"There are five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. We know two are good and money. Google gave inconsistent results on the other three, so I guess they haven't been revealed in canon yet. Still, I have theories as to why you can't make food or money. 

For food, well we know you can make things that resemble food. For example, Cedric Diggory turned a rock into a dog for his challenge. Even if you're squeamish about eating dogs, you could presumably make other animals to slaughter for food. 

Except, we know you can't from the line in book 7. So, I suspect that the reason you can't make food is that you can't make something that'll break down properly in a digestive system. Let's say for example, you killed Diggory's rock-dog and tried to eat it. At the cellular level, you'll find it isn't meat. It might even taste like meat. But your body won't be able to break it down for nutrition. It'll likely make you sick, like drinking milk for a lactose intolerant. 

Perhaps if you really, really knew what you were doing and could transform it down to the cellular level, you might could. But that level is rare. That guy using wandless magic and reading Stephen Hawking probably could. 

As for money, this is actually pretty easy. If the wizard society had any sense at all, there's anti-counterfeit principles in place. Like real money. They look like gold coins, but there's magical ways to tell. We just don't know because Harry doesn't have any curiosity. If Hermione was the viewpoint character we would know. You can't transfigure money for the same reason your home printer can't. 

On the flipside, that last one would also cover any holes regarding the exchange fraud between wizard and muggle money. For instance, galleons are worth far less than a muggle gold coin, so you could in theory make mad profit by getting galleons, selling them to muggles, getting muggle money, and then exchanging for galleons for exponential growth. Likely, whatever magic signature prevents counterfeit also prevents them from being given/sold to muggles en masse.",harrypotter,Why you can't make food and money,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c0f1ej/why_you_cant_make_food_and_money/,1560452616.0

\- How does one become a wandmaker? An apprenticeship seems the most likely, but how long does it take?

\- Mr. Ollivander was quite old by the end of the series; did he have a protege who he was training to ultimately take over for him?

676,acerthorn,1560467130,"So the way magic in the HP universe works is ... you say a bunch of gobbledegook, and stuff comes out of your wand.

So how exactly does one go about inventing new spells? Like ... have wizards always had the ability to perform even recently-invented spells, and it was just a matter of discovering what sounds to make with your mouth in order to achieve the desired results? If so, is there some kind of formula that enables wizards to predict what sort of jibberish would be most likely to yield a particular result? Kind of like how chemistry in the real world has a set of principles that enables pharmacists and other medical researchers to predict the effects of new kinds of drugs and other medical treatments they're inventing?

If that's the case, then why are the vast majority of spell incantations so phonetically similar to the English descriptions of their effects? For example, ""protego"" *protects* its caster, ""lumos"" *illuminates* the surrounding area, ""expelliarmus"" *expels* (or gets rid of) your opponent's *arms,* and so on and so forth. Meanwhile, the spell ""point me"" (which Harry uses in the Third Task to make his wand point due north) is entirely in English. Isn't it kind of convenient that the incantations that have existed since the dawn of time, waiting to be discovered by wizards, just happen to sound so much like the language that Harry &amp; friends speak natively?

Or is there some other method to inventing new spells? Do you actually *invent* them, rather than *discover* them? Do the incantations change depending on your native language? If so, why can't wizards just say the magic words in their own language? Protego becomes ""protect me,"" expelliarmus because ""disarm,"" and so on and so forth.

So just how exactly does this work?",harrypotter,"How exactly does one ""invent"" spells?",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c0crem/how_exactly_does_one_invent_spells/,1560438330.0

1. Pensieve memory with Tom Riddles family/mother. Literally the start of it all.
(since his mother could never have ran away to be with Tom Riddle Snr/ used love potion on him, if her dad and brother weren't in Azkaban).

2. No mention of how RAB and Kreacher found out Voldemorts secret. I loved that part of the book.

3. No mention of the house Elfs Union - SPEW or that Dobby was living/working in Hogwarts.

4. No background on Tom Riddle working at a Borgin and Borkes - or how he came into possession of each Hogwarts house item.

5. No details on Dumbledores family, they completely forgot to finish that plot line in the movies. 

6. Most infuriating.... Harry using Crucio curse on Amycus Carrow - because he spat on McGonagall

740,Melusinahp,1560415078,"Cursed Child 100% acknowledges the wonderful person Cedric was in the main timeline. Harry gives a whole speech about it. But it also acknowledges that no one is immune from the effects of trauma. It’s easy to be a wonderful person when you’re handsome, smart, talented, popular and well-loved by all. When those things you’ve taken for granted are taken away, however, a person can change.

Cedric had to be the character Albus went back for. It couldn't have been any other character. Albus had to go back for a son who’d been lost to his father. He had to go back for “the spare”, because he felt himself to be the spare. And because he, wrongly, didn’t believe that his father loved him. By going back to rescue Cedric, he was going back to save himself. To prove to his own father that he could be heroic too and thus worthy of love, and to prove that to himself. 

JKR doesn’t deal in incorruptible characters. Even her heroes are flawed, intentionally so, to show that they’re human. To show that we have to fight to be good people. It’s not easy. Cedric isn’t immune from that. What happens to him in the alternative timeline isn’t comparable to “Weasley is our King”. It’s not a temporary humiliation limited to Hogwarts. Cedric is humiliated in a way that would be in the *Prophet*, that would be talked about through the entire wizarding world. It would be in the history books. He’d be the boy who floated out of the Tri-Wizard Tournament for the rest of his life. And given the butterfly effect concept of the storyline, it’s clear that his Tri-Wizard humiliation is only the first step towards his becoming a Death Eater. 

The fact that Cedric goes dark is tied directly into other themes of the play which tie into the themes of the whole HP series: love gives you the strength to be brave enough to make good ethical choices. It IS easy to be a good person when everyone loves you. It makes you super strong. But we saw in the books how much pride Amos had in Cedric’s successes. How he bragged about him to the point that Cedric was embarrassed. How would Amos respond to a son who was suddenly a public joke rather than a golden boy? We don’t know, but we can imagine. So it’s *possible* that after his humiliation, Cedric felt rejected and alone for the first time in his life. It’s possible that that made him vulnerable. And it’s possible that people on the lookout could have taken advantage of that and radicalised him. We don’t get that story in the play. It’s not needed. But we can easily imagine it for ourselves.

Draco talks about how feeling alone drove him to a dark place. He warned Harry that without his father and without his best friend–without love and support–Albus was set on a path to darkness. 

The whole point about the alternative worlds is that they *weren’t right*. Things had gone horribly wrong. They were possible but warped versions of the world and they didn’t last. 

So, I totally get *not liking* Cedric’s storyline, but I don’t agree that it’s not a possible or thematically strong storyline. ",harrypotter,Cedric's storyline in Cursed Child works if you understand the HP series.,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/c03aby/cedrics_storyline_in_cursed_child_works_if_you/,1560386278.0

I’ve always wanted a Harry Potter tattoo, because for many years i’ve been in love with the books. I know many people get the deathly hallows, but I just don’t connect with that story as much. I fell in love with Snape’s character. I love the idea that every day, we can choose a path different from the one we were on yesterday. I love that even though Snape was a death eater, Dumbledore trusted him entirely. That he came from a bad background and ended a hero. I had a rough childhood and think it would be a good reminder that my past does not define me, and that I can grow from it every day. I’m struggling with this, because it seems to be a popular opinion that the dark mark is a symbolism of “nazis” or “supremacists.” I am happy to explain its meaning to those who ask, but am scared it will scare away people.

I mean I can't be surprised, seeing as that's what most of her screentime (or papertime) is unfortunately dedicated to, but she was brave enough to fight in the Battle Of Hogwarts, despite being well aware that she could die at any moment. That's the mark of a true Gryffindor, right there. In fact, it's still debated if she did survive or not.

But beyond that, I get the impression that she's just really **really** nice. I know some people almost instinctively see her as a mean girl stereotype, but I always liked how in the background, she kept looking out for Trelawney. And even though Ron found her a bit much to handle, she probably did more good for his self esteem than anyone else did at that point. 

It just seems unfair to me that she's so heavily slammed by some people for being in love. Besides, she may be over the top, but she's so endearing that I can't help but smile whenever she shows up. Quadruply so in the HBP movie, because Jessie Cave's performance simply couldn't be any cuter.

793,CTRL_ALT_PWN,1560359855,"I wanted to write about one very real and engaging topic from the play.  To be clear, I actually loved it a lot and don't see any gaping plot holes as to why this can't be canon.  Not the point here, save your comments for another time.  

The point I am writing about is how real adult Harry was.  His emotions, development, and approach to difficulties of adulthood were real, engaging, and made sense to his background.  This may not be as coherent as I would like.  I may also pepper in some developments of other characters.

1. Harry was a loving father when it as easy.  The train scene.  He encourages Albus and sends him off to Hogwarts.  Very typical of parents.

2. Harry has trouble being a dad, never knowing his.  The play puts emphasis on this.  In the play, he turns to Dumbledore's painting, which doesn't seem to help much. This is believable knowing Harry's background.  He never knew James, and only had a few years with Sirius and Remus.   

3. Harry uses his power incorrectly to enforce his will.  He commands Albus not to see Scorpius when he thinks Scorpius is dangerous and when they refuse, he demands that Headmistress Mcgonagall keep them apart, threatening to use his power at the Ministry to shut down Hogwarts.  At first, this seems so unlike Harry, but when you step back, this seems like something a father would do; force things to go his way.  This was a powerful scene for me.  It shows Harry's desperation and lack of wisdom in fixing problem.  It shows gaps in his character that you don't often get in the 7 books.  

4. Harry says that he sometimes wishes Albus wasn't his son.  Huge point in the play.  It was hinted but never spoken.  Then eventually Harry admits it.  I don't think this happens often in families, but every parent has to have moments where they wish their child was different, especially when there is another child meeting all expectations.  In this case, James and Lily are what Harry wants.  Albus is different, and Harry doesn't know what to do.  Things came so naturally for him.  Again, this shows Harry's humanity and I loved it so much.  The play dealt with real human emotions.

5.  I thought Draco's development was cool too.  The scene where they duel in Harry's kitchen.  Obviously, it was fun to see how little things changed.  But then they have a real conversation where Draco reveals how he was always jealous of the Harry, Ron, Hermione group.  All the animosity between Harry and Draco started so early, when they were 11-years old.  And things spiraled.  Considering how the Malfoys left Voldemort for real in the end, Draco's development in helping Harry now is a believable and welcomed development.  

I have many other thoughts and really did enjoy this play.  If you all like this, maybe I'll type up some more.",harrypotter,In defense of The Cursed Child,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bztxek/in_defense_of_the_cursed_child/,1560331055.0

What was wrong with telling Harry why she didn’t think the broom was safe? It couldn’t been hard to say “Harry, I think that broom may have been sent by Sirius Black with a curse placed on it to kill you. Before riding it I think we should have some of the professors take a look at it just to be safe.” If Harry resisted, Hermione could’ve reminded him that someone namely Quirrell actually did try to kill him with a broom in his first year. It’s not like the broom would remain a secret for long anyway since the school would know Harry had a Firebolt once the next Quidditch match started so why not make sure the broom was jinx free in the meantime. Hermione doesn’t go to McGonagall for right away and spends quite some time with Harry and Ron with the broom so she had opportunities to inform them so it doesn’t make sense why she wouldn’t?

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here already talked about the fact that there is NO WAY that Voldemort ever would have fathered a child?  And especially not with Belatrix Lestrange?  It is absolutely impossible that Delphi was his daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Voldemort thought his Horcruxes would give him immortality.  He always planned to be around forever, so he would have had no use for an heir to carry on his lineage.  He was going to carry on his own lineage - forever.  Voldemort would have considered it a pathetic admission of weakness to produce a child, because it would have implied that Voldemort had considered the possibility that he-himself might not be there and might need someone else ""to finish the job for him"" the way that Slytherin expected a future heir of Slytherin to come back and open the Chamber of Secrets.  

&amp;#x200B;

The long winded version:

&amp;#x200B;

What we know from cannon: 

1) Voldemort had no ability to love or to understand love.  

2) Voldemort became less human and more snake-like as he created more Horcruxes.  

3) Voldemort was a powerful wizard with the ability to magically achieve his goals.  

4) Voldemort believed that he was the greatest wizard of all time 

5) Voldemort had no friends, even among his followers.  He enjoyed using his power to demonstrate his dominance or to torture or stoke fear in others, even his followers and underlings, and took pleasure in watching them squirm.

6) Voldemort intended for his Horcruxes to provide him with immortality    

&amp;#x200B;

What this means:

&amp;#x200B;

A)   It is highly unlikely that Voldemort would have engaged in the sexual act to create a child.  Only one rationale exists for the sexual act itself.

1)  He had no ability to love Belatrix and would not have had sex with her out of intimacy or tenderness.

2) Because he was no longer fully human and was only interested in power, he likely would not have felt a need for the physical gratification of the sexual act.  So he would not have had sex for the sake of sexual pleasure.

5) He might have considered forcing one of his Death Eaters to have sex with him (even might have raped someone) if he perceived it to be a display of dominance and power - if the sexual act was forcing his will on an unwilling participant.  But in that case, he never would have chosen Belatrix.  Even though she was married, she clearly lusted after Voldemort.  SHE would have desired the sexual contact, and as such, he a sexual act with her would have not fulfilled HIS desire to use the sex as a dominance desplay of forcing his will on someone else.   

5) The only way he might have had sex with Belatrix is if he saw the cuckolding of Rudolphus Lestrange as a desirable deplay of his power.

&amp;#x200B;

B) So let's assume the unlikely scenario that Voldemort decided that cuckolding Rudophus Lestrange would be a desirable dominance display.  Voldemort still would have never fathered a child.

3) He was a powerful wizard.  He easily could have created a jinx that could block his sperm from contacting Belatrix's egg.  So he could have used magical birth control to prevent her from becomming pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

C) So he COULD use magical birth control.  Does that mean he WOULD use magical birth control?  Absolutely he would!

1) He had no love and no desire to love/raise/teach a child.  He hated all children, especially young crying babies from his time in the orphanage.

4)  Since Voldemort was the greatest wizard of all time and thrived on the power and on being considered the ""best"", he would have had no desire for a ""mini-me"" who could conceivably grow up and claim the mantle of being powerful, ""just like my dad.""

6)  And this is the heart of my argument: Voldemort thought his Horcruxes would give him immortality.  He always planned to be around forever, so he would have had no use for an heir to carry on his lineage.  He was going to carry on his own lineage - forever.  Voldemort would have considered it a pathetic admission of weakness to produce a child, because it would have implied that Voldemort had considered the possibility that he-himself might not be there and might need someone else ""to finish the job for him"" the way that Slytherin expected a future heir of Slytherin to come back and open the Chamber of Secrets.",harrypotter,The Cursed Child Cannot be Cannon,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bzln6g/the_cursed_child_cannot_be_cannon/,1560278154.0

827,TheMentalist10,1560296642,"I just finished re-reading Half-Blood Prince for the first time since I finished it as a kid in 2005. I tend to see Dobby, Hedwig, Tonks/Lupin considered as the hardest-hitting deaths, but I will never forget sitting on a beach on a family holiday trying to follow the shade around as I devoured the book and the utter, hollow devastation I felt at Dumbledore's death. It all came flooding back tonight.

One of the things I think JKR does really well with this death is to capture the sense of extinguished potential. The moment where Harry really understands the magnitude of his final mentor's passing comes just after it occurs to him that he never asked Dumbledore the relatively mundane question of how he learnt to speak to the Merpeople. And that now he'll never be able to.

It got me thinking about what Dumbledore could or should have done to foresee the way in which his own death would impact Harry, not just emotionally, but with specific regards to the task that lies before him. Obviously, the whole year plays out as a kind of *Riddle 101* with Dumbledore keen to emphasise that understanding (even empathising with) Voldemort is key to defeating him. But it feels like he leaves a lot to chance in terms of the practicalities of the mission.

1. Do you think Dumbledore anticipated dying on the night that he did? Given that retrieving the ring almost killed him, surely he recognised that there was a decent chance this could be the end?
2. Knowing the extremity of the danger, is bringing Harry along to witness what is at best likely to be a near-death experience in The Cave an attempt at a kind of baptism of fire in the horcrux destruction department? I think this is interesting, because Harry's chief takeaway from the experience is that he doesn't understand pretty much any aspect of what Dumbledore does to locate the locket; surely this would be more disheartening than encouragin?
3. If he hadn't died that night, what more do you think Dumbledore would have done to prepare Harry in the time he had remaining?

Harry being able to listen to the Marauder’s conversation when Snape hadn’t heard it himself seems a little unrealistic. I would prefer that you could only hear exactly what the memory holder had. 

Also, I like the way the Pensieve shows all of the surroundings but I think those surroundings should be created only from memory since the memory holder couldn’t possibly know what was going on 360 degrees around him/her. 

For example, if a bird was chirping behind the memory holder’s head, you would see a bird there but you wouldn’t know if that was how the bird actually looked because it was simply created by the memory holder’s idea of a bird.",harrypotter,Laws of the Wizarding World You Wish Existed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bzjs2r/laws_of_the_wizarding_world_you_wish_existed/,1560266947.0

1. Fred and George Weasley. 

There wasnt any characters like them in the entire series, and they didnt get given as much to do as others and that was a shame.


2. Bellatrix Lestrange.

She was the best written villain of Harry Potter, and Helena Bonham Carter did the damn thing and I loved it.


3. Draco Malfoy.

As the series progressed, especially HBP, Draco as a character developed so much, but it went nowhere after that. He was shown to be a product of his father's discipline, and deep down he wasnt a horrible person, and redemption was always there and I will forever hate whoever made the decision to cut the scene with him in DH2.


4. Alastor Moody.

Considering a lot of his character was *played* by Barty Jr, it would have been interesting to see the real Moody more than what we got. 


5. Horace Slughorn.

I only wanted a little bit more from Slughorn as he wasnt really a favourite character of mine. I wish him and Voldemort had one final scene together after what was shown in his memories. Along with Slughorns death.

845,Stopitimtired,1560279844,"Reasons why he's one of my favorite characters: 

1- He can't hear you, he's asleep. 

""When the clever-looking wizard continued to sleep, some of them shouted his name too."" 

""We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts! Shame on you, Phineas!"" - Dippet's portrait to a sleepy Phineas. 

2- He ~~probably~~ prefers being dead over dealing with ""young people"". 

He was the least popular Headmaster because he didn't want to be one since he *can't* handle students. ~~He also said what we were sometimes thinking.~~ 

""Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own-""   
""You know, this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet lead you into harm? No. No, like all you young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only clever enough to realize \[...\]"" 

""Now if you'll excuse me, I have better thing to do than listening to adolescent agonizing... good day to you."" 

From Hogwarts Mystery, ""Don't wave at me, you little troll."" 

3- He somewhat cares. 

Before Sirius died:

""Probably another message for my worthless great-great-grandson.""

After Sirius died: 

""Am I to understand \[...\] that my great-great-grandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead?"" 

""He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait calling for Sirius throughout the house."" 

4- ""You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts... but you cannot deny he's got style..."" 

5- He played a significant part in saving the wizarding world by helping the trio and informing Snape of their steps. 

6- He actually changed his mindset eventually and was proud that Slytherins (some of them pure blood fanatics) helped defeat Voldemort. 

But that is all I have, you poor puffed-up popinjays!",harrypotter,Phineas Black has too much snark and no time for your angst,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bzgp8r/phineas_black_has_too_much_snark_and_no_time_for/,1560251044.0
846,fletcherscotta,1560276408,"If Voldemort literally split his soul in half each time he made a Horcrux each would have a different amount of his soul in it. The math works out to:

* Diary:    1/2 50%
* Ring:     1/4 25%
* Locket:  1/8 12.5%
* Cup:      1/16 6.3%
* Diadem: 1/32 3.1%
* Harry:    1/64 1.6%
* Nagini:   1/128 0.8%

I think that amount of soul contained pretty well matches the power of each horcrux. Tom's diary is the strongest in the books, and the ring was powerful enough to curse Dumbledore to eventual death.  The locket made Ron leave his girlfriend and best friend. We don't spend a lot of time with the Cup and Diadem but no powers are specifically mentioned.

849,Redross_91,1560272353,"This post is inspired by a comment I made in another post about Dumbledore hiring Moody as a teacher. But it made me think a bit more about it, and I can only conclude that Dumbledore was an absolutely terrible teacher. Here's why, and I'll start off with some of the people he hired:

* Moody: Magical eye and can see through the kids' clothes. Known to be a bit crazy and a drunk (evident by it being seemingly completely normal that he drank out of a hip-flask all the time).

* Lupin: Werewolf. Although he's a good guy, his condition is downright dangerous. And in PoA him forgetting to take his potion puts three students and a teacher in huge danger. He could have killed them all.

* Hagrid: Completely unqualified to be a teacher, hasn't even completed school. On his first day teaching, he shows the class hippogriffs which are highly dangerous and known to be violent, and a student is attacked. Obviously has no regard for how dangerous some animals are to people who aren't half-giants.

* Trelawney: Although she is a seer, she doesn't know it herself, and is completely incapable of teaching her powers to others. Also an alcoholic who is drunk around the students regularly.

* Lockhart: Here Dumbledore simply sacrificed a year of his students' education because he wanted to expose an author to be a fraud. What the fuck.

* Snape: A very recent member of a a supremacist group known for torturing and murdering. Only hired because Dumbledore needed him for his own personal agenda.

* Quirrell: Not as much Dumbledore's fault for hiring him, but more so for allowing him to carry on after Dumbledore knew that he was working for Voldemort.


Here Dumbledore time and time again either hires people for his own personal interests, or because they are his friends. In many cases he shows complete disregard to the students' education, and would rather hire completely unqualified, incompetent or dangerous people as long as it benefits him or they are his friend.

On to some other downright questionable decisions he made:

* The Philosopher's Stone's protection and allowing Harry to attempt to retrieve it. This is just completely ludicrous all over. The protection was easily broken by three 11 year olds (although they had help with the troll). Allowing Harry to risk his life was extremely stupid and very nearly lead to his death.

* Allowing Malfoy to keep on trying to kill him, even though his attempts had very nearly killed two innocent students, both of whom only escaped death through sheer luck. 

* Allowing the school to stay open even though there was a huge snake slithering around petrifying students. Again, almost lead to multiple deaths of innocent kids.

Issue: The artist put in the deathly hallows symbol, but as you can see, it’s elongated.  But it’s tall and skinny which is perfect for a champagne glass. Do you think it’s a big deal if the symbol is elongated like that? Does the book reference it to being a perfect triangle with even sides? Or should I go with the second option..?

878,insufferablknowitall,1560246338,"If you're Voldemort trying to make a plan to hide your horcruxes prior to Trelawney's first prophecy there are two people/types of people you should be most concerned about finding and destroying them: Dumbledore or some rival dark wizard.

Voldemort is reasonably good at creating defenses that would stop someone like him from taking his horcruxes, though those defenses weren't quite as brilliant as Dumbledore using the Mirror of Erised to guard the Philosopher's Stone. Still, someone strongly motivated by greed/envy would have likely been bested by the Locket. And while we don't get to see the specific defenses/curses put up by the Ring and Cup, I think it's reasonable to infer that they might have been guarded similarly (the ring was set with some sort of powerful dark magic, and I just imagine the cup as being very in line with idea of tempting the greedy though I admit these are mostly head-cannon). But all of the other five horcruxes are really lacking in the ability to put up any significant defense (besides the Diary and Locket being parsel-tougne dependent) against Dumbledore.

So in order to figure out what sort of defense might work best against Dumbledore, we need to ask what strengths of Dumbledore's make him so good at finding and destroying horcruxes. Here's my shortlist:

1) Dumbledore is an incredibly skilled wizard who can overcome basically any defense that can be surmounted just by being good at magic.

2) While Dumbledore isn't free of human faults (as his mistake with the Ring proved), he's not so easily tempted by the dark arts to be likely to fall for the kind of defense the Locket put up, where the aim is to lure the person into abandoning the attempt to destroy it or become possessed by it.

3) Dumbledore knows a lot about Tom Riddle and has made a point of keeping an ""annoyingly close watch on him"" since Tom was a young boy.

4) Dumbledore has the magical prowess, critical thinking skills, and knowledge of how Tom Riddle operates to feel out the ""traces"" of his magic. This is how he navigated his way through the cave, and very likely the Gaunt shack as well.

Based on this analysis, we can draw some inferences about what would/wouldn't be useful in hiding a horcrux from Dumbledore:

1) Complicated spells aren't that useful.

2) Dark magic alone is insufficient.

3) The location, choice of object, etc should be maximally random, and avoid as much connection to things of personal significance to Voldemort as possible.

4) Complex/powerful magic is actively detrimental because it will do more to lead Dumbledore to the right place/object than to protect the horcrux.

In other words, the defense I think would be maximally effective against Dumbledore is functionally a needle in a haystack. It dismisses the fancy defenses we can infer don't work, and in doing so minimizes the personal stylistic elements, ego stroking, and personal operating styles that Dumbledore relies on knowing in order to predict what Voldemort will do. By using *just* enough magic to guard against ridiculously simple ploys like summoning the horcrux, you'd close off any real ability to use magic, wit, or critical thinking to find it, and force Dumbledore to rely solely on chance.

Of course, Voldemort is too egotistical, arrogant, and self important to literally use a needle in a haystack, a random piece of garbage in the middle of the ocean, or similar. But the Diadem is a surprisingly worthy candidate for a substitute:

- The choice of the diadem is admittedly imperfect as it's a very magically powerful and historically important object. However as it's been lost for a thousand plus years and only one ghost could possibly tie it to Voldemort, it's actually harder than it might seem to connect it to Voldemort (unlike the Ring, Locket, and Cup, for which Voldemort had to leave deaths, witnesses, and clear ties to parts of his past that Dumbledore could dig up).

- As much as the diadem is a precious tiara, it's not that difficult to overlook in the right context - as evidenced by Harry picking it up and moving it without a second thought. It's just a ""battered old tiara.""

- It's using the Room of Requirement that's a truly inspired move. The place where things are hidden is basically the definition of a ""haystack,"" and even when the Golden Trio returns knowing exactly what they're looking for it's hard to find just because of the sheer volume of stuff in there. Can't be summoned/charmed into showing up, but is otherwise just as innocuous as anything else there, and able to hide in plain sight.

- Hogwarts is a great hiding place in part because there's so much magic all over that the bare minimum charms used to make the Diadem impossible to summon/charm/etc wouldn't stand out in the slightest.

- The Diadem is in a part of the castle that's used by just enough people such that if someone stumbles across the Room of Requirement they don't immediately think ""this place it strange, there must be powerful dark magic here,"" but not so well known that anyone would be likely to find or disturb the horcrux by accident.

- The Room is the kind of thing that's much more likely to be found by trouble makers, like Riddle, Harry, and the Weasley twins - a goodie two shoes like Dumbledore is much less likely to come across it (and when he did by accident he was more concerned with chamber pots than looking for signs of dark magic)

- The Room is already charmed to put up protections for its items on request. The reason it didn't open for Harry's requests of ""I need to know what Malfoy is up to"" is some combination of that kind of request not being specific enough and Malfoy probably having asked the Room to protect his work from being disturbed. Because the mechanics of the space already take care of these details without Voldemort having to implement the same functionality, he can avoid leaving those ""traces"" of his magical style, or any magic that looks out of place with the rest of the castle, that might have alerted Dumbledore to Voldemort having done anything there.

What I find really impressive isn't just that the Diadem is a good needle in a haystack, but it's a needle in a haystack that simultaneously strokes Voldemort's ego. He didn't just find a place to hide a horcrux Dumbledore wouldn't be able to find - he hid an ancient Hogwarts founders' object **in the place he was closest to considering his home, right under the crooked nose of the one man everyone said he feared above all others, and Dumbledore went his entire life without finding it.**",harrypotter,Ravenclaw's Diadem was the Best Hidden Horcrux,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bzaf5y/ravenclaws_diadem_was_the_best_hidden_horcrux/,1560217538.0

Note, I love them all, and it was so hard to rank them by movie (by my level of enjoyment). It changes every day. Alas, here they are:

&amp;#x200B;

**Philosopher's Stone:**

1. Leaving Hogwarts
2. Hedwig's Theme
3. Harry's Wondrous World
4. Prologue
5. Arrival of Baby Harry
6. The Quidditch Match
7. The Invisibility Cloak
8. Visit to the Zoo and Letters from Hogwarts
9. Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters and the Journey to Hogwarts
10. Christmas at Hogwarts
11. Diagon Alley and the Gringotts Vault
12. Mr. Longbottom Flies
13. Hogwarts Forever! and the Moving Stairs
14. The Face of Voldemort

So, you're probably wondering why I included 14 of the 19 on the soundtrack. It was hard to omit things in the first place! All the music in this movie is just so iconic. I thought that I had the right order, and then I would come across another one of my favourites! Agh! So difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamber of Secrets**

1. Fawkes the Phoenix and Fawkes is Reborn
2. Gilderoy Lockhart
3. Reunion of Friends
4. Prologue: Book II and the Escape from the Dursleys
5. The Chamber of Secrets
6. The Flying Car
7. Polyjuice Potion
8. Meeting Aragog
9. The Spiders

A lot of the music here was recycled, John Williams was quite busy at the time. However, the newer additions are some of the best. Fawkes the Phoenix is majestic, beautiful. Probably one of the best pieces I've ever heard! Reunion of Friends, similar to Leaving Hogwarts, never fails to make me cry! Oh, and Gilderoy Lockhart is amusic and really fits the character.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prisoner of Azkaban**

1. Buckbeak's Flight tied with Mischief Manage (the ending medley)
2. A Window to the Past
3. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight
4. Secrets of the Castle
5. Forward to Time Past
6. Hagrid the Professor
7. The Portrait Gallery
8. Aunt Marge's Waltz
9. The Knight Bus
10. The Werewolf Scene
11. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers
12. The Patronus Light

Yeah. A lot of the best music is on here. Buckbeak's Flight is one of the best John Williams ever composed, like wow. A Window to the Past is relaxing as heck, and the rest are so iconic. It's probably my favourite soundtrack of the lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goblet of Fire**

1. Harry in Winter
2. Potter Waltz
3. Death of Cedric
4. Rita Skeeter
5. The Story Continues
6. Neville's Waltz
7. The Quidditch World Cup
8. The Black Lake
9. The Dark Mark
10. Sirius Fire
11. Hogwarts March
12. Foreign Visitors Arrive

The most underrated soundtrack of all time IMO. I didn't use to like it, I always thought it was pretty forgettable. That was, until, I gave it a relisten on its own. Wow, Harry in Winter is fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Order of the Phoenix**

1. Professor Umbridge and Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning
2. Ministry of Magic
3. Fireworks
4. Flight of the Order of the Phoenix
5. The Room of Requirements
6. Possession
7. Dumbledore's Army
8. Loved Ones and Leaving
9. Death of Sirius
10. A Journey to Hogwarts
11. Another Story

I just saw this in concert, and it sounded beautiful. The Ministry of Magic is just so creative, and Professor Umbridge is just so damn catchy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Half-Blood Prince**

I do not have the soundtrack for this film :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Deathly Hallows Part 1**

I do not have the soundtrack for this film :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Deathly Hallows Part 2**

1. Courtyard Apocalypse and Statues
2. Lily's Theme
3. Voldemort's End
4. A New Beginning
5. Battlefield
6. Snape's Demise

My least favourite soundtrack, but I love Courtyard Apocalypse!

&amp;#x200B;

**Top Ten of All Time**

1. Buckbeak's Flight
2. Fawkes the Phoenix
3. Leaving Hogwarts
4. Hedwig's Theme
5. Harry's Wondrous World
6. Harry in Winter
7. Courtyard Apocalypse
8. Professor Umbridge

898,Wither_Fire,1560219571,"I love listening to them on a regular basis (when I'm walking home from school or walking the dog, etc.). So, I have compiled my favourites! Note, I love them all, and it was so hard to rank them by movie (by my level of enjoyment). It changes every day. Alas, here they are:

&amp;#x200B;

**Philosopher's Stone:**

1. Leaving Hogwarts
2. Hedwig's Theme
3. Harry's Wondrous World
4. Prologue
5. Arrival of Baby Harry
6. The Quidditch Match
7. The Invisibility Cloak
8. Visit to the Zoo and Letters from Hogwarts
9. Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters and the Journey to Hogwarts
10. Christmas at Hogwarts
11. Diagon Alley and the Gringotts Vault
12. Mr. Longbottom Flies
13. Hogwarts Forever! and the Moving Stairs
14. The Face of Voldemort

So, you're probably wondering why I included 14 of the 19 on the soundtrack. It was hard to omit things in the first place! All the music in this movie is just so iconic. I thought that I had the right order, and then I would come across another one of my favourites! Agh! So difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamber of Secrets**

1. Fawkes the Phoenix and Fawkes is Reborn
2. Gilderoy Lockhart
3. Reunion of Friends
4. Prologue: Book II and the Escape from the Dursleys
5. The Chamber of Secrets
6. The Flying Car
7. Polyjuice Potion
8. Meeting Aragog
9. The Spiders

A lot of the music here was recycled, John Williams was quite busy at the time. However, the newer additions are some of the best. Fawkes the Phoenix is majestic, beautiful. Probably one of the best pieces I've ever heard! Reunion of Friends, similar to Leaving Hogwarts, never fails to make me cry! Oh, and Gilderoy Lockhart is amusic and really fits the character.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prisoner of Azkaban**

1. Buckbeak's Flight tied with Mischief Manage (the ending medley)
2. A Window to the Past
3. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight
4. Secrets of the Castle
5. Forward to Time Past
6. Hagrid the Professor
7. The Portrait Gallery
8. Aunt Marge's Waltz
9. The Knight Bus
10. The Werewolf Scene
11. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers
12. The Patronus Light

Yeah. A lot of the best music is on here. Buckbeak's Flight is one of the best John Williams ever composed, like wow. A Window to the Past is relaxing as heck, and the rest are so iconic. It's probably my favourite soundtrack of the lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goblet of Fire**

1. Harry in Winter
2. Potter Waltz
3. Death of Cedric
4. Rita Skeeter
5. The Story Continues
6. Neville's Waltz
7. The Quidditch World Cup
8. The Black Lake
9. The Dark Mark
10. Sirius Fire
11. Hogwarts March
12. Foreign Visitors Arrive

The most underrated soundtrack of all time IMO. I didn't use to like it, I always thought it was pretty forgettable. That was, until, I gave it a relisten on its own. Wow, Harry in Winter is fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Order of the Phoenix**

1. Professor Umbridge and Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning
2. Ministry of Magic
3. Fireworks
4. Flight of the Order of the Phoenix
5. The Room of Requirements
6. Possession
7. Dumbledore's Army
8. Loved Ones and Leaving
9. Death of Sirius
10. A Journey to Hogwarts
11. Another Story

I just saw this in concert, and it sounded beautiful. The Ministry of Magic is just so creative, and Professor Umbridge is just so damn catchy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Half-Blood Prince**

I do not have the soundtrack for this film :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Deathly Hallows Part 1**

I do not have the soundtrack for this film :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Deathly Hallows Part 2**

1. Courtyard Apocalypse and Statues
2. Lily's Theme
3. Voldemort's End
4. A New Beginning
5. Battlefield
6. Snape's Demise

My least favourite soundtrack, but I love Courtyard Apocalypse!

&amp;#x200B;

**Top Ten of All Time**

1. Buckbeak's Flight
2. Fawkes the Phoenix
3. Leaving Hogwarts
4. Hedwig's Theme
5. Harry's Wondrous World
6. Harry in Winter
7. Courtyard Apocalypse
8. Professor Umbridge
9. Gilderoy Lockhart

906,YourDailyDevil,1560214809,"I had this conversation earlier and am curious what people think. In my own beliefs, it’s 

1) Kreacher, which is an exceptional example of a B character with his own perfect little arc that not only stays true to the themes of the story throughout, but is also entertaining to read. Also his ending, literally leading the house elves in the battle of hogwarts, is truly satisfying.

2) Horace Slughorn. As much as I love the earlier books in their own way, it does occasionally fall back on some pretty blunt “good vs evil” characterization, and it was refreshing and interesting to see a character that wasn’t truly good, but most certainly wasn’t evil. He had a distinct personality that whether you liked him or hated him was still engrossing, and was very much something we hadn’t seen before in the series.

Quite curious to see what everyone else thinks deserves more credit.

911,FullofSeoul,1560207590,"So I know the title makes absolutely no sense at first, but bear with me here. This has been bothering me for a while.

So Pottermore, a couple months ago, tweeted that wizards, back in the days of old, ""wizards simply relieved themselves where they stood and vanished the evidence.""

I'm sure you all heard it. It was, after all, crucial information in building the Wizarding World's canon.

So how does this relate to Hogwarts? Well, according to Pottermore, Hogwarts was founded some time in the 10th century, well before the advent of modern plumbing in the late 18th century. Pottermore states that modern plumbing wasn't implemented until muggles invented it, which means it's unlikely the Founders were ahead of their time in that particular regard.

This means that the girl's restroom which houses the Chamber was either 
A. Originally a girl's bathroom (Slytherin, you dog), and later renovated to add sinks and toilets and the like. Or.
B. Not a bathroom at all and made into one at a later date with sinks and toilets and the like.

Seeing as the basilisk ran through pipes hidden throughout the school, I find it difficult to believe that anybody or any crew could renovate and tear apart an entire room without finding the Chamber beforehand. 

So what gives? 

If wizards doodoo'ed on the floor, how did the chamber remain secret?? These are the hard hitting questions that need answering!

P.S.
I like to imagine a magical construction crew of exclusively parselmouths (preferably named Parselmouth Plumbers) that discovered the Chamber and never told anybody. And maybe one of them carved that little snake on the sink.

Or, y'know, Wizards didn't poopookaka on the floor.

918,Syoung24,1560202823,"I recently re-read the entire series after a few years. It was the first time I re-read the entire thing since high school. I think one of the most amazing things about the series is that you can take something new out of them each time you read them, depending on where you are at in life. I have grown a lot and read the books with a different perspective and that changed my view point on a lot of characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Sirius Black used to be my absolute favorite character growing up. I loved him and the relationship he built with Harry so, so much . After re-reading I felt that he was much more selfish, impulsive, and irrational than I had previously assessed --- He therefore fell in my power rankings. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I really came to appreciate both Harry and Hermione more. Harry, I felt, was a much more nuanced, intelligent, and kind character than i had originally given him credit for being. Hermione, I truthfully used to be annoyed at, but she really kicks ass the entire series and is such a power house. She is often the voice of reason, and has a maturity beyond her years.

The Snape twist was incredibly executed by Alan Rickman’s acting. Everything he did was to protect Harry out of his love for Lily. You can really feel the pain and despair Snape has felt throughout his life— never getting to be with the woman he loved. 

There’s just so many raw human emotions that go into this. The realization Harry has that he’s lived his whole life figuring out the mystery of his childhood and now he needs to die for the greater good.

I would teach Charms or Transfiguration. Mostly because ""flying"" doesn't seem as prodigious as the other core subjects, and because DADA seems much more dangerous and chaotic given you're probably going to be dueling people at some point.

**Maybe interesting:** potions, care of magical creatures, ancient runes. *(Because I love animals and foreign languages. I'm unsure about potions. I'm not a fan of cooking, but Potions are really useful and might be more interesting than cooking.)*

Harry escapes Malfoy Manor in DH by disarming Draco. from this point on he is the master of the Elder Wand. 

now the penultimate part of DH is when Harry realises his destiny was always to die and that that was Dumbledore’s plan the whole time. he truly accepts his death. voldemort subsequently “kills” him.

later on when he comes back Harry explains that *he* is the true master of the Elder Wand to Voldemort. when Voldemort makes another attempt at killing him, the curse rebounds because *the wand will not kill its own master*.

question is...harry has been master of the Elder Wand from BEFORE the point Voldemort “kills” him in the forest. voldemort also uses the Elder Wand while doing so. so why didn’t the curse rebound THEN instead of at the very end?

this has really been bothering me lately. i would of course like to hear your thoughts but so far these are the two explanations i have come up with. 

*harry’s soul had part of Voldemort’s soul in it. so that meant he fully wasn’t it’s owner yet. as in, part of soul just wasn’t the true master. 

*the most likely one. harry was *willing to die*. he did not defend himself, he simply accepts that he has to die for Voldemort to be killed. even wand magic does not apply in these situations.

can see a few loopholes in these so would love to hear your thoughts and explanations.",harrypotter,Why did he die? [Deathly Hallows spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bymre0/why_did_he_die_deathly_hallows_spoilers/,1560073037.0

&amp;#x200B;

I have come to you hoping for some companionship in a struggle I think a growing number of us can relate to. I've just retaken the Pottermore Sorting quiz... three times. I'm a lifelong, legitimately sorted Gryffindor here (not a ""fake"" Gryffindor). I took the original Pottermore quiz years ago and that's what I got. After hearing some chatter about the 2019 updates, I decided to retake the quiz for fun. I had to do so twice because I almost couldn't believe my results. I got Hufflepuff twice in a row. Now, I don't think this is bad. At first I did, but I can sort of understand, after some reading and reflection, why I would be Hufflepuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, though, I'm fairly certain I could be a classic Hatstall, where the choice comes down to your personal preference. I could see things I would like in either House and Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tend to get on well with each other as well. How do I decide which House I really want to be part of? Does anyone else feel split loyalty to multiple Houses after retaking the Sorting quiz?

**Was Dumbledore the greatest athrimancer ever?** There seems to be a ton of instances where Dumbledore seemed to know what was going to happen before it did. *I remember after watching the third movie, I just assumed he used a time turner every day to make it seem like he was this all knowing powerful wizard lol*. For many reasons, I would say that idea doesn't hold much merit, however...it got me thinking about divination/arithmancy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dumbledore's attitude towards divination is very much like Hermione's. He is dismissive of the art in general. I believe this is because it relies on interpretation and guessing and Dumbledore said many times he doesn't like to guess, he likes to know 100% of the information if possible. He seems like a natural fit for arithmancy.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is his watch. 12 hands with planets revolving around them that Dumbledore can somehow interpret and read. In Chamber of Secrets at the end when Dumbledore/potter/malfoy are in his office, he has this wierd writing table on his desk that has all sorts of intersecting lines and some odd symbols and numbers with stars around the borders. In OOtP he says he didn't know about the change in time, but arrived 3 hours early by a happy coincidence. And then there is all the event manipulation leading to the end of Deathly Hallows, where it seems like Dumbledore had known all sorts of things that were going to happen after his death and gave orders to PROFESSOR Snape.

Because the whole plan is too let Harry touch the Triwizard cup so Harry teleports to Voldemort place, so Voldemort rises from the dead. But that plan seems so far fetched to me, because you have to make sure Harry wins every time. Why couldn't it be simplier like Idk turn Harry's closet in a portkey or something.

In the second movie Hermione hands Ron and Harry cupcakes with a 'very strong sleep-potion' to make Crabbe and Goyle sleep while they interrogate Malfoy using the polyjuice. This should not be legal for obvious reasons. They could have done literally anything they wanted with the two. Same goes for love-potions as explained in another recent thread. Are there more, somewhat rapey, spells and potions in the Harry Potter universe or is it managed at some point in the books that this magic is prohibited or maybe even impossible to use.",harrypotter,NSFW The wizarding world and rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bybwuf/nsfw_the_wizarding_world_and_rape/,1559995219.0

1135,CunningAllusionment,1560019988,"A couple of days ago, we finished reading the first Harry Potter book to our 8 and 5 year olds for the first time. Just now, while playing with Legos, the 8 year old urgently wanted to know how to spell Voldemort (we've been homeschooling so he's not ""at grade level"" he's at ""his level""). I wrote it out for him and he pointed out that VOLDE is an anagram for LOVED and is almost ""the opposite of LOVED"". Then he asked what MORT means. We get MORT in MORTuary and MORTified and imMORTal from the latin word MORT which means ""death"".

  
So Voldemort is an anagram that means something like ""dead love"" or maybe ""the death of love"".

1137,hufflerian,1560019783,"I have a huge problem with people labeling Snape as an incel. Look, I don't even like his character or think he was a good guy but imo it's important to clarify things about the incels community :

They hate women. They hate them with a burning passion and would like to see rape legalized. They want to get laid. They encourage misogyny and even arranged marriages.

And, i'm sorry to disappoint you guys but Snape never showed any of those traits in canon. Never. Every time he's verbally abusive to a woman it's because he's either a bigot or because he hates harry's friends. Snape was a dick to everyone regardless of their gender he didn't target women specifically.

The only things Snape had in common with incels was his ugliness and a woman who never reciprocated his ""feelings"" (if had any but that's not the point of my post).
Do we have any proof in canon that Snape has ever been sexually attracted to anyone in his life anyway ??? 

I'm convinced that when people say that Snape was an incel they mean that he was impossible to love because of his terrible personality and looks and i'm also pretty sure that not every man who's impossible to love has to be an incel.

Not every man who likes a woman who doesn't love them back is an incel either. 

Maybe find another word to describe him ??? A ghoul ? lmao  

Incel doesn't fit to Snape's character. It's a term people use loosely these days and it's dangerous because they dismiss the misoginistic aspect of the incel culture.

Was Snape a failure, a terrible monster no one could ever love ? Yes.

Was Snape sexually frustrated and blamed all the women for not wanting to date him, IN THE BOOKS ? No. 
If anything Snape was a volcel because he was too obsessed with a dead woman to accept someone's love.

You need to keep in mind that having interpretations is cool but they need to be supported by the text to be valid. Otherwise they are just fanons and can't be used as arguments to justify your hate for a character.",harrypotter,Snape and the incel culture.,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/byb6yo/snape_and_the_incel_culture/,1559990983.0

1157,stickymoosefred,1560009284,"*Rant Alert*

Why did be scream and why did his fury explode like a bomb at her death? Why did he attempt to kill Molly? He didn't even have that intense of a reaction when Nagini died and it was definitely not because he was afraid to lose the war. Lord Voldemort would never rely on a single Death Eater who didn't even master her wand especially when he thought that he was the master of the Elder Wand. What was the point of this? It was not significant to the plot in any way. Why did JK Rowling have him do it? What did she think? I think it was just stupid and waste of lines. My cheerful mood due to her death was ruined by the stupid scream. Did she try to humanise him or something? If that was the case, then it was an extremely stupid thing to even try. Bellatrix's death is the only part in the Battle of Hogwarts that I prefer in the movies because there was no ridiculous scream. I cringed at the scream. Why did she have to do it? I just need to know why it was worth mentioning in the books. And Snape was clearly his favourite at that time, not Bellatrix. It makes no sense that he didn't even regret Snape's death but went all bonkers on the death of a woman who had lost him a piece of his soul less than a day ago. I am not saying that he would regret Snape's death. What I am saying is that Lord Voldemort would never react like that to the death of a mere servant.

This tends to bother me a lot in situations of house pride. For example, when choosing special book editions or merchandising. 

I've taken the pottermore test and lot of surveys and quizzes that specifies the percentage of ""house"" you get. Every time Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff get really close percentages, with Ravenclaw always at the front.

I really identify with both. I'm very study and knowledge oriented, I love having good grades and do my best at work or school at all times. One of the reasons I chose a path in medicine is so that I can be constantly learning, but (apart from  being able to detach myself emotionally) personality wise I'm a Hufflepuff.

I'm told I'm very nice (and people do try to take an advantage at that), approachable, I love to help and I find goodness in almost everyone.

Note: I do know that belonging to a house does not mean I need to check all of the boxes as I said it only bothers me in house pride situations in regular situations I comfortably say that I'm an Ravenpuff.",harrypotter,Belonging to more than one house confusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/by8xc0/belonging_to_more_than_one_house_confusion/,1559977932.0
1162,lavendel666,1560005836,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So i was wondering lately if it was possible to come up with an easy to make, interactive drinking game for 2 to multiple people. Also could be played as a normal game ofcourse since you know, alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about Quidditch meets Beerpong, but instead of a lot of cups just three like the goals in Quidditch.  
And when there are people standing around the table, one person gets a gold coloured ball aka the Snitch and should throw this at a random time and the team who catches it has won the game (like the other team should all take a few shots?).

1201,TheToxicWyvern,1559967554,"Specifically I hate the idea that Harry is a Horcrux and that is the reason why the Dursleys abused him for the majority of the series. There is so much that angers me about the theory. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Contradicts Canon : The best example we have of the effects of Horcruxes is the Locket from Deathly Hallows.  While the locket did make the trio bicker, it only had an effect when they wore it.  Horcruxs only have an effect on people when they are close. I think its safe to say that the Dursley's never even hugged Harry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, how come no one else is affected by Harry's alleged Horcrux powers. In fact, the people who are the closest to Harry (Hermione, Ron, the other Gryffindor boys, the rest of the Weasley Family, etc) tend to be the most protective and kind to him, a completely reverse of how Horcruxes work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides all that, the canon already gave in reason. In the very first chapter of the very first book, it clearly explains that the Durleys hate magic. Harry is magic, ergo the Durleys hate Harry.  That'd be like letting a Neo-Nazi adopt a black child, then blaming horcrux magic for inevitable lynching. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Dehumanizes Harry: It literally reduces Harry to an object. A cursed object. A cursed object who's only purpose in the story is to be completely destroyed. 

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Attempts to Excuse the Dursleys for their Abusive Actions: Self explanatory. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) Blatantly Ignores Reality: I've actually heard people say that no adult would treat a child like that.  Apparently, the millions of children who are neglected, abandoned, scapegoated, beaten, raped, tortured and killed are all cursed objects who brought it upon themselves.  Do I even need to explain the problem here?

Homeland of WHITE people? POC are nowhere near a majority there, and never have been. Simply put, it is the continent of white people, their birthright home. It would be inaccurate to portray the vast majority of Hogwarts students and the British wizarding community as a whole as anything BUT white. If the story were set in, say, Japan or Ethiopia, of course you would see majority Asian and black faces, respectively. 

Harry Potter's characters are primarily white because they are set in a white country. Period. JKR isn't racist because she wanted to set a story in her own homeland. The cool thing about America is it's traditionally been very multicultural, unlike most nations of the old world. So, as we saw in the first FB movie, many more ethnic groups besides just Europeans were represented. There wasn't anything weird about seeing a black president in that movie, because black people have almost always been here, and were certainly here in the 1920s. 

My advice to those who are upset about lack of representation for their own people is this: write a fanfiction depicting wizards in a historically accurate context. Or, better yet, make up your own series set in your own homeland. It's perfectly fine to do that. But you can't expect other writers to conform to your ways of doing things and complain when they choose to write a story that's more attuned to their own culture and sense of familiarity. And honestly, don't you think it would have been a tad offensive if JKR HAD written from the primary view point of someone of a different race? As a white woman, how can she, in good conscience, claim to understand the experiences of those from a different background enough to write a believable (even though fictional) story about it? I've found that cultures are best represented by the people to whom they belong. So, again, if you want to see yourself represented in a wizarding story, go right ahead and write one, because you're probably the best person for the job anyway. Just set the story in an appropriate setting if you want it to be even somewhat realistic.

All the things that can not be explained, that somehow, have to be explained.

This has to have some effect on the children, surely. Knowing you can do things and people being afraid of it. There's no canon that I know of that delves into this. Even though Hermione would have been in this situation, it doesn't seem to be mentioned very often. I wonder if there is a department in the ministry allocated to this? Or a separate job, outside of the ministry. THIS is what actually got me thinking.

Personally, I mostly agree. I would see Ironman in Slytherin, because he is definitely cunning and ambitious. Thor I would put into Hufflepuff - he is so loyal to Loki, even after everything that happened. Same with Nebula, she does everything she does out of loyalty to either Thanos or Gamora. And Scarlet Witch - no idea where to put her. Not Ravenclaw though. And not Hufflepuff either.

1300,Melusinahp,1559893324,"One of the reasons the “Draco was the boy who had no choice” thing bothers me so much, aside from how deeply it undercuts his both his agency and personal responsibility, is that the the choices Draco did make were *so important*.

He chose to lower his wand on the tower. He chose not to kill Dumbledore. He made a choice as to the kind of person he wanted to be. 

He chose not to identify Harry in the Manor. Lucius was right, if the Malfoy’s had been the ones to capture Harry Potter they’d have been showered in glory by Voldemort. And yet, Draco still didn’t make it happen. 

He also chose to break Harry’s nose on the train and to cast an Unforgivable at him. Those choices are also important aspects of his character. You can’t understand Draco if you reduce him to a mindless pawn.

Draco had choices. He made choices. He was used and manipulated by Voldemort, but he was fully on board with his mission until the reality of what he had to do sunk in. He could have made things much easier for himself. He stubbornly refused Snape’s offer of help because he wanted all the gory.

And it’s interesting to me that the people who claim he had no choice tend to overlap a lot with people who claim Draco was robbed of a redemption arc. (He wasn’t. His character arc was complete in the books.) And that makes no sense. If you want him redeemed, first you have to allow him responsibility for his choices so he can atone for them. 

I don’t think people really wanted him redeemed. I think they wanted it revealed that he’d been a soft, good guy all along and have Harry beg his forgiveness for misjudging him. Maybe that’s extreme, but I think there’s at least a grain of truth in it. ",harrypotter,Draco Malfoy–The Boy Who Made Choices,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bxrsc7/draco_malfoythe_boy_who_made_choices/,1559864524.0

#Magical Pastimes

It’s June, and witches and wizards around the globe are looking for a way to spend their school holidays! This month, we’d like to compile a list of ways magical folks typically entertain themselves during the summer break from school. Perhaps it will give the rest of us some ideas on how to spend our upcoming free time :)

Please submit your ideas for magical games, sports, and activities (other than quidditch and wizard’s chess, of course) that parents can use to keep their students busy--and therefore out of trouble--this summer! Some categories you might consider:

- Board games
- Playground games
- Organized sports leagues
- Summer camps
- Art classes
- School-inspired tourism
- Or any other muggle summer activity with its own magical flair!


&amp;nbsp;

##The deadline for submissions is ***11:59pm ET on Thursday, June 27.*** Feel free to submit your responses in written, visual, video, musical, or other format as you see fit.

Nicholas was a loner wizard that had no one. He had no friends or family. He was never shown any attention in the Wizarding World so moved to a small village near the north pole and made up the idea of giving muggle children what they wanted every Christmas to gain attention. He came up with the name Santa and done this by feeding reindeer magic flying food and a time turner to make sure he gets around the world in one night. He realised that he was loved and children wanted more so he started using house elves to make the presents for children.

He was much loved and became legend in the muggle world.

In-universe, we can certainly think of a few reasons why they wouldn't have joined. Membership in the Order is voluntary (even though drafts are common during times of war in the muggle world, apparently the wizarding world doesn't have them), and maybe they're sad at Cedric dying, but aren't willing to risk their own lives.

But then again, where did Cedric get his unwavering loyalty and resolve that made his death so crushing to us readers, if not from his upbringing?

But from a literary standpoint, why didn't J.K. Rowling write the Diggories in as being Order members? Having them as Order members would have given the Order a lot more canon fodder so that J.K. Rowling could have killed them off to create drama, especially in the Battle of Hogwarts, when their survival after that point couldn't possibly have been necessary to the story (since the story was wrapping up at that point), and so Order members were already dying left, right, and center as it is!

Harry potter, owner of the deathly hallows, gets possessed by his fame and power (unlike Dumbledore predicted) and becomes Lord of Light for the purpose of “greater good”.

While yes, they are good books and movies, I feel as though they are given too much credit for what they really are. I understand that a lot of people have childhood nostalgia about Harry Potter, and that they're pretty good books to read as you're going through middle to high school. But that's it. I read through them once, but that's all I could handle. I don't want to say it was lazy writing, but when you cant glean anything new or more interesting from a book with each read through then I think it's pretty shallow writing.

While childhood nostalgia may be nice for many things like: pokemon, Disney movies, and other such things, there are also many places where nostalgia may be holding people back from developing. Take it's a small world in Disneyland for example. Yes, it was great for what was happening at the time, and yes many people loved it as a kid, but the song, automatons, and ride altogether just feel outdated. Much like Harry Potter.

1481,no_not_luke,1559767917,"The most common argument I see against time travel in the Harry Potter books is along the lines of: ""Why doesn't Harry and Co. (or Dumbledore/Snape etc.) just go back in time and kill Voldemort when he's younger?"" Which, if I remember the plot of Cursed Child correctly (although I'm not sure I can, most of us try not to remember it), CC is basically built on that premise - using time travel to fix/avoid mistakes in the past.

The problem with this kind of time travel is that it creates multiple juxtaposed paradoxical realities. If Harry goes back in time to kill Voldemort, there's no way to trace a consistent path along his timeline: if Voldemort dies in the past, then when the passage of time in this new timeline places us again in the moment where present Harry would travel backward to kill Voldemort, he has no reason to do it (Voldemort doesn't exist). But if Harry from the present doesn't travel backward, then no one kills Voldemort, and the story progresses as the books tell it. I wish I could map it out, but do you see what I mean? I'm genuinely asking: if this isn't clear, please say so. I'll edit the post and do my best to clear things up.

But that type of time travel is not what Rowling creates in Prisoner of Azkaban. The time travel that is established in the Wizarding World follows the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle, which is fancyspeak for saying that things in the past can be caused by events in the future but cannot be changed. Future Harry and Future Hermione don't *change* the past by freeing Buckbeak before he's killed; he's never killed in the first place, but saved by people from the future. Rowling leaves that event ambiguous when the past versions of our trio witness it (they're all turned around when they hear the ""thud"" of the axe, and they hear Hagrid's wail), but she illustrates what really happens when the future versions of Harry and Hermione are the ones actually inciting the event (the ""thud"" of the axe is the axe being slammed in anger; Hagrid's wail is actually one of ecstasy).

You can read through the final three hours of PoA and see that both ways the trio experience that night are completely consistent with the other's perspective (thus the ""Consistency"" principle). Voldemort can't be killed in the past because we know he survives to the present. For all we know, one of the ""disappearances"" of a person during either of Voldemort's reigns of terror was some witch or wizard with a private Time Turner travelling back in time to kill Voldemort pre-Potter-slaughter:

1. They travel backward in time, disappearing from their present.
2. They travel to Godric's Hollow and find Voldemort near the edge of town, before he is near the Potter house like we see in flashbacks.
3. They attack him but he kills them. He disposes of the body so well that nobody finds it from this time in the past all the way to the witch or wizard's present day. Thus, the witch or wizard is perceived as missing in their present, and no multiple timelines are in play.

In this way, every event in the Harry Potter series still occurs, *even with witches and wizards possibly travelling back in time*. There's no place for paradoxes in the Harry Potter series, and in both the series and this post, travelling backwards to defeat Voldemort is demonstrated to be impossible.

Will someone please tell me if I'm missing something? I believe I have a pretty airtight argument, but if someone can burst my bubble, please do.

1498,SweetPotayto23,1559754894,"Hello all,
I have been re-reading the books and noticed something funny in the Philosopher’s stone (or Sorcerer’s for the Americans).

In the chapter ‘Diagon Alley’ it begins with Harry and Hagrid waking up at the shack on the rock shortly after Hagrid has (spoiler alert!) told Harry that ‘yurr a wizard ‘arry’. 

Hagrid informs Harry that they’ll be setting off to the glitz and glamor of Diagon Alley to pick up the bits and pieces he needs before starting Hogwarts. ‘But how to get there?!’ Harry asks.

Hagrid tells Harry that he got to the shack by flying, but that he can’t use magic now he’s picked Harry up. He opts for the 2 of them to get to their destination by boat.

Seems fine enough right?

But wait!

The Dursleys and Harry arrived to the shack by a boat. Hagrid has already said he flew there (I could go into detail about whether or not he used Sirius’ motorcycle). So Harry and Hagrid are essentially taking the only boat from the rock away, leaving the Dursleys stranded in a tiny shack on a small rock in the middle of nowhere with no means to get back or send for help. 

Now whilst we know that the Dursleys deserve a bit of karma coming their way, Hagrid is an absolute savage for leaving them stranded there!

1502,average_texas_guy,1559752418,"As I am a fairly recent convert to the Wizarding World, I had to do all of the various quizzes that can be found on Pottermore. I was sorted, somewhat surprisingly, into Gryffindor. My wand selected me and I immediately found a talented wandsmith to reproduce it in intricate detail. I even found out that I was a Pukwudgie.

Then it came time for me to discover my Patronus. This was an incredible quiz and if you haven't done it yet I highly suggest you block out some time, turn off the lights, put on your headphones, and do it. The end result of my Patronus journey revealed that mine was a brown hare.

Initially, I was a bit put off by this. It seemed a bit dull. Other people were getting cool creatures some even magical. Here I was with a little brown rabbit. And then, out of nowhere, it hit me. I realized how incredibly accurate and personal this Patronus was as if it were genuinely selected just for me.

To get to the importance of the Patronus, I ask that you allow me to engage you in a bit of brief personal history. It isn't so incredibly interesting but I do hope it won't bore you too terribly much. You see my wife and I met in the fall of 1994, long before many of you were even born I would imagine. She has pulled me, sometimes kicking and screaming, through some very hard times in my life. I try not to imagine what fate would have had in store for me had we never met. She is always there for me when I need her and for that and a million other reasons, I will love her forever.

As most couples do, we have pet names for each other. You can probably imagine that after 25 years, there is quite a collection of pet names that have built up. However, there are 2 that have stuck and remain the primary names of choice for each of us. She refers to me often as her bear because I suppose she sees me as a protective sort. I refer to her as my little rabbit because she is so sweet and adorable. This hit me like a truck when I finally had the sense to put 2 and 2 together. For 25 years I have called my beacon of light in an occasionally terrifying and dark world, as my rabbit. And then 25 years later, a website about a magic world decided that the thing that I could summon. The thing I could make appear to save me when the hour was most bleak, was a rabbit. A brown hare to be specific.

Now when I call her my rabbit it has an even stronger meaning than it had before. I just wanted to share this tale of love and coincidence.

1537,poeticwasteland,1559722378,"Okay, hear me out for a sec here, because I know everyone is always picking on Dumby for what on the surface appears to be blatant Gryffindor/Harry Potter favouritism, what with the last minute point giving &amp; the “change of decoración” then needing to be in order...but I started thinking/wondering, what if he’s giving Harry &amp; Co. those points out of guilt — Hermione, Neville, and Harry had a nearly identical amount of points deducted from Gryffindor by Professor McGonagall for being out of bed after hours. And of course they only were out of bed so late because they’d been doing something for Hagrid, something Hagrid couldn’t/wouldn’t have been able to do on his own. Operation “Get Rid of Norbert” ended up costing Potter &amp; co those 150 points. 

Now, here’s the thing; all logic dictates Dumbledore, to whom it was basically impossible to lie to or trick, had to know about the existence of Norbert. And, if he knew, it also seems logical, (given the way he handles Hagrid during the Buckbeak ordeal later on in the series) that Dumbledore himself would’ve, or definitely should have, taken on the responsibility for “Operation Get Rid of Norbert”. 

There was no reason for those kids to be out of bed that night carting a highly dangerous magical creature to the top of the tallest tower in order to transfer it in midair. Not if Dumbledore also knew about the dragon. And I find it very difficult to believe he didn’t. And if he knew, then the fact that the kids had to deal with the dragon situation means he’d been irresponsible &amp; possibly derelict in his duties (to the students) as their headmaster.

And then McGonagall caught them and punished them accordingly, yet apparently harshly, to boot. She crushed any hope Gryffindor had of winning the house cup that year when she took those points. Which in light of the mitigating circumstances related to why Harry &amp; Co were out of bed so late, is actually fair. And Dumbledore knows it, because he knows they ought not to have had to accept “operation get rid of the effing dragon”, because he should’ve been the one dealing with the creature &amp; w/ Hagrid. But Dumby can’t admit that to McGonagall &amp; just ask her to return the points immediately because it was all kinda a big misunderstanding. Because to do so would not only make himself look bad, but it would also expose Hargid. And then Dumbledore gets lucky! Harry saves the school (and the world) from Voldy’s return, and his friends all help hin. So he just decides to use that event as an opportunity to return points he basically caused Gryffindor to lose in the first place. 

I mean it’s still a rather selfish, dickwad move, but I feel like it’s slightly less douchey if he was only showing Gryffindor that favouritism because he effed shit up for them in the first place, and so is trying to right a wrong, rather than arbitrarily offering intrinsic rewards merely to the people you like more than others because you like them more.

I had an anxiety attack last night that was retriggered this morning (we moved today, I haven't worked in over a week trying to prepare - I'm self-employed, the summit I'm planning keeps growing, my youngest is at a stage where everything - joy, anger, sadness - results in screaming and I just got tipped over the edge)

BUT I'm very happy right now because while I've suffered from horrible nightmares since I was a teen, I think I've mentioned here before that listening to the Harry Potter audio books before I go to bed drastically soothes them in a way no other solution has. (Luckily my husband is also a big fan) So, a few weeks ago when I saw some of the Pottery Barn bedding and stuff and was lamenting the fact that our boys aren't old enough for Potter yet, my husband said, ""Why not just get it for us?"" 

And I did!

I've been hyperventilating on and off all day, was wearing two sweatshirts earlier today even though it was 70 degrees outside because anxiety attacks make me freezing cold and shake, and I walked into our bedroom tonight and instantly felt a little better.

I used to feel weird about seeming like a weird adult still in love with a children's series, but those books meant so much to me in my youth when I was first suffering from depression and anxiety -- along with a lot of crap at home -- and I just love that something little like this can bring me a sense of calm ♥️

1570,TheKingsPeace,1559685916,"I just relalized how brilliant and intentional JKRs use of the four animals for the four houses are. I used to think any animals would do. The more I think of it the four animals were perfect and have a lot of underlying symbolism.

1. Gryffindor- Lion. The name Gryffindor suggests someone bold, daring and with self esteem to spare. The maned Lion is the perfect image for that. King of the beasts, brave and fierce. A great friend ( pride mate?) but with ego to spare. It has been the preferred sigil for many royal families including the English royal family. 

2. Ravenclaw- Eagle.I guess the name is a bit misleading. Why have an eagle represent a house with Raven in the name? I guess eagle is associated with the element of air, the element most associated with knowledge and intuition.

You could say Ravenclaw is the house associated with intellect, wit and learning ( although I think Luna Lovegood is a gross and tawdry parody of this).  Like Ravenclaw, the eagle is removed from the cares and distractions of the tangible and focuses its energy on the intellect, air intangibles.

3. Hufflepuff- Badger. Though I am a Hufflepuff, I have to admit the name doesn’t do much for ones self esteem and perhaps the badger is the least impressive of the four creatures. Yet it’s the perfect animal imo. Hufflepuffs tend to be sort of unglamorous people. Grounded, down to earth like badgers in a hole. Badgers tend to be gruff and cantankerous in literature. Like the Lion fierce and tough but far less likely to start anything. Although they are the least acclaimed I might guess there is an inward decency, wherewithal to deal effectively deal with life’s dissapontments and the defects of others that many in the other houses lack or aren’t interested in developing.

Slytherin- snake. The name Slytherin is obviously in tune with having a snake. Like snakes Slytherins are cunning, agile and calculating.

Saying J.K. Rowling wrote at a lucky time just doesn’t cut it. There has literally been nothing like it before or since.

I have my theories.

1. Everyone is looking for their own Hogwarts. Life can be hard and even terrible as a child or adolescent to varying degrees. To say Harry won the lottery in the first book is to put it mildly.  People enjoy the very real escape and cool world that was Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. It’s like school if it were actually fun 😏!

2. The characters are engaging. They are all very believable, multifaceted and fascinating individuals. Their situations are believable and their problems relatable. Adolescents and children are painted in a very realistic light. Teachers too, though I think they were allowed to be more like Snape in JKRs day than today.

3. There is a strong moral compass to the series. In spite of what right wing Christian groups say, i found the books very moral and very instructive in teaching kids right and wrong. Pride, selfishness and snobbery are always made out to be bad/ undesirable and diversity/ inclusiveness is made to look good in a very convincing but not heavy handed way",harrypotter,Why is Harry Potter so popular?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bwuknx/why_is_harry_potter_so_popular/,1559656067.0

The citizens of Hogsmeade are so excited to announce the first annual Summer Carnival! Your faculty liasons during this exciting celebration will be /u/BottleofAlkahest and /u/the-phony-pony. Hogsmeade has given us six possible ways you can participate in the Summer Carnival.

1. Create a game! Carnivals always have fun little game stations for patrons to play. You can turn to the Muggle world for inspiration or create your own game. (We think creating your own might be more fun!)

2. Join the parade! Hogsmeade is looking for floats for the processional down the main road. Create a fun and inspirational ride for all to enjoy!

3. Help the local shops decorate. I'm sure Mr. Aberforth might want some help spicing up the ol' Hogs Head for some new clients.

4. Dress up yourself! Create a festive costume for you (or your magical pet!) to celebrate the occasion!

5. Host a friendly competition! Some of us like a bit more of a challenge than a simple carnival game. Maybe a high stakes game would attract more visitors?

6. Host your own food stand! We want to see some special delicacies you might create. Describe your stand - what do you have to sell? Is there a theme? Are you family friendly, or oriented to a more adult crowd?

I like Molly Weasley as a character, but she was a straight up bitch towards Fleur Delacour for quite a while.

Then she implies that the wedding will be called off because Bill has been attacked and Fleur finally snaps at Molly and stands up for herself. I love this moment. We as the reader finally see that Fleur is indeed in love with Bill, and that's when Molly sees it for the first time too. Fleur deserves this moment. She has been in love with Bill, has embraced the entire Weasley family, and Molly has been horrible towards her the entire time. 

Consider some of the things she has said that annoyed everybody. When Hermione got that black eye from Fred and George's punching telescope Fleur's response is (paraphrased), ""Ah, Bill has told me how amusing Fred and George are."" That annoys Hermione in the moment, because she has the black eye, but Fleur is just trying to relate what she knows of the family. She's paying attention to her fiance's life because she cares.

She annoys everyone by talking a lot, but then we see how talkative her and her sister are. She's literally just trying to fit in and get to know everybody and she's doing it by being herself.

So I’m rewatching the Half-Blood Prince with my boyfriend (it’s his first time) and something just occurred to me. When Harry and Dumbledore finished watching the real memory about horcruxes from Slughorn, Dumbledore shows Harry the ruined diary and the ring. 

While discussing that a horcrux could be anything, Harry touches the ring and it begins to spin rapidly and Harry sees rapid images flash within his mind. The scene then cuts back to Harry and his neck moves the way it did in Order of the Pheonix — when Harry’s connecting to Voldemort. 

We then see Dumbledore staring intently at Harry, potentially truly recognizing Harry as a horcrux for the first time because of the exceptional reaction the two horcrux carriers (Harry and the ring) just had to each other. 

While Dumbledore was obviously sure at this point Voldemort had made multiple horcruxes and that Harry and Voldemort were undeniably connected, perhaps it was in this single moment during the movies Dumbledore realized WHY Harry and Voldemort where so similar. WHY they were connected.

1629,Fantastic_Bat,1559636056,"On a reread of Goblet of Fire, I came across this quote, and it just reminded me of how much different Tom Riddle was from wizardkind (and indeed, most of humanity).

A little context: The Death Eaters had come out and started running amok after the Quidditch World Cup, and someone shot up the Dark Mark, causing mass panic. Ron, afterwards, asks what the big deal is, it's just a symbol, and Hermione tells him it was the Dark Lord's symbol, followed by Arthur Weasley telling him how the Death Eaters would send that emblem up after killing someone, then delivers that quote.

Arthur, for all intents and purposes, was wrong, though: It wasn't *everyone's* worst fear. It's certainly most people's worst fear, to come home and find their loved ones dead, murdered while they were out (and for most of us, it's not exactly an *active* fear, but if we thought there was a real probability of it happening, it would quickly *become* our biggest fear), but you know who *doesn't* have that fear? *You-Know-Who!*

The Dark Lord doesn't fear losing loved ones, because he loves no one. The only thing he fears is death, the only thing he loves is himself.

Things like this just show how he views love as a weakness, largely because he's never really been capable of it, and stumbling on this quote in my reread just sorta highlighted that for me, how JKR was setting this up from the get-go, how Tom Riddle became so obsessed with the very concept of seeking out everlasting life that he forgot to live in the process.

I dunno. This quote just felt somehow poignant to me, reading it again and knowing what I do now. When I first read the book, I was closer to Harry's age, and saw things from a much narrower perspective, closer to Harry's own. Now, I'm closer to Arthur's age, and rereading it, I find I'm identifying with him and his contemporaries more. I can still remember my perspective on it back then, but it's like there's something new to it now, like that older adult perspective was always there in the books, just waiting for me to be old enough to pick it up properly. 

Makes me wonder what future readthroughs might have in store for me, and what things'll stand out to me when I'm rereading them at McGonagall's age.",harrypotter,"'Just picture coming home, and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside. ..Everyone's worst fear. . .

1647,talliman98,1559614745,"  

I have read the HP books more times than I can count. They are by far my favorite series of books (at least so far) but there are a couple of things that have always bothered me. JK seemed pretty good at putting reason to the decisions made by Harry, and especially Dumbledore, even if we didn’t recognize them as they were occurring except for two very major plot points. There may be more than what I’m pointing out here but these are the ones that stick out to me. 

1. Dumbledore was adamant that Harry not tell anyone what he was learning in his private lessons except for Ron and Hermione including what he learned about the prophesy. This served two very important purposes although only one of them may have been clear at the time. 

· Dumbledore did not want Voldemort to know that he knew so much about his past and more importantly that he knew about the Horcruxes. 

· Dumbledore, knowing that his life was soon going to end, and knowing that Harry may not be able to complete the task ahead wanted to make sure that at least two others could pick up where they left off if needed. 

2. Dumbledore told Snape that Voldemort’s life was tied to a fragment of soul trapped inside of Harry and for him to ultimately be defeated, Harry must die. 

To the first point I must say it makes perfect sense. Dumbledore is playing a very grand game of Chess and being very careful where he puts his pieces. He places them so well in fact that he is still controlling the game long after his death. He predicts how Harry, Hermione, Ron, Voldemort, and even the Ministry of Magic will react to his death, the War, and several other subsequent events with near flawless precision. As I said it all makes sense…. up until Voldemort knows that Harry is hunting Horcruxes.  Once he figures this out I don’t see any reason why Harry would continue to keep it a secret. Voldemort knows that Harry is aware of his anchors to life. He knows that Harry is in Hogwarts. He knows that Harry will visit Ravenclaw Tower. Harry knows that Voldemort knows this. Why on earth would he continue to keep this knowledge to himself? Even when he goes off to die, he only tells Neville. He has the Order of the Phoenix (including two Aurors), The Weasley Family, and the Hogwarts Professors all there ready to fight for him and he doesn’t tell any of them? A few chapters previous Harry has this grand awakening where he seems to understand everything. His brain is working in ways that it never did before and he didn’t get the hint that the only reason he had to keep this a secret was already blown?

To the second point, why was Snape the only one that Dumbledore told about the fragment of Voldemort’s soul that was latched to Harry? He was very careful to make sure at least three people knew about the other Horcruxes. Snape was probably in more danger of death than anyone, including Harry. Not only was he playing a very dangerous double agent game with the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever known, it was planned for him to kill Dumbledore making him the destined owner of the Elder Wand. Dumbledore had at least some idea that Voldemort would try to come for the wand at some point so being of above average intelligence he should have planned for the eventuality of Snape’s demise. Why then would he leave Snape to be the only one who could tell Harry about this connection? This was an important part of the plan. He knew that Harry would sacrifice himself to save everyone else, thus completing the same protective charm that his mother had given him. It just seems crazy to me that he wouldn’t put some type of failsafe in place just in case Snape were to die before he could tell Harry about the connection. This in fact very nearly happened.

But as an adult I have some issues sleeping and no longer have a mother in my house who can read to me. My genius solution was to get the audiobook copies of the books I’ve read at least 5 times (Harry Potter, obviously) to lull me to sleep. Then it doesn’t matter if I fall asleep and miss something as I know the story well, and I get the added benefit of feeling a warm familiar hug from all the nostalgia and memories.

It worked great until I was about half asleep following along to Book 1 chapter 1 and Baby Dudley learned the word “won’t” instead of the word “shan’t”. I was jarred awake so hard and had a good panic as I realized that I in fact had a copy of the SS audiobook and there was no way for me to acquire the PS version on iTunes, or amazon, or wherever without some significant computer magic of which I am not capable.

All I want is Stephen Fry’s voice reading me to sleep with the books of my childhood. I would happily acquire these thing through legal means with an exchange of money, but I have clearly missed the opportunity to do this within Canada.

I assume that after a good long sleep and a sandwich, Harry, Ron and Hermione debriefed everyone about what they had been doing for the previous nine months. I'm sure Kingsley, as the new Minister of Magic, was particularly interested.

How about the Minister for/of Magic, and his/her similarities and differences to the Prime Minister? Let's start with differences. The Prime Minster is the elected the majority party in the Parliament. In the Wizarding World, shouldn't the Minister of Magic (I give up on for/of, and I'm an American) be elected by the majority party in the Wizengamot? Which brings me to the Wizengamot, and (Wizarding) political parties. 

The Wizengamot is basically the Ministry of Magic's legislature. It is a unicameral legislative system (I do not like unicameral legislatures) with what I can assume are elected officials (if not, that's just messed up and officially makes the Ministry a dictatorship). It has a Chief Warlock (equivalent to Speaker of the House of Commons), and should have Majority and Minority Leaders. Notice that I said should.

1675,Ostrich_the_man,1559590242,"Before the official Ilvermorny story came out I started writing my own story. I restarted it a few days ago and here's the first chapter:

Chapter *One*

Iris woke with a start. She heard banging outside her room. She looked around and her brother and sister Charles and Elizabeth weren’t there. Groggy from just waking up she walked out into the kitchen to see it in total chaos. Her mother Tabatha was waving her wand like crazy and everything in the kitchen was flying into boxes. There were boxes full of stuff everywhere.

“What’s going-” Iris was cut off when her father burst into the room

“Tabatha let’s go we don’t have enough time we *need* to get out here before she comes!” Her dad looked stressed. More stressed then when he was fired.

“Mommy, Daddy what’s going on.” Iris asked. Both her parents looked at her then looked at each other.

“Iris sweetie we’re moving” Tabatha said bending down to talk to Iris. “Now go to the living room with your brother and sisters I’ll explain later.”

“But Mommy I don’t want to-” she was interrupted again by her father

“Iris. Go. Now.” her father was rarely strict so when we talked like that she listened. Iris walked into the living room to find the twins Charles and Elizabeth and Melody sitting on the couch. Melody was the only looking really concerned. 

“Melody what’s goin’ on?” asked Iris.

“Well” replied Melody “We’re in danger. Someone very bad is after us and we need to hide.” Iris being four at the time didn’t really understand what she meant but went along with it because her sister was seventeen, almost eighteen. If Charles had said that she wouldn’t have believed him. He’s always playing pranks on them and he only six.

Suddenly there was a huge bang and the whole house shook. Elizabeth let out a scream and Iris looked at Melody eyes wide with terror. This was the moment she knew, this was real. Her mom and dad came running into the room.

“Is everyone alright?” Tabatha asked frantically looking around the room.

*Bang!*  The house shook again.

“Ok everyone get to the fireplace NOW!” commanded her dad. They all hustled over to the fireplace and got ready to travel by floo powder when they heard a cackling.

“TABATHA! I KNOW YOU’RE IN THERE. COME OUT COME WHEREVER YOU ARE!” a voice echoed all over the house.

“Mom, let me delay her. Get you, dad, and the kids out of here!” Melody said

“No I’m not letting you go out there! It’s too dangerous.” said Tabatha.

“Mom.” she walked over to her mom. “This is the only way. I love you so much!” Melody walked over to her dad “Love you too dad. And Charles and Elizabeth, you’re the best twins anyone could ever ask for.”

Melody bent down next to Iris and gave her a hug. 

“You are strongest person I know, Reach for the stars and nothing less.”

Another bang. Iris’s dad William grabbed her hand and walked over to the fire place. Tabatha did the same to Charles and Elizabeth. Melody looked at everyone one last time. 

“Goodbye everyone. Love you all.” Melody turned around and walked to the door. Wand drawn and ready to fight. William went into the fireplace first to make sure it was safe. He came back a second later and took the twins, Finally it was time for Tabatha and Iris to go. They got into the fireplace. Melody turned to make sure everyone was safe. Tabatha threw down the powder and they twisted away from their home. Iris got one last glimpse of Melody opening the door then being blasted back. Iris let out a scream and it was drowned out as she was engulfed in flames.

So something happened yesterday and I just opened this account to tell you what it is. 

Ok, so my name is Marc and I'm from Spain. I didn't care about Harry Potter until February of 2018, when I watched all 8 movies because I felt the need to. I didn't want to read the books because I don't usually read and it wasn't a big hobby of mine. But this April I read the first book and I loved it, J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job which you can't appreciate just by watching the movies. I'm now finishing the 4th book which at the moment is my favourite. 

Yesterday, I was in my the living room watching the TV when somebody knocked on the door. I went to open it and there was a man standing in front of me. He was at least 60 years old, and he was wearing some old fashioned clothes. I stared at him for a few seconds when he said, in Spanish with an English accent, that he was looking for me and my family (he said our surname).  I don't know why but I didn't felt in danger letting him into my house. I asked him to take a sit on the couch while I went to get my dad (my mom wasn't home). My dad sat in front of the man with a strange look on his face. Then the guy told me if he could speak in English because he felt more confident speaking in English. I'm not a perfect English speaker but I can understand and have a conversation fluently winth another person. So I told him I would do my best to traduce everything to my dad. The man told us his name. He was Arthur Abraham Gladstone and he came to tell my family and I that I was a wizard. I was speechless, I remembered everything from the HP movies and the books I had read but couldn't think of a possibility that that was real. So I traduced it to my dad and he just stared at him for a few seconds and told me to ask him if he was joking (my father is not a fan of HP but he knows what it is so he knew that it seemed like it). The man said that he came from Augront, a school for wizards and witches. He proceded to grab what I can only describe as a wand and pointed it to a candle we have in front of the couch. The candle started floating. Me and my father stared at each other and an image of Hermione doing the Wingardium Leviosa spell popped into my mind. I just said ""What!?""

The man told me I was a wizard and that Augront wanted me to go to their school. It is a public school and I just need to pay for the books and the school suplies. He told me, I had to go to ""Platting Square"" to get my suplies, and that school started on the 1st of September. 

I was surprised because he refered to muggles as muggles so I thought that J.K. Rowling maybe knew this existed...

I asked a lot of questions to Arthur. But here are the ones that might interest you the most. 

* Me: But doesn't the school start at 11 years old? (I'm 17, 18 in about 2 moths).

Arthur: No, it starts when you're 18.

* Me: I've never experienced anithing abnormal or ""magical"", why I'm a wizard?

Arthur: You don't have to experience something, usually, magical manifestations are very subtle, and most of the time   
you don't notice them.

* Me: Where is Augront located?

Arthur: Scotland, you get there by train, just like in the HP movies.

* Me: Is the magical world a secret?

Arthur: No it isn't. It's just hidden from the muggle eye.

* Me: Why J.K. Rowling wrote the books?

Arthur: She did it to help muggles to become wizards by having faith that the HP universe existed. We needed more   
muggles on our school so we had to create the story to select the muggles that had a wizard-like mind from the   
ordinary muggles.

* Me: Are there ""real wizards""?

Arthur: We just call them wizards. But yes. They are wizards with parents whom are wizards.

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusion is that if you really want to go to the real Hogwarts, there is a chance that you can. Since I watched the first movie, I just had a hidden obssession about becoming a wizard, and I believed that it existed. I know a lot of you feel the same way, so don't give up, because it's true!

I have a lot more answers. But I'm a bit tired. If you have any questions, just let me know and I would gladly answer them.",harrypotter,THIS IS IMPORTANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bwdvfy/this_is_important/,1559556619.0
1683,SeekerSpock32,1559585052,"Many Harry Potter fans think that Michael Gambon's reading of the line ""Harry, did you put your name of the Goblet of Fire?"" is the worst thing in the Harry Potter movies. (It isn't, by the way. That would be the rock band at the Yule Ball, but that's an argument for another day.) If they don't think that, they consider it very out of character for Dumbledore to be shouting at Harry like that, especially when, in the book, he's described to have asked that question calmly; or they make jokes about it because it's a ""so-bad-it's-good"" line reading. However, I've done some thinking and I've come to a conclusion that it actually is fitting for Dumbledore to be mad at Harry for possibly submitting his name for the TriWizard Tournament, even though Dumbledore isn't angry in the book. 

&amp;#x200B;

Prefatory Note: While I usually consider book canon to be above movie canon, this is trying to rationalise something that only exists in the movie, so I will consider the separate canons equal for this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people, my mom among them, question why Harry has to compete in the TriWizard Tournament at all. Cedric's older and more experienced and Harry definitely doesn't want to compete in the Tournament at all so it would be better for all involved if the people in charge let Harry not compete. The book and the movie say the Goblet of Fire constitutes a 'binding magical contract' and that's all they really do to explain that. Basically, Harry has to compete because the Goblet says so. However, do we know of any specific binding magical contracts? Yes, yes we do: The Unbreakable Vow, introduced in *Half-Blood Prince*, where if you break the vow, you die. Yes, the Goblet and the Unbreakable Vow are never explicitly linked in the books or movies, so this is in the realm of speculation, but fan theory videos have floated the idea of a connection between those two things before. It's not explicit what the conditions of an Unbreakable Vow with the Goblet of Fire would be other than 'compete in the tasks' and there are a few problems with that, like champions potentially not figuring out the Egg's Riddle and then potentially not competing in the Second Task because of that, or that Fleur Delacour had to bow out early in both the Second and Third Tasks. However, those problems don't really harm this theory that much. What matters is if Harry doesn't compete in the tournament, he dies. Of course, the TriWizard Tournament is notoriously dangerous and many past champions die anyway. This means, if Harry does compete in the tasks, he very easily could die, but if he doesn't, he certainly will die. Got all that?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Harry dying in the TriWizard Tournament would be an enormous problem for the Wizarding World as he would die, but the Horcrux in his body would still be alive with no way to kill it if Harry is buried. If Harry dies, Voldemort would live on with one of his Horcruxes still intact even if someone destroyed all the others. Voldemort also hasn't taken Harry's blood with Lily's protection in it yet, so Harry doesn't have a lifeline if he dies like he will have when Voldemort kills him at the end of *Deathly Hallows.* If Harry died in the TriWizard Tournament, it would be at the wrong time to have any effect on Voldemort's Horcrux inside Harry. So, if Harry had voluntarily put his name into the Goblet of Fire, he would have put himself at a high risk of dying without the Horcrux being destroyed. If he competes, it's a high risk of dying. If he doesn't compete, he's sure to die without the Horcrux being destroyed. If Harry had voluntarily entered himself into the Tournament, he would have put the fate of the entire Wizarding World on the line just for glory in the TriWizard Tournament. Now, if you're Dumbledore, you know that Harry eventually has to die at the hands of Voldemort so that Voldemort can only be defeated, and there's no other way to defeat Voldemort, and Harry has just put himself in a situation where he might die if he did compete but would definitely die if he didn't compete, you'd be pretty angry with him, too. Now, of course, Harry didn't enter his name into the Goblet, but if he had, Dumbledore would have the right to be angry at him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, was Michael Gambon thinking about all of this in his performance? Of course not. They filmed the *Goblet of Fire* movie before the *Half-Blood Prince* book was released, so the Unbreakable Vow wouldn't have been introduced yet in real time, and the *Deathly Hallows* book, where Harry being a horcrux is revealed, was released still two years later than that. Even if they had, Gambon probably wouldn't have thought about those things, because this theory is a really deep cut and it relies on speculation in a few places. Regardless, if you think about all of this, Dumbledore's anger at Harry for possibly putting his name into the Goblet of Fire is not actually as out of place as the memes might have you believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to critique this theory and let me know what you thought or if I got anything wrong or if the leaps in logic I made don't actually make sense.

So, Snape. He deserves criticism and some of his actions are really just childish and just very uncalled for, but i feel like many (not all) hp fans have overlooked what the character was meant to be, someone who will spark a discussion of what is right and wrong and the reasons behind their actions, into a weird type of nice guy. When you read the books and focus on Snape’s character development, while also taking into consideration that the hp books are still children’s books, that distorted (very creepy) image of Snape that fans have been very adamant about and is passed down to newer readers, slightly make the newer reader have a bias against him when reading the book, resulting in not fully understanding that Snape’s character is not meant to be a hero or a straight up villain. He’s a grey character that is meant to be a topic of conversation between fans, someone who some people might understand his actions while others don’t, having a debate whether if the reasons behind his actions are justified or not. I feel like that the 3D image of an antihero Snape was so twisted, the character lost all of its importance and now is just that creepy guy with motives as basic as any other character that is meant to be a villain. 

But that’s only from what i have seen on Tumblr mostly and here too, even though fans here seem to be more reasonable, i think.

1714,ibanezdan,1559567604,"I started reading the books at the age of 8, only the Philosopher's Stone film was released at the time so thereafter whenever a film was released, I had already read the book. As the films continued to come out, as much as I loved the story and understood that the directors needed to have artistic license (and perhaps make attempts to visually mirror the story becoming darker and darker) I was disappointed with the aesthetic. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the first two films and the video games I thought they nailed the aesthetic I imagined in the books (I had Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets on both PlayStation and PC and adored them as a child.)

&amp;#x200B;

Do you ever notice that Hogwarts seems to like less and less comfortable and warm with every film? Here are some shots from the Chamber of Secrets PS2 game, which is my favourite ever representation of the HP universe. It is depicted with warm lighting, rich decoration and carpets and tiles. I love the vastness and intricacy of the place with it's huge multi level libraries and secret passages and rooms and such. They even did a great job on the grounds and the forest! It was easy to believe why Harry would have loved it so much there and seen it as the best home he could have ever wished for.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like how this seems to go away in the later films. I also don't like how the students seem to largely stop wearing their robes and just wear normal school uniforms mainly (gets especially bad for this in Order of the Phoenix) and the castle just looks more and more dingy and cold and uncomfortable. Some rooms that are described in the later films that I would loved to have seen represented in the old aesthetic would be the Room of Requirement and The Prefect's Bathroom where Harry solves the Triwizard golden egg clue.

&amp;#x200B;

One final thought: I've always wished for a Harry Potter MMO (massively multiple player online game) where you could create a character and attend Hogwarts as a first year and advance from there, trade with other players etc. If this were to happen, I would love nothing more than for it to have the same aesthetic and graphics of that Chamber of Secrets PS2 game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, hopefully this could spark some interesting discussion. I'd love to hear if anyone agrees or if you have different thoughts.

But I've just downloaded it and just some early notes on it :)
1. You have to download accompanying software separately 
2. But the premise is you find lost items, people or creatures (I first found Hagrid trapped in a spider web in my lounge room after shaking my phone for magic on the floor).

To free him, you line up your camera sight to the trapped character using a constellation on your screen.

Then once in place, a spell is performed and if successful, you can return Hagrid to something that resembles a sticker book. And it becomes clear you're on the hunt for various magical creatures or people that you add to your compendium. 

These 'Foundables' get harder to free and return to their rightful places. I had a unicorn which needed more wand and spell skill, so with experience and time you can level up your wand and magic to tackle the more difficult creatures. 

'Confoundables' are objects you have to remove in order to free the 'Foundables'

3. You can choose your house, customize and register your wand! 

4. There are daily tasks and events to earn rewards 

5. I've got some screenshots here if you're interested :)

Lycanthropy is a disease. And Rowling treats it like that. So many forms of media that feature vampires or werewolves show werewolves as like these creatures that sometimes have to go away when there's a full moon. Sure it's painful but it doesn't impact their lives in any other way aside from the fact that, whenever there's a full moon they gotta go. But in Harry Potter you can see Lupin getting weaker and more agitated. In the movie he's limping and struggling. Even having to take time off of class because of how bad he feels. It's not just some inconvenience, it is a disease.

&amp;#x200B;

I love that. It's such a good way of not only enhancing our world view but also shedding light on something that most people would think to be pretty great. At least i did. ""Once in awhile i transform into this super powerful creature of the night? Sign my ass up!"" But it's so much more then that. It's painful and irritating. You can see it and experience it. After watching Harry Potter i didn't wanna be a werewolf anymore. It just looks like suffering and it's supposed to.

1784,UltHamBro,1559493751,"\[*incoming wall of text, it didn't look so long when I wrote it, sorry*\]

I’ve been wondering things about the plot of the HP series for some time. We know for a fact that JK had the general plot of the seven books outlined from a very early point, but we also know that she changed things along the way, such as doing away with a character she had planned to include, and changing something in GoF because it caused a plot hole (lately, there was a theory which said it was Moody being a fake that changed, and I think it makes more sense than I first thought).

Also, I’ve seen some people complain about the Deathly Hallows being a late addition to the series and somewhat inconsistent. That said, we could argue that there is some very subtle, but almost undeniable foreshadowing in the first book, regarding Dumbledore having James’s cloak. I wouldn’t take this as a sign that the Hallows were completely thought out from the very beginning, but it does point at the Cloak being more than it seemed.

However, that got me thinking that the concept of Horcruxes might be a bit more problematic than the Hallows. It’s not just that they’re introduced quite late in the series, which they are: over time, I’ve also noticed some weird things regarding them. For instance:

* Diary Riddle is referred to as a memory throughout CoS, and his portrayal, powers and goals seem to be way different to what we’re told about Horcruxes later on.
* Also in CoS, Harry is flat out said to have a bit of Voldemort inside him, basically saying he’s a Horcrux four books before we know that Horcruxes exist, and five before Harry knows it. Also, Harry and Voldemort’s connection is given so much attention throught the series that, at the point Harry gets told about the Horcruxes, he could have immediately connected all the dots and figured it out himself.
* Once Voldemort comes back in GoF, he says that he doesn’t really know how he didn’t die, while he obviously knew. I personally find the wording to be a bit strange, because even if he wanted to keep the existence of his Horcruxes secret, I find it weird that he, being as proud as he was, would pretend being ignorant rather than just keep silent about it.
* I could even make a point that it doesn’t make much sense that a piece of Voldemort’s soul is in Limbo with Harry, since it shouldn’t exist once its Horcrux was destroyed, but admittedly, that’s a minor thing and may not have anything to do with this. Still, I wanted to say it nonetheless.

Most, if not all of those things can be explained away by headcanons and the like (I’ve done it myself several times), but it’s the sum of them that irks me. Of course, there are also hints that the general outcome of the Horcrux storyline was planned ahead, such as Dumbledore’s “gleam of something like triumph” when Harry told him that Voldemort had used his blood to come back, which was eventually explained as him realising that Harry might have a chance to survive after all.

All of this has made me form a theory: **in the original draft of the books, and possibly until well into the process of writing the series, Horcruxes as a concept didn’t exist**. The magic that protected Harry from Voldemort was so strong that a part of his soul became attached to Harry, and that saved him from dying. However, that was a one-time accident, and there were no other pieces of his soul inside different objects, nor was Harry intended to go on a quest to find them. Eventually, Harry would discover that the part of Voldemort inside him was the thing tethering him to the living world, and he would sacrifice himself to help defeat him, and likely be saved the same way he did in the final version of the books, thanks to Voldemort having come back using his blood.

I feel like this could explain the things I’ve said before: Diary Riddle was genuinely intended to be a memory and not a soul fragment, Voldemort really didn’t know why he didn’t die, and the final plot twist regarding Harry wouldn’t be that he had a bit of Voldemort in him (which he and we already knew), but that he was the reason why Voldemort had survived. Also, I feel like it could work better with the tone of the early books, where each one had a more self-contained story. It’s possible that, as the series progressed, JK wanted to give a more epic feel to the end of the series and decided to have Harry go in a quest (which, admittedly, was a good way to get him out of Hogwarts), thus reworking the idea of the soul fragment into the Horcruxes, and retroactively turning the Diary into one.

Of course, all of this could also be totally bogus, but I’ve enjoyed developing this theory. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

**Tl;dr: it's possible that Voldemort wasn't originally supposed to have Horcruxes, just one fragment of his soul inside Harry due to an accident. That could possibly explain why the concept of Horcruxes clashes a bit with books before they're introduced, while the overall plot could be more or less the same.**",harrypotter,Harry Potter and the Possible Original Plot regarding Horcruxes,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bvzbib/harry_potter_and_the_possible_original_plot/,1559464951.0

So, the wizarding schools all start from age 11, which means that up until that point there is no education for magical kiddos. Now I believe JK has mentioned that wizarding parents teach their kids all the normal stuff (how to do basic maths and literacy), and obviously muggle-born children are in regular primary education. But after that point what happens? Does everyone in the magical world have only an 11-year-olds education? If that is the case, how do the vast majority of wizards and witches speak with such eloquence? The general level of vocabulary from the characters (particularly the inner monologue of Harry) is of a well educated person. So how is this the case?

1807,Stopitimtired,1559461336,"Specifically Tony Stark and Remus Lupin.  I'm going to focus mostly on how these characters were killed off and why one wasn't exactly as satisfying and accepted to me and others while the other was generally more accepted.

 The first character is Tony Stark, the way they wrote his life before his death seemed to give solace to the audience and the character itself when they died through giving the character what they want after years of needing it while also mending broken relationships, allowing him genuine happiness for a few years before going out welcoming death in a heroic exit.

Now, Remus' character was going through a similar direction by giving him what he needed in life (even if he refused it initially, he still accepted it eventually) and building a new, happier path for him but the only difference here was how premature his death was compared to Tony. Yes, it was a war, and yes people die in wars, i am not denying that. 

However, if JK went through the same direction of Endgame and given everything Lupin wanted for a couple of years before dying a heroic death, instead of interrupting his happiness before eventually dying along with his wife. I think people (including me) wouldn't have had as much trouble accepting his sudden and off screen death. People would've said ""At least he lived happy for a couple of years"" instead of brushing off his death as shock value, pretending like it didn't happen or the most common ""He deserved better"". I even doubt Lupin's last moments weren't terrifying since Tonks also died and one of them had to see the other die first, all the while, keeping Teddy in the back of their minds. It's simply too angsty considering all of his life and how very little of it, he was actually content. If she killed off Arthur instead, i would've accepted more since he won't be that miserable guy who barely had anyone in his life, but a father with a loving family who will be there to take care after each other after his death. 

I guess what i am saying is, Lupin's death was definitely more realistic when you bring it out into the real world, but Tony's death is more accepted by people because there was a silver lining that went through all the way instead of just stopping midway. Lastly, i get that JK wanted to kill Teddy's parents to show the parallels between Harry growing up hated vs Teddy growing up loved, and honestly, i think that is barely the ONLY thing that makes me understand her decision in killing Lupin and Tonks.",harrypotter,Characters in HP vs Endgame,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bvv1le/characters_in_hp_vs_endgame/,1559432536.0

She was there when Dumbledore dropped Harry on the Dursleys doorstep. And she told him it was a bad idea. But did she check on Harry (whom she thought to be at least very unhappy there) even once?

1811,isn_it_isn_it_isn_it,1559448610,"I’m not a religious person at all.  If you pressed me on it I’d probably call myself an atheist.  But I realized recently that I read Harry Potter the way some people read the Bible: a little bit almost every day, as a source of comfort and guidance, and to help myself understand myself and other people better.

I also find a lot of my guiding principles in there.  Courage, standing up for what’s right, friendship, love, acceptance (myself and others) and the need, to a fault, to see the best in people.  I’ve had some of those values my whole life, but some were definitely instilled by HP.

Before we get all L Ron Hubbard about it, I’m not saying I believe it’s real, I obviously don’t (except in that “it’s real to us” way).  I also obviously wouldn’t *actually* call it my religion, because I can alienate people perfectly well already without adding on a made-up religion on top of my already weirdass personality, thank you very much.

But it seems like it does for me what actual religion does for a lot of people, except instead of Jesus and church it’s an imaginary wizard named Albus Dumbledore a bunch of weirdos on the Internet (in the best way).

Anyone else or am I way off the deep end here?",harrypotter,"I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out: Does Harry Potter feel almost like religion (in a really loose way, not trying to create Potterism over here) to anyone else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bvtli0/i_know_this_sounds_crazy_but_hear_me_out_does/,1559419810.0
1812,riversofchance,1559446786,"So, I won’t spoil anything outright plot wise , but I have some definite thoughts after seeing it. I’m posting this mainly as a way to help others decide if they should see it or not. Also, I was neutral to the book when I read it (I was unimpressed, but didn’t vehemently hate it.), so I feel I can judge it fairly. 

A) It was definitely meant to be a play and the script doesn’t fully encompass all of the dialogue. Like there are jokes and things that have been added. 
B) It is visually stunning, and the special effects are brilliant.  It was one of the coolest theatrical productions I have ever seen. The way they did the patronus charms was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. This is why it won a Tony. 
C)The father/child relationships are incredibly moving and nuanced. These are the emotional force of the play. 
D) Scorpio and Draco make the play. (Also Moaning Myrtle). The actors’ performances and their dialogue are best by far. Like Scorpio is actually a really awesome and like able character. 
E) Harry has some really f’d up PTSD. 
F)I expected the characters to be a bit different because they’ve had 20 years to grow as people, but Ron’s characterization took a weird turn to me. Like he basically acts like what I would expect Fred to have acted like had he lived. Like honestly, he’s more laughable than movie Ron was. But maybe, Ron fills Fred’s role with George more in the family than just with working at Wheezes, so that’s subjectable. I just would have liked for Ron to be a bit more nuanced. But then, Harry, Ginny and Albus are heavy characters so the lightheartedness is needed. 
G) Despite Ron’s character issues, his marriage/love for Hermione is adorable and shines!!!

Overall, I’m happy I saw it. The whole Delphi thing is really not the main focus until the end. It’s really about Harry’s relationship with his Albus and Draco’s relationship with Scorpius. If you’re really opposed to the plot, it may be hard for you to enjoy it. 

Again, I read the script when it came out, and I was unimpressed. However, you can’t judge a play without seeing it staged. I cried like 3 times tonight watching because it was that good. JK Rowling dug a whole for herself by opting to do a sequel in a format that most fans will never be able to access. 

Overall, I thought it was a stunning play. And the messages about fathers and their children is beautiful .

In the magic world, spells are everywhere. There is a spell for almost any situation, for your laundry or for tickling your friend. All these spells have been crafted carefully over the years, and many people have attempted to create their own with varied levels of success. 

This month, the professors have turned to the students, offering an award to the students with the best spells.

This EC is brought to you by Professors /u/calculost and /u/Macabregoblin!
___

##How it works:

You will be tasked with creating your own spell, it can be anything from a hex to a healing charm.

We require some base information, including it's common name, incantation, origin and description. There will be an example below with how to do this. 

----

**Spell Name**: Vanishing Spell

**Incantation**: *Evanesco*

**Origin/Entymology**:  The incantation ""Evanesco"" is a Latin word meaning ""vanish"" or ""disappear"".

**Description**: The Vanishing Spell is a Transfiguration spell used to vanish both animate and inanimate objects ""into non-being, which is to say, everything"". It is one of the most complicated spells taught at Ordinary Wizarding Level (OWLs).

It becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished; for instance, a snail, as an invertebrate, is rather simple, whereas the mouse, as a mammal, presents a great challenge. Certain objects can be enchanted to resist Vanishing Spells, such as fireworks or other prank items.

When you think of other characters who have gone through distress when they were children, they all grew up to be somewhat emotionally unstable. Snape has anger issues and is most of the time emotionally detached. Lupin panics. Sirius rebelled. Nevill was insecure. Even Ron, who had a stable house and a loving family had trouble and was insecure. Now, I haven’t read the books for some while, but from what I recall, he lacked that significant element in his character and when it appeared (because the neglect did cause effects on him) it was brief and not in depth as others characters, which is, i think, is somewhat unrealistic. I don’t know, i just find it odd how he was pretty intact after all those years with Dursleys... i know I wouldn’t be. But i guess it’s a children’s book after all and people cope in different ways. And again, I haven’t really read the books in a while so maybe i missed something.",harrypotter,Harry as a character,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bvj24a/harry_as_a_character/,1559352812.0
1875,StonedandProud,1559377955,"So I'm on a marathon watching all the Harry Potter movies in order (Which should take me over 19 hours. Wish me luck!) Anyways, I got to the goblet of fire and I began to wonder to myself. Why do the wizards feel the need to hide themselves  from muggles? For that matter, why do a lot of them look down on muggles? I mean granted you have good wizards like Dumbledore and Arthur Weasley who like them but nearly everywhere I look in this world there's this huge stigma against muggles, wizards that come from non magical families are bullied and ridiculed, and you can even get into trouble for revealing yourself to muggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, Why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you imagine how many problems that muggles face in the real world can be solved if the wizards shared their magic?

&amp;#x200B;

The Herbivicus Charm could be used to grow plants in non-fertile soil which will help those in third world countries affected by hunger.

&amp;#x200B;

The medicine developed by Wizards could be used to save lives. I mean think about it, if they can wave a wand and mend a bone in seconds then I don't think it's too far fetched to think that it can do something like treat cancer or some shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Alohamora spell could be used by wizard locksmiths in case a muggle gets locked out of their car or house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wizards could even become law enforcers and use magic to protect the innocent with spells like Expelliarmus and Stupefy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The list goes on and on. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why do wizards dislike muggles? They're just people trying to live their lives the same as wizards do. I can kinda understand that they don't want Muggles using magic for evil. But that happens all the time anyways without muggles around. You got characters like Gilderoy Lockhart, Dolores Umbridge, Lucius Malfoy, and Peter Pettigrew. All of which were either evil or corrupted. So saying that they should fear muggles using magic makes no sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly can't think of a real good reason why Muggles and Wizards need to be separate.",harrypotter,What's the deal with Wizards and Muggles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bvip70/whats_the_deal_with_wizards_and_muggles/,1559349155.0

I'll save you the time because It's #2 Tl'Dr at the bottom

I am fed up with people hating on others for their different views on the HP Relationships just because they don't agree. The Most Common Is Harmony (Harry and Hermione). People for some reason hate the small (albeit vocal) group of people who want Harry and Hermione to end up together. I just don't get it??? Why Hate On The Idea. I, myself am part of this group even though I don't mind Ron and Hermione. If You Don't Like Other People's Opinions then you shouldn't be on this subreddit (which is all about Opinions and Discussions about Harry Potter). I also see a few people on this sub get downvoted like hell when they say ""I Want Harry And Hermione To End Up Together"". Another group of Shippers as I like to call them that get a lot of hate is the ""Harry and Ginny"" group (and yes I know they are actually together). They are the ones who like Harry and Ginny getting together. I don't have a problem with them but ofc there are a lot of people who do. They also get a lot of hate for no apparent reason other than they like Harry and Ginny as a couple. And then there is the last large group the ""Ron and Hermione"" group (again I know they are together). These are mainly the ones that are spreading hate. I don't have a problem with like 80% of them who just state their opinion and make jokes on the other ships (not hating) but the other 20% is the problem. They (for some reason) REALLY like to bring people who like other couples down. I would just like them to stop that's it.

TL'DR: I am really upset that so many people are hating on others for liking different relationships (or possible outcomes)

But let's take the facts:

* The password to the Slytherin common room when *Slytherin's* monster was on the loose, threatening muggle-born students was ""pure blood"". I can't emphasize how reprehensible that really is.

* Almost no one at the Slytherin table raised a glass to Harry Potter at the end of Goblet of Fire, who had just warned the world about Voldemort's return.

* McGonagall tells Slughorn it's time for Slytherin House to choose what side they're on before the Battle of Hogwarts, because obviously it's a huge question all the rest of the teachers and houses have.

1915,Ronald_McGonagall,1559332127,"So let's get this straight for starters: I thought the Deathly Hollows were a neat plot point.  In particular, I liked how they were the reason for looking into Dumbledore's past, one of the most interesting parts of the books.  They were, however, a pointless distraction to the main plot of hunting horcruxes: the ring being a hollow and horcrux was happenstance and nothing would have changed if it were only a horcrux, and the cloak being a hollow didn't even seem to affect the plot as it is, rather just being a neat piece of history. But this rant is about the wand.

To begin with, let's look at my own personal opinions on the mechanics of wand allegiances.  I've always liked HP for its *internal* consistency but this was one place it didn't do it for me.  So the Elder Wand is a really powerful wand made for a powerful wizard, and transfers ownership when the current owner is killer.  Ok, I'm on board so far.  But sometimes it can also transfer ownership when the owner is magically disarmed with an extremely basic spell that the students learn in first year.  This is where I began to get suspicious, as one would think the all-powerful wand would be a little more selective than ""can my master do this simple spell?"".  But I suppose its magically disarming someone, so I'll accept it^1.  But then apparently it can also transfer allegiance when an altogether *different* wand is taken from the owner without magical interference?  That's where my squint of skepticism became a full on eye roll of disbelief, because it just seems like such a reach to try and make Harry the owner by the end.  Since I don't believe she came up with this plot point at the very end of writing, just in time to include it, it always bothered me that she didn't have the whole thing take place in a much more consistent way that didn't involve questionably special circumstances for Harry -- even Olivander said he couldn't explain wand allegiances very well, essentially a way of saying, ""I can make this work however I want as I go and just say it's shrouded in mystery"".  This, in particular, is why I believe it was a lazy bit of writing, and it's contrived nature ultimately being how Harry had an advantage makes it a deus ex machina.

The next point of discussion is the more factual aspect of ""wand allegiances"" being altogether unnecessary.  To claim it was necessary would be to claim that without the concept of wand allegiances, Harry could not have defeated Voldemort, the ultimate goal.  This manifests itself in the idea that Voldemort using the Elder Wand which was loyal to Harry was the reason Harry was able to defeat him, which is why Dumbledore gifted him the stone and book in his will (written, obviously, before the night he died).  But since Harry only came into ""ownership"" of the wand through the kerfuffle at Malfoy Manor, a further unpredictable extension of Dumbledore being disarmed by Malfoy, Dumbledore couldn't have known Harry would ever come into the wand's possession -- Harry himself doesn't even realize this until afterward, so it wouldn't have been reasonable to expect him to figure it out in time either.  What if, for instance, Harry only realized after, but *hadn't* happened to have stolen Malfoy's wand earlier?  This is a supportive argument, but ultimately a moot point because Dumbledore actually planned to bring the wand to the grave with him, ending its lineage altogether.  Therefore, if the defeat of Voldemort hinged on the wand being in Voldemort's possession but Harry's ownership, then Dumbledore either could not plan that this would be the situation in the end, or actively planned for it not to be so.  Since we can be confident that Dumbledore was not planning on establishing a situation where only Voldemort could win, it follows that all the wand allegiance nonsense was *not* the deciding factor in having Harry win, and was thus altogether unnecessary.

One might now argue that, hey, it gave Harry an advantage with the way it turned out and even if the wand's allegiance had lain with Voldemort, it would have been useful to have the heads up.  While this seems reasonable, why then wouldn't Dumbledore simply have mentioned to Harry one night, ""oh, btw, if I die for whatever reason, Voldemort is going to go on a hunt for the all-powerful wand, which I own.""?  It comes down to the fact that any advantage you can associate with having either ownership, possession or even knowledge of the wand could have easily been handled in a single chapter any time in the previous year.  And if it was critical or important info, since Dumbledore knew he was dying within a year and that Malfoy (and by extension, Snape) had been tasked with killing him you'd think he'd prioritize telling Harry while he still could.  Pretty much everything about the way Dumbledore handled the situation makes it clear that he had deemed everything about the wand, down to even knowing about it, as unnecessary to the task at hand.

As I said, I liked the hollows plot, but I think the whole thing would have been much better had it been explained in the 6th book, then had the end of the 6th and 7th dedicated just to ~~camping and~~ horcruxes. Eliminating wand allegiances altogether would clearly not have affected the outcome of the story, would have cleaned it up a lot more and wouldn't have made the final win feel like a lazy deux ex machina.

^1 Rowling has addressed why, then, every member of the DA who practiced disarming still had loyal wands, saying that allegiances wouldn't change in competitive, practice or otherwise non-serious scenarios, but that then means that when the trio simultaneously disarmed Snape in what was a very serious situation in the Shrieking Shack in PoA, Snape's wand wouldn't have been his after that",harrypotter,Wand allegiances were a lazy and unnecessary deus ex machina: a rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bvc1hp/wand_allegiances_were_a_lazy_and_unnecessary_deus/,1559303327.0

&amp;#x200B;

Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,

Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,

One among us seven will let you move ahead, 

Another will transport the drinker back instead,

Two among our number hold only nettle wine,

Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.

Choose, unless you wish to stay here forever more,

To help you in you choice, we give you these clues four:

First, however slyly the poison tries to hide

You will always find some one nettle wine's left side;

Second, different are those who stand at either end, 

But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;

Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,

Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;

Fourth, the second left and the second on the right

1929,thewhitebrucewayne,1559312352,"It’s explained in HBP that any spell cast in the vicinity of an underage wizard will trigger the trace, and make it appear to the ministry that the underage wizard was the one who cast said spell. A perfect example of this is in COS when Dobby uses a hover charm at Privet Drive and Harry is blamed for it. 

So why didn’t the ministry seize every chance they had to make Harry look even worse (that was their goal) by slapping him with multiple charges of underage magic? They could have charged him with the packing spell that Tonks uses in Harry’s bedroom, or the disillusionment charm Moody puts on Harry. Somehow I don’t think they would have bought or approved of Dumbledore saying “Sorry I sent a bunch of Aurors to pick Harry up and they were the ones doing those spells so you can’t charge him for that.” Especially since the Ministry was trying to discredit Dumbledore as well. Plus Dumbledore could’ve just said, “oh yeah that was someone I sent to keep watch over Harry who cast that patronus, it wasn’t actually Harry himself.”

1964,DeCrazyGrill,1559258844,"There at King's Cross, where you can smell the deep scent of coffee and hear rushed footsteps along the way, is home to Platform 9 and 3 quarters, the station for the Hogwarts Express to take them to Hogwarts. The trio walked through the wall and a black-and-red train puffing with steam met their eyes. It was  filled with wizards/witches in black robes, saying their last goodbyes to their parents. They smiled at the sight of this and went on the train after giving Mr. and Mrs. Weasley another humongous hug. Ginny, Luna and Neville were sitting in an compartment with Percy, as he decided to spend more time with his sister and not apparate. Harry, Hermione and Ron, although, weren't that lucky. Sure, at last they found an empty compartment, but it wasn't the seats which were covered with dust nor the window that had been scribbled on. It was who the compartment was next to.

""Look, the trolley witch's here. Want me to go get something for you guys?""

'Thanks Harry, I'll have some Bertie Bott's""

""How 'bout you, mate?""

""Y'know, the usual, some chocolate frogs, pumpkin pasties, and chocolate cauldrons.""

""You do realize that that'll cost 2 galleons and 7 sickles?, Ronald?""

""Nah, it's okay, I've got loads more.""

Harry pushed open the door of the compartment and to his shock, there stood Draco Malfoy, hands full of gleaming gold and silver.

""Watch where you're going, *Potter!*""

""Why don't you?""

Draco pulled out his wand, but Harry came prepared. He quickly yelled ""Expelliarmus!"" and Draco's wand flew out of his hand, landing in another Slytherin's hands.

""You're lucky you have an ally with you,"" said Harry as the Slytherin gave Draco his wand.

The trolley witch came down the corridor and Harry used it as an excuse to get away from him. He couldn't help but notice his hair was more shiny than before. Wait-NO! What the heck! He is *not* a stalker, nor gay! He'd *never* fall for Draco! After what he'd done? ***NEVER. EVER.*** 

""Dude, you okay?""

Harry then realized that he'd been red in the face and that he was sweating.

""No, I'm ok-""

1966,Aniel928,1559258580,"So i'm going to Universal Orlando next week for the first time ever (yay, super excited!! Grew up with these books, now I'm 32 and have read them like 50+ times, no exaggeration, so excited to be going!).  I only have one day in the park, and it's a Saturday.  I'm going alone (husband has a different event in Orlando on the same day, plus he has no interest in HP at all), but I still got an express pass because I only have the one day and it will probably be crazy busy.  I just have a few questions for anyone more experienced with the park:

I'm currently loosely planning: 

* Start in Hogsmeade at Forbidden Journey (I have an express pass, but based on my research, this is really the only line that is worth waiting in, except maybe Gringotts, but between the two, this one.)
* Explore a little bit of Hogsmeade, but really mostly save for later.
* Take the Hogwarts Express to Diagon Alley.
* Do the Gringotts ride (if the lines aren't out of control, i can wait in the queue for this one too, but otherwise I'll skip it and maybe go back later if there's time to wait in line).
* Get a wand (I hear this is better to do later in the day).
* Explore the Diagon Alley side of the park ad nauseam (including Knockturn Alley, etc.)
* Take the Hogwarts Express back to Hogsmeade and explore that park ad nauseam.
* (Keeping my fingers crossed for a soft open of the new Hagrid ride in there somewhere)

I guess my major questions are:

1. I'm purposely trying to wait to get the wand so that I a.) don't have to deal with lockers for Gringotts and Forbidden Journey, and b.) it's less crowded at the wand shop.  Will it really save any time doing this? Will I regret this?
2. I hear there is a wand place (with show and selection) on both sides, is Diagon Alley the better of the two?
3. If I decide to bring like a fanny pack with like sunscreen and sunglasses, can I wear that on the two rides or will they make me put that in a locker?
4. If I'm not staying in a Universal hotel, can I still buy stuff and not have to carry it around and pick it up when I leave all in one place?
5. Any other tips for going by yourself as a 30-something?",harrypotter,Universal Trip: One Day - What order should I do it in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bv02aa/universal_trip_one_day_what_order_should_i_do_it/,1559229780.0

1970,IntenseIcecream123,1559255887,"So sorry this is long but I can't figure out my hogwarts house. Ever since I got into Harry Potter a few years ago I've seen myself as a Hufflepuff because I'm caring, humble, hardworking, loyal, dedicated - and I'm naturally kind and help others. However my little sister (a proud Slytherin) sees me in Slytherin (although everyone else I know would say I'm Hufflepuff), and ever since she first told me I should be Slytherin I've noticed how passionate, determined, resourceful, clever and ambitious I can be, although I don't crave power. So because I value and possess Hufflepuff and Slytherin traits almost evenly I cannot decide. I've taken the pottermore test multiple times and mostly get Hufflepuff, with Slytherin a few times. I also took the full pottermore test and got Hufflepuff. But if I were eleven years old at Hogwarts I feel I would be Hufflepuff because as a little kid I was very shy, kind and didn't possess a single Slytherin trait. But because my best friend and little sister (both Slytherin) are so important to me I'd want to be in the same house as them. So I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure if it helps but my zodiac sign is Scorpio and my mbti type is INFP. And this is probably irrelevant but my favorite Harry Potter character is Snape, the character who I feel most sympathy for.",harrypotter,Hogwarts House?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/buzkz3/hogwarts_house/,1559227087.0

1973,SeasonofCrows,1559252649," The nostalgia was almost overwhelming as I read through the first four chapters of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* this afternoon. It’s been quite some time since I’ve opened the pages and joined The Golden Trio at the Three Broomsticks, sipping a butterbeer. Too long. So the time has come once again. This time, however, I thought it best to ask some questions and start a discussion regarding some things I come across in my reading, which I’ve listed below. If you haven’t read the series before, I suggest **not** reading on, as there’s plenty of spoilers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Within the first chapter, we come across Minerva McGonagall, as first described by Vernon Dursley, Harry’s rather distasteful uncle. He crosses paths with McGonagall twice before we’re really introduced to her, as her first appearance is as a cat. This is her Animagus form, which is a spell that allows witches and wizards to transform into animals of their choosing. It’s a complicated spell and not every witch or wizard has an Animagi form. We’re given the hint that this cat that Dursley sees is the same due to the markings around her eyes. !&lt;

&gt;&gt;!“As he \[Dursley\] pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw...was the tabby cat...He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.”!&lt;

&gt;!When Dumbledore appears, he also notices McGonagall and addresses her firstly as a cat. Her description addresses the markings, clarifying they’re replaced by her glasses. !&lt;

&gt;&gt;!“...he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.”!&lt;

&gt;!It can be deduced without question that if one was to know McGonagall’s Animagus form, she’d be easily identifiable. My question is, is this the case for every Animagi form? From my knowledge of past readings, we’re made aware of several other witches and wizards who are able to take animal forms, but as far as I can remember, the only other one we’re given a more exact description of is of Rita Skeeter’s, and I believe she had distinctive markings too. !&lt;

&gt;!Another question of mine to do with the markings around McGonagall’s eyes to represent her glasses is to they have significance? If she is in need of glasses to see, does her vision improve as a cat? Or does it stay the same, and, instead of it looking silly that a cat is wearing glasses, do the markings just disguise them and provide the same visual aid that she needs? !&lt;

&gt;&gt;!“A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching...and its eyes narrowed.”!&lt;

&gt;!Does the narrowed eyes mean she’s focusing to see if this is who she’s been waiting for? Or do they narrow to demonstrate her focusing? !&lt;

&gt;!This is just one of the questions I’ve developed so far, but to keep from overloading both myself and anyone reading, I’ll stop here. I’ve posted this on my Tumblr as well. !&lt;",harrypotter,Revisiting the Wizarding World,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/buyzp3/revisiting_the_wizarding_world/,1559223849.0

She was very protected from being touched- Percival fought some muggles off merely touching Ariana which many autistic people feel uncomfortable when it happens.

She was a late developer- Her learning of magic was slow and uncontrollable and some people on the spectrum have learning difficulties.

1994,Butthead2002,1559243978,"When people say they hated Dolores Umbridge from the series, it's always for ""the right reasons.""  Stephen King even went so far as to compare her to Hannibal Lecter.  Honestly, when you really think about it, she should be hated for how poorly written she was.

First off, the conflict with her was a huge roadblock in the over all narrative.  Hell, it was a roadblock in just Order of the Phoenix.  It's like JK Rowling didn't think Harry having dreams where he sees what Voldemort sees and learns about a prophecy was a compelling enough story, so she threw in a really mean teacher who has no connection to Voldemort whatsoever. It made OOTP really boring when I read it.

Second, she's a one-dimensional straw man.  She's basically the bastard child of George W. Bush and Margaret Thatcher. Let's see here: a huge tragedy befalls Hogwarts, so the Ministry of Magic uses it as an excuse to force Hogwarts to trade freedom for protection, and anybody who steps out of line gets tortured.   Totally not a commentary on the Patriot Act and Gitmo at all.

Third, she doesn't even try to hide how evil she is.  She makes it clear during Harry's trial that she has it out for him for now reason.  She gleefully makes students cut themselves, and they don't think to show the scars to anybody of higher authority.  She even bullies the teachers and terminates any she doesn't like.  Christ, how many children does this woman have to mutilate before Fudge realizes that she's human filth and sends her to Azkaban?  Then again, it's Order of the Phoenix.  The characters were playing Hot Potato with the Idiot Ball.  The really insulting part about all this is that the book treats it like it's a huge reveal that she was responsible for the Dementor Incident.  Really?  The woman who works a job that potentially gives her access to the Dementors, had been the antagonist of most of the book, openly hates Harry's guts, looks for any excuse to make his life hell, and was really looking forward to him getting expelled was actually responsible for an incident that almost got Harry expelled?

It was a terrible idea. They had probably got nothing out of him. He'd hate him forever.

2025,KuraiKage666,1559190703,"This is something that's for Fanfiction purposes but at the same time an interesting concept that's occurred to me. At the time, everyone was focused on the Elder Wand and we were so used to the Invisibility Cloak, we never truly went in depth of the stone. 
As we all know, each of the Hallows held a certain trait that even in the magical world, is hard to recreate. The problem is each one comes with a particularly deadly consequence.
From its ability, it can be perceived as one of the most beneficial of the Hallows, and the most dangerous out of the three.
Here's the reasons:

Beneficial:
The stone, as we all know has the ability to call loved ones from the dead. However it doesn't truly bring people back to life, rather it calls and allows the user to communicate with their spirits. The only true benefit one would find by using the stone is to find closure and acceptance if your loved one died in a freak accident, or was brutally murdered, as it can even be used to help victims identity the killer.

Why it's Dangerous:
Now this is only speculation, so as far as canon I can't say for certain. While there are those who would use the stone for the above reasons, again the spirits summoned by it don't like to be called from their afterlife. Despite that, I don't doubt there are those who would be seduced and tempted by its power to the point they would abuse it. As a result, while strong feelings of love would make the spirit happy to return, continuously tethering them to the world of the living and in a sense, keeping them prisoner would most likely cause them become more unhinged and desperate to return.
In the Tale of Beetle the Bard, the 2nd brother's fiance was at first happy to be back, but soon grew miserable over time, leading to his suicide. 
But say the fiance asked to return and brother ignored her and kept her bound, the desperation of wishing to return to her afterlife would eventually force her to kill him by any means, and breaking the hold on him and the stone.

Years later, I eventually start thinking I should finish the Harry Potter books, even though I know he dies in the end.

I’m going through changes and figured— at the very least— that Sirius’s death would be disorienting, considering how my dad’s cancer has progressed and could similarly take him “[beyond] the veil.” 
 
In fact, I have been far more significantly impacted by Harry’s thought process surrounding his own emotions. Put plainly, I’m shook because I recognize my reality when he acknowledges his ugly thoughts and feels guilty afterwards. I’ve had outbursts towards loved ones who genuinely wanted to help. I’ve felt completely and utterly alone thanks to my experiences, and even though they’re far less unique than Harry’s it still fucking sucks to sit in a room of your peers and think (even if it’s wrong) that nobody could possibly know how you feel. 
 
(But then, you’d never meet Luna if you kept to that mindset, would you?)

2050,RaineyDazezDraws,1559162666,"Greetings! Welcome to a NEW yet AWESOME community RolePlay in an alternate universe in the magical world where Dumbledore decides to keep Tom Riddle close to him during the war.

&amp;#x200B;

This Server has currently four dedicated staff members who are on daily, and are constantly holding plot events. Each staff member is a leader of some sort in the war efforts, so member assimilation is simple and easy after character creation.

&amp;#x200B;

We start our story in the year 1975, in the time when the Marauders still wreaked havoc in Hogwarts and a world where Grindelwald remains undefeated by Dumbledore. (Marauder characters are still available :) )

Out of fear of Tom falling into Grindelwald’s hands, Dumbledore helps secure Tom’s position in as the new DADA Professor. This kept Tom in a place where Dumbledore could keep a good eye on him and far away from Grindlewald’s exposure.

Tom still has plans to change the world in his image, but his plans have adapted to succeed where he knows the dark lord will fail.

It is only a matter of time.

There is a timeline that is consistently updated, for your viewing pleasure to make joining simple and easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Choose your side! or not, your choice.

(“DARK”) Grindelwald is the current Dark Lord. Usual dark art supremacy/freedom/pureblood propaganda.

(“GREY”) Tom Riddle is a Chaotic Neutral option in the war, has a smaller following as he is the current DADA professor at Hogwarts. Tom will have the potential to go either way in the war effort but, as always, he will just do what benefits him more.

(“NEUTRAL”) A small following of people who refuse to choose a side, despite the appeal it will limit who and how you can interact with people, despite lack of sides.

(“GOVERNMENT/POLITICALLY MINDED”) You’re in it for you, you won’t care sides, only benefit, really it sometimes comes to who pays you better…

(“LIGHT”) Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Pheonix, you fight for justice and equality for everyone, dark arts who needs those.

You may start from the first year, attend classes and grow as an individual or you can come up with an entire life story start whenever (older teen student or not, adult, elder your choice.) You can be staff at the school, or you could be in a village far off making plans of wicked attack. There is no rule you have to be a student, you could just live your magical life outside the main drama. You have freedom of character creation so long as it's feasible within the universes universal rules, creatures are welcome outside of the student body due to ministry regulations.

&amp;#x200B;

Please keep in mind, this is a mature server, so please only apply if you are 18+, Violence and other themes are explored lightly, thus the age restriction is firm.

This Role Play is happening during a great time of change in the magical world, can your characters survive the upcoming battles?

Since this server is AU, OC’ s and ANY HP era characters are welcome as long as you have a backstory as to why they belong in that era without the use of time travel.

Watching Deathly Hallows Part 2 and reimagining the book in my head. Just so I have this straight --- When Harry opens the snitch right before entering the forest clearing, effectively destroying the 2nd to last horcrux (himself), he discovers the Resurrection Stone. So essentially, he is the ultimate master of death in this moment, correct? He had had the invisibility cloak since he was 11, had gained control of the elder wand earlier in Deathly Hallows, and now ""discovered"" the Resurrection Stone (even though he'd technically had it in his possession since early on in Deathly Hallows as well).

The part that gets me, is that he could have walked into the clearing without dropping the Resurrection Stone and been virtually indestructible; however, if he had done that, Voldemort could not have destroyed his own horcrux, which would have made them both ""invincible"", thus fulfilling the prophecy that ""neither could live while the other survives"" because Harry and Voldemort would have no quality of life whatsoever.

Not to mention the fact that Harry was a fucking horcrux the whole time and virtually indestructible to anyone BUT Voldemort, so every time we thought he was in peril there was absolutely NO chance of him actually dying in the first place.

#What is Werewolf?

HogwartsWerewolves is a game similar to Mafia/Ultimate Werewolf but played on an internet forum. A new game is hosted each month by a variety of game facilitators. Sign ups open on the 25th of each preceding month. Once signups end, you will receive your role and any relevant information via PM, and you will have 24 hours to confirm that you still plan to play. All game play will take place on the game sub. New players cannot join a game once it starts, but have to wait for the following month. The theme, roles, and gameplay may vary each month as the facilitator chooses, but the premise remains the same: an evil team attacks the good team at night and the good team tries to lynch evil team members during the day. Only living players can actively participate in the game threads. There is an accompanying private subreddit, /r/HogwartsGhosts, that players are added to as they die to freely discuss the game.

If you have ever played **Town of Salem,** it is a very similar concept.

#Where and how is this played?

Each month at /r/HogwartsWerewolves, a new game is run by a new set of hosts. This month we will be playing one giant game, but don't let that throw you off - the theme is *A Game of Ice and Fire* and so everyone will be divided into three or more kingdoms, or ""minigames"" to start. Fewer players to keep track of means it will be easier to follow along. So if you've been thinking about joining but have held yourself back, now is the time! 

[Here is the rules post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/bt379t/a_game_of_ice_and_fire_rules_and_roles/) This game will be hosted by /u/dawnphoenix (me!) and /u/tipsyGlassQuill.


#What sort of time commitment is this?

Every game has minimum activity requirements. This means that you must be able to pop online for *at least* five minutes every day to submit the lynch/activity forms. If you cannot meet these activity requirements, please wait to play until there is a month that you can.

Aside from the activity requirements, Werewolf is what you make of it. You can skim the top comments on your phone before submitting your actions, or you can keep extensive notes on specific phrasing or behaviors. 

***[Sign up for the game through this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFr6W6TfNGaG1qJjXXf5jYpfzdgYwRyGyFNMVWiYlJpAfFZA/viewform).*** Once signups have ended, you'll receive your role information via PM.

2081,jsktrogdor,1559115946,"The quill punishment Umbridge inflicts on Harry in that chapter ***should*** completely shock the reader out of their suspension of disbelief.  It's such an insane escalation of violence from a children's story.  The tone of Umbridge's character just *explodes* from a nosy bureaucrat into a full-blown child abuser.   The shift is so jarring it really should break the story.  The reader at that point really should be angrily demanding the author answer ""HOW COULD THIS OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE POSSIBLY CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AT ALBUS DUMBLEDORE'S SCHOOL!?""  But the way Rowling lays out Harry's mind, how she paints this picture of a 15 year old's confusion and shame after being victimized like that.  And *why* he's keeping it a secret... it's *really* well conceived:

&gt;'How was detention with Umbridge, anyway?  
&gt;  
&gt;What did she make you do?’  
&gt;  
&gt;Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, ‘Lines.’  
&gt;  
&gt;‘That’s not too bad, then, eh?’ said Ron.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘Nope,’ said Harry.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;‘At least it’s only lines,’ said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment, really ...’  
&gt;  
&gt;Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge’s room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face.  
&gt;  
&gt;He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.

It reminded me of this last season of Game of Thrones (I know, everyone's sick of hearing about it).  That was a situation where even when the characters were making choices that *should've* made sense for them, it still felt jarring because the writers failed to build that out.  Then you look at this chapter from Order of the Phoenix and it *just fits.*  You read it and instantly you think:  It makes perfect sense that this character would chose to keep this awful abuse a secret, even though it *should* make no sense at all.",harrypotter,"""Detention With Dolores"" is a really compelling perspective on how some victims of abuse chose to keep it a secret.",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bubruu/detention_with_dolores_is_a_really_compelling/,1559087146.0
2084,katesartspace,1559112347,"On Pottermore, it says some interesting things about how to determine what animal form your Patronus will take.
The Patronus represents that which is hidden. Unknown but necessary within the personality.
According to the wizard Catullus Spangle:
""A person confronted with inhuman evil, such as the Dementor, must draw upon resources he or she may never have needed, and the Patronus is the awakened secret self that lies dormant until needed, but which must now be brought to light.""On Pottermore, it says some interesting things about how to determine what animal form your Patronus will take.
The Patronus represents that which is hidden. Unknown but necessary within the personality.
According to the wizard Catullus Spangle:
""A person confronted with inhuman evil, such as the Dementor, must draw upon resources he or she may never have needed, and the Patronus is the awakened secret self that lies dormant until needed, but which must now be brought to light.""
Determining my own Patronus:
I am not a social person. I enjoy hiding in my room, away from everyone else, as much as possible. I'm afraid to do any activity that involves even the slightest possibility of me getting hurt, and I hate hate hate heights. Again, because of my strong self preservation instinct that refuses to even let me do the simplest things.
So with that in mind, my Patronus form would need to have qualities that are opposite of those. My ""hidden secret self"" would be something that is forced to give up those fears in order to constantly, and effectively, face them.
Let's start with the most common Patronuses: dogs, cats, and horses.
Cats are extremely adaptable. They can jump, climb, and can twist around to land on their feet even after falling from great heights. Even better? They're pretty much completely indifferent to everything going on around them. If they want attention, they will let you know. When they're done with you, they will definitely let you know that too.
Dogs are the complete opposite. They love people. They crave attention. They're active and sociable and can even be trained to rescue people in need. My exact opposite, but domesticated dogs don't exactly have the survival instinct needed to survive inhumane evil.
Now, let's talk horses. They are social animals as well, and they can even get lonely. They are also capable of defending themselves in unexpected ways when threatened. Perhaps, like, say, when confronted with an unexpected evil?
But those are just the most common possibilities. There are billions of animal species, and determining which one might be my Patronus will be practically impossible. But we can narrow it down a bit.
In the article ""Patronus Charm"" on Pottermore, the wizard Catullus Spangle notes that some wizards have the unique ability to cast a Patronus that takes the form of their favorite animal. He writes: ""It is my firm belief that such a Patronus is an indicator of obsession or eccentricity. Here is a wizard who may not be able to hide their essential self in common life, who may, indeed, parade tendencies that others might prefer to conceal.""
I am definitely a person who obsesses. I have an addictive personality, and I will take any opportunity to discuss what interests me and continue to beat that dead horse until somebody stops me.
My favorite animal is also the cat, one of the most common Patronuses. So, case closed?
Well, being unafraid to discuss your obsessions may be considered a bit eccentric, but again, I am not a social person, and only when someone else displays interest in a favorite topic of mine do I engage. So no, I do not think that would be considered eccentric as this article describes it.
Later in the article, Rowling writes: ""It is usual, but not inevitable, for a Patronus to take the form of an animal commonly found in the caster's native country.""
Unfortunately for me, that country is the United States. But politics aside, there are many animals commonly found all over the place here. But, what if we narrowed it down to the animals ONLY common in America?
Unfortunately, that's pretty tough too, because the numbers are larger than you might realize. According to currentresults.com, the number of vertebrate animals include:
428 mammal species
784 bird species
311 reptile species
295 amphibian species
1,154 species of fish
So is that it? Will I never know what my true Patronus is? Perhaps, but there may be another way.
""The hidden secret self that lies dormant until needed."" The traits one doesn't use until the most desperate situations arise, may be the key. So, let's list the traits I do have and the traits I would need to have to survive in side by side columns.

shy - well, shy and social animals can both survive well in the wild
night owl - nocturnal hunting is actually a good strategy
picky eater - will eat anything that can fit into its mouth
fear of heights - ability to fly/climb
I prefer warmth over cold - can survive in both hot and cold climates

Now let's see which animals fit those categories.
Well, most of them. But again, let's start at the most common: cats.
They're nocturnal and they can climb, but they are very picky eaters and are not exactly the most social animals.
Wild cats, on the other hand, are much more adaptable. So let's start with tigers.
Tigers hunt alone, at night, and eat a variety of different meat.
Lions, are very strategic hunters, and can take down prey much larger than themselves by clamping down on the neck until it dies.
Now, the Lynx. According to Brittanica.com: ""Lynx live alone or in small groups. They climb and swim well and feed on birds and small mammals."" The fur grows more dense in the winter and less so in the summer. The Canadian lynx even has feet that act like snowshoes.
So, the Lynx. It's adaptable. They swim, they climb. They eat lots of different stuff. They can even walk on top of the snow. These cats are built for survival. All of these traits are things I would never normally need to use, but which I do have, and would need to ""bring to light"" to survive.
I honestly think, if I could cast a Patronus, the Lynx (or maybe even a common cat, which do have very similar behavior) would be it's corporeal form. But the quiz on Pottermore may or may not say the same thing, because you can get different questions each time. But I'll try it anyway, see what I get.
Well, fuck. My Patronus, according to Pottermore, is a dapple gray mare. Beautiful horses. My favorite breed, even. But not at all what I expected.

But when i say antagonist of HP, i don't think of him as someone like Voldemort who wants to commit genocide, i think of him as someone who has seen how awful people can be to the point of pure resentment, that he wouldn't bat an eye if the world crashed and burned in front of him. I know that doesn't really sound like him at all, but i just think that it's actually incredible how he is so forgiving and lacks of any bitterness even though he always was one of the victims in kind of situation. He really is a character that is often overlooked, but has an immense sense of guilt and compassion that he actually teaches you the essence of the HP series of love and redemption.

(a.k.a listening to the audio books and watching the 80's TV show) and I love to sort different characters in to Hogwarts houses, weather or not they have any relation to the series. however Anne has been the hardest person i'v ever sorted. there have always been characters that seem like they could fit into any house (Dumbledore, Mcgonagall etc.) but Anne tops them all.

My first thought was Ravenclaw because of her love of literature &amp; learning and her vivid imagination  &amp; creativity. but her temper isn't a very Ravenclaw trait, Ravenclaws tend to look a problems with a logical mindset and try not to get swept up in their emotions so often.

So the next house I looked at was Hufflepuff. the reason why I saw hufflepuff in her was because of her drive to belong somewhere and to have a ""kindred spirit."" This a main reason for her love of reading, she reads stories to detach herself from her miserable life and imagine a better one. she even creates an imaginary friend when shes lonely, Katie. but she also holds grudges with people while most hufflepuffs are excepting of everyone, sometimes to a fault.

the third house that I thought of was Gryffindor, mostly because of her fiery temper. holding grudges is also a Gryffindor trait . She can be implosive and reckless, this is what tends to get her in trouble so much. in fact her character arc in the first book is to learn to let go, that holding grudges can lead to guilt and regret. shes also stubborn, which goes hand in hand with holding grudges. but I still feel as though with all her other traits that fit in to other houses she doesn't scream Gryffinndor. her talkative nature especially isn't very Gryffindor.

the last house she could fit into is Slytherin, this is mostly because of her ambition to beat Gilbert at everything and her unwillingness to admit her feelings. she also has a tortured backstory that Slytherins so often do. but I feel as though she is to kindhearted to be a Slytherin. not that Slytherins are always evil, but I just don't think they would refuse to whip a student if they were being a jerk.",harrypotter,Sorting Anne of Green Gables,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bu7rfw/sorting_anne_of_green_gables/,1559060391.0

Based off what I read in the books it seems as though she considers Hagrid to be next in line to take the title. The reason I believe this is at the end of HBP she calls all heads of house to meet in her office and replaces Snape with Slughorn and also invites Hagrid. Although she never directly mentions the fact that he is to sit in her place as the new head of house it would only make sense as when Dumbledore took the office he replaced himself as head of Gryffindor with Mcgonagall.

2119,BigTimeDogs,1559075352,"Mostly everyone talks about how scarily accurate Crouch Jr. portrayed the real Moody, and how it's strange that every character basically accepts the actual Moody, including Harry, after spending the entire year with an impostor. Now, if you were to ask me to guess who put Harry's name in the Goblet before it is revealed, I would never had guessed that the boy who was practically begging his father to hear him out, that he was innocent in the Longbottoms tortures, to have been the culprit. And I'm assuming that no other Potter fan would have guessed this as well (unless you were one of the few who did guess correctly. If you did, then please tell how you guessed right).

It is known that the GOF had to be rewritten halfway through the process, thanks to a plothole that Rowling found. Now we don't have much information on what the plothole was. All we can go by is what Rowling has said herself in an interview back when GOF was first released:

&gt;The first three books, my plan never failed me. But I should have put that plot under a microscope. I wrote what I thought was half the book, and ”Ack!” Huge gaping hole in the middle of the plot. I missed my deadline by two months.

In the same interview she mentions that the plothole had to do with pulling a Weasley cousin from a story, who basically had the same function as Rita Skeeter. Now this seems to solve the plothole problem, except for the whole Moody plot twist. 

The thing is, once finding out that Moody was an impostor the entire time, it does seem to be thrown in last minute once you get to think about it, especially since only a few key lines could possibly give Crouch Jr.'s position away, such as ""If there's anything I hate more, it's a Death Eater who walked away free."" And the fact that Crouch Jr. in the Pensieve is drastically different from the one that is revealed in the end of the book. He basically turns from being an innocent boy, begging his release, to relishing in the fact that he had helped bring Voldemort back to form.

Which leads me to believe that Crouch Jr. wasn't an originally planned character, or had been only limited to the Pensieve scene before getting promoted to top bad guy. The Pensieve scene and the moment where Sirius Black mentions Crouch Senior threw his own son in Azkaban, could have easily been written to show just how ruthless Senior is, and show how not all people who fight against Death Eaters are saints.

**Where does Moody come into all of this?**

As for Moody, I'm led to believe that either he was supposed to be himself the entire time, or the Pettigrew was to be the original impostor. Why Pettigrew? Because he was already introduced the last book and had escaped back to Voldemort. It wouldn't have been hard to believe that he could pull this off after tricking everyone into thinking Sirius had betrayed the Potters for 12 years. 

The problem that arises from this, though, is the Marauder's Map. Once Harry takes a peek at it, he would see Pettigrew instead of Snape in the Potion Store, and boom! Caught red-handed. That is why Crouch Jr. was created, or promoted to bad guy.

If Crouch Jr. had been originally created for the Pensieve scene, then he could've had another name. All Rowling would have to do is change his O.G. name to Barty, and since the Map doesn't distinguish titles such as Junior, Senior, etc., it made an easy route for Harry to mistake the culprit as Senior in the Potions Store.

And then, maybe the big rewrite comes into Chapter 9, The Dark Mark. This is the the basic meat of the entire Crouch storyline. This is where the the hints and pieces can be picked up that something is off about Senior and Winky, from Winky ""struggling to run, as though something was holding her back,"" to Senior looking gaunt and pale after coming back from the forest, having just, as we know, discovered Junior underneath the invisibility cloak on the ground. Not to mention the question as to who sent the Dark Mark up to begin with.

**What about Crouch Jr.'s character afterwards?**

I know that some people wonder why the Crouches are rarely ever mentioned again in later books, especially since Percy talked highly of Senior during GOF not to mention Sirius's story of him.

Now, Senior can be excused, because you know, he's dead. But what about Junior? The main catalyst for returning Voldemort back to his body? 

He received the Dementor's Kiss not only because he was too powerful breaking free of the Imperius Curse, and plotting the entire Tournament, but he was nothing more than a means to fill out the greater plot of the story. Therefore, he was no longer needed when Bellatrix filled his role in the later books.",harrypotter,Was Barty Crouch Junior's character added at the last second?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bu53av/was_barty_crouch_juniors_character_added_at_the/,1559046552.0

Me, my two younger sister, my cousins and my mom were staying at my nan's house. My nan lives in Tipton a small town in Dudley, UK. She lives next to a large woodland area which is only a steep hill. The only way in there is through my nan's garden. Behind the woods is a train track. 

Me, cousin 2 who was only 5 and half months older than me and cousin 3 who is 3 years younger than me; were playing a game which involves us pretending to be rocks. As we were the only one downstairs we could play in a larger area and for it to be more quiet. We used blankets as rocks, this was our home. If we saw another one move we were meant to fight them. We decided to all jump from under the blankets at the same time. We did and we saw something which haunts us three til this day....

What we saw was a figure which looked like a dementor from Harry Potter and the black hooded monster from Bridge to Terabithia. It came out of nowhere and ran across the back garden. We all freaked out and asked each other if we saw that. When we all said yes. We freaked out again and ran upstairs. The thing could not have run into the front garden and have left as many people would have seen it and we would have seen it. It could also not go into the woods as the trees are so close together and the slope is too steep and finally the door would have locked if he entered!
All three of us ran upstairs screaming. We explained to my mum and she said it was because we were under blankets.

The series has huge popularity, critical acclaim as well as commercial success all over the world. The series is often considered to be the cornerstones of modern young adult literature. The series has also had its share of criticism, such as concern about the increasingly dark tone with the series’ progression, as well as the scary violence scenes it portrays. It has been more than 20 years since the first book of the series has been published, but it still has not lost its topicality. Furthermore, it continues to be so popular that the author continues to extend Harry Potter world with movies like “[Fantastic Beasts and where to find them”.](https://www.pottermore.com/fantastic-beasts)Along with the younger Potterheads, Harry Potter series have attracted a wide adult audience as well.

""Harry, are you ready?""

""I am, but check upstairs if there's someone we missed.""

""Argh, Ronald...""

""I'm coming! Just getting my books...""

There was a huge thump and it felt like the ceiling would fall on them. A brief moment later, a familiar-faced redhead came down the stairs, struggling to hold on to the huge luggage.

""Mate, you need help?""

""Nah, I'm fine...Honestly, Hermione, why do we still have to go to Hogwarts?""

""We've talked about this, Ron! Hrry wants to be an Auror and are you honestly gonna let him be alone in Hogwarts?""

""But he's got you! Besides, we've already defeated Voldemort any-""

""Guys, we're gonna be late, it's 10:45. Just stop arguing, ok?""

""I still don't see the point in going back to Hogwarts if Malfoy's gonna be there.""

""So is Parkinson, Ron. Everybody has to re-attend Hogwarts because of the lack of actual education they got last year.""

""C'mon, the car's here.""

A light blue Ford Anglia came into the driveway. Harry and Ron looked at each other and smiled. Inside of the car were Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and Percy.

""Percy, what're you doing here?""

""I've got to go to Hogwarts for a thorough inspection, y'know,""

""Oooh, I like your new haircut, Percy.""

""Don't mention it, Hermione.

While Hermione and Ron talked about Hogwarts, Mrs. Weasley came over to Harry and squeezed him in a tight hug.

'Oh Harry dear, alright?""

""Yes, Mrs. Weasley, thank you.""

Mrs. Weasley then hugs both Ron and Hermione. Percy looked down, as though something had struck him very tragically. Everybody knows what it was, but they didn't have the heart to say it out loud.

""Percy, it's not your fault.""

""It bloody is. If I hadn't been joking so much, he'd have paid attention.""

Tiny, clear droplets started to form in his eyes, but nobody knew what to say. His voice sounded as though, choked. Mrs. Weasley gives Percy a hug, then everybody starts to hug him. Ginny was the last to join, and not long after, she said:

""Guys, we're nearly gonna be late!""

Mr. Weasley hurries to drive, before shouting ""Everybody ready?""

""They all nod, and Arthur shoots up the driveway.

To me, they were integral to Book 7's plot (obviously, since they are in the title) and our learning of them helps to explain some of the past events in the HP storyline (Harry's cloak, why Snape killed Dumbledore, etc), but I feel like they are too celebrated for a concept never even mentioned by name until the last book. I mean they are literally our up/down vote symbols, not to mention how they find their way on loads of HP memorabilia or seemingly are involved in about half the tattoo posts on here! Some symbols I feel better represent the HP universe would be Harry/s scar or glasses, owls and wands, Hogwarts houses (which we use a lot), broomsticks, The Sorting Hat, etc

2208,HellaShaggy,1558942009," Hello Reddit :)   
My friends and I have made a new Harry Potter RP Discord server. We’ve worked hard to set it up and we’ve done our best to outfit it to our Rpers personal interests and entertainment.  
We excitedly bring you interesting RP possibilities.  
\~ Any race considered a being and capable of magic may attend our school. New races that are lore friendly may be applied for but these are entirely staff discretion.  
\~ The basic familiar list is expanded to other types of bird outside owls including ravens, crows, bluejays, etc etc. As well as some species of lizard being allowed. Rich students (Typically purebloods) may bring exotic pets right off the bat. Should a student capture something small like a bowtruckle and prove capable of caring for it they may keep it as a familiar.  
\~ We have our own sport original in performance but perhaps not idea to our server. Ild kamp, Fire Fight. I won’t spoil too much before you join. But I will say this. It includes everybody’s favorite Scandinavian beast from the books.  
Come and join us. Become part of our community, and part of the family. Come have fun with friends, maybe make some new friends, and enjoy your time.

2209,JayGrainger9,1558941396,"We have the 7 books from Harry's perspective as the narrator, and I know a lot of fans want more of the other main characters perspective on the events of the books. So, I think doing 7 books in the same style GRRM wrote the GoT books would be great. Each chapter is narrated by a different character, so you see the story as it goes through multiple eyes. We wouldn't have Harry as one of the narrators because we already have his POV, but it would be fun to go through the minds of Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Draco, and others to get more of the story. This would also allow for us to know what actually went on at Hogwarts during the 7th book, and allow us to know what other characters where up to when Harry wasn't the center of our attention.",harrypotter,Rewrite HP in the style that A Song of Ice and Fire (GoT) is written,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/btizr7/rewrite_hp_in_the_style_that_a_song_of_ice_and/,1558912596.0

2217,getoutmyway98,1558931119,"As a film series, it’s MILES better than the Potter film series was, two installments in. Sorry, MILES, and from a standpoint of craftsmanship, it marks a high point for the series, as has been said by multiple film critics. I think we need to reconsider, for example, our thoughts on Philosopher’s Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Order of the Phoenix if we’re seriously acting like fucking CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD is a low point. My fuck. 

I like the Fantastic Beasts series because they’re much more complex. They confront taboo themes in interesting and mature ways. It allows Rowling’s world-building to shine, and its not boringly confined to one location. It detailed and far more artistically and thematically ambitious. It’s complex, whereas Harry Potter was WAY too simplistic and boring, at least in film form. 

The more I consider the criticism of the Fantastic Beasts series, the more I’m seeing how non-fans are dominating the narrative surrounding it. There are 3 videos a day from a bunch of random YouTube accounts that previously never posted *shit* about Harry Potter that all of a sudden have an opinion on an installment of the franchise. 

And please, I followed the discourse surrounding both FB films before they opened. After FB1, despite the positive reviews, there was a huge amount of shit-slinging and nit-picking for absolutely no reason, with relatively shallow and outright poorly constructed criticisms that clearly stemmed from people’s lack of understanding of the plot. 

For example: 

“IT WAS JUST ABOUT FINDING CREATURES. It was boring!”

Well, no, it wasn’t, and it obviously wasn’t, so I really do not have time to even entertain this criticism. The entire film was about Grindelwald attacking NYC with the Obscurus, Credence Barebone, in an effort to expose the Wizarding community. The beasts were a cover for that effort, as they explicitly stated in the dialogue. 

But these people didn’t care about that, they wanted to maintain *their* version of the story, simply to justify their reductive view that this series “wasn’t important/was childish/was too simplistic” (and I heard another people say that the film was “too simple/low-stakes”.) Well, all of a sudden, these people sit down for Crimes of Grindelwald, and are *gasp* SHOCKED to find out that the series is *gasp* COMPLEX. And DARK. And features said OBSCURUS trying to discover who he is amidst the manipulation of the ensemble cast of characters, that draws them all to the rally held by Grindelwald, in which they chose sides. 

The frustration and therefore the negativity that some people feel toward the film is somewhat understandable, as it functions like a part two and does not, therefore, close or develop *all* if it’s characters and narrative strands to the fullest extent. But the superlatively negative lashing that the film has received is so obviously burdened with pre-determined hatred and Potter-haters just willing failure on the series that I can’t remotely entertain the constant aggressive proselytizing about how “THE FILM SUCKS, AND YOU SHOULD THINK IT DOES TOO”. 

Look, there’s ALWAYS objectivity in entertainment and in film criticism in particular, but when you reach such extremes and preach such hyperbole about a film being “the worst film of a series/the month/the year”, (or, alternately, the “best film ever”), you need to provide valid arguments and justification to back that statement up, and simply no one has when it comes to Crimes of Grindelwald. 

There are SOME things worth criticizing, such as the fast-and-loose editing and the insufficient running time, and, again, I understand some people’s frustration with how incomplete some of it feels due to the serialized nature of this 5-part story, but these are *little* criticisms at best, and constant, rote, cliché accusations and imputations of “plot holes!” and “bad writing!”, or insistences that the series is just rotten to the core and needs to simplify itself/“change the entire overarching narrative” for you to like it are such lame, low-effort, highly-personal, ignorant criticisms, and they just do not cut it, and provide no solid base on which to place such grandiose accusations of the film franchise being “trash”, or even just “poorly made”. 

This, on top of the outrageous amount of unwarranted controversy and abuse Rowling got before the film came out, as well as the snide, dismissive treatment the film got for absolute no reason at all from members of the entertainment media (mocking the title of the film, getting mad that the film ended up on “most anticipated movies of the fall season” polls, or insisting that it would fail at the box office) sort of drives home that the bulk of the criticism around the film, and the negative hyperbole, just isn’t warranted at all. 

It looks like a bunch of non-fans and haters jumping at the chance/formulating excuses to trash a successful franchise. 

And when all else fails, this franchise is already a billion dollars rich. CoG improved upon the overseas performance of the original. The original film was positively reviewed. The audience response, while more lukewarm than usual, was decent as indicated by IMDb, Google, RT, CinemaScore, and Metacritic, and the franchise has already earned itself an Oscar and a BAFTA. CoG was nominated for a BAFTA and numerous guild awards. The fact that people are jumping at the bit to classify the franchise a failure on top of all this just demonstrates that the “criticism” is irrational and forced.",harrypotter,"Opinion/Rant: Fantastic Beasts (as a film series) is better than the Harry Potter series (as a film series), and the hatred it gets is largely blind and pre-determined",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bthlik/opinionrant_fantastic_beasts_as_a_film_series_is/,1558902319.0
2218,macklin67,1558931047,"I think Dumbledore was wrong when he told Harry in HBP that Voldemort intended to create his last horcrux with the death of Harry in 1981. That doesn't make any sense to me. One of the first things McGonagall says at the start of SS is that people have been living in fear for 11 years. Voldemort being as superstitious as he is wouldn't be at the height of his power for 11 years without having all his horcruxes. In 81, he had himself, the Ring, Diary, Locket, Cup, and Diadem. Nagini wasn't recruited until about the time of his return, so that's 6. Add a mystery horcrux I call H7, that makes 7 pieces in total.
If we look at both the book text and the movies, the weakened Voldy looks very similar in both the graveyard in GF and in not-kings-cross station at the end of DH. I think it's pretty evident that the Voldy we see in the graveyard in GF was somehow extracted from the horcrux H7. With H7 essentially destroyed, we're back to 6 pieces (as far as Voldemort knows). And what does Voldemort do as soon as he has enough strength? Horcruxify Nagini to again total 7 pieces.
Maybe H7 was actually some artifact of Gryffindor to complete the set, but it was the easiest to access, especially for Wormtail, a former Gryffindor.

2220,Shykila,1558927822,"So I’ve just rewatched TDH pt1/2. I just can’t help but feel respect for Narcissa Malfoy, she was not a death eater. Her sister was and so was her husband. She then had to watch her son be emotionally broken into the world of death eaters too. Draco proved time and time again that he wasn’t truly a bad soul (if he wasn’t trying to prove himself to his father to be the fierce, heartless persona that even his dad truly wasn’t, he could have been an actually nice person). She had more strength and devotion than both her son and husband put together. Just the unbreakable promise with Snape proves she did everything she could to be a good mother even though she didn’t align with her husband, sister and friend circle. 
So there’s a true account of the long debated Slytherin traits before they are tainted with darkness loyal, smart, strong and brave. 
Godric and Salazar were close friends and a Gryffindor would have held all those traits important. 
Technically the Slytherins hold those traits to the Dark lord, they just misplaced them in evil. 
The true Slytherins fear the dark lord and know they’ve made a mistake but still devote themselves. 
The plain evil followers use the dark lord as an excuse to carry out acts of violence to sate their own desires.

I wonder if this just part and parcel with becoming older and more miserable as life goes on. Or perhaps I was always a Slytherin inside? 

The question is, do you think the world has slowly corrupted me into being a cynical, sly person, and over time we all just deteriorate into worse people? Or am I completely overthinking it and should just embrace my new Slytherin identity? 

There must be some good Slytherin role models out there, but even non dark wizard Slytherins weren't great.

2302,TheRedCoatNeedsAWash,1558865291,"So i've recently been listening to the Harry Potter audio books after first reading the books 8 years ago. I've also been rewatching the films and reading this sub and it's gotten me thinking...

&amp;#x200B;

I know there has previously been discussion on how the Sorting Hat knows which house to sort you in e.g. on your values. But most of what we know from the sorting hat is from what it tells us in it's songs:

'*’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.'*

*'There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see'*

'*I sort you into Houses Because that is what I’m for, But this year I’ll go further,'*

So from the above we know the Sorting Hat is very clever (or thinks it is), can see everything inside your head and can prophesise the further (if you consider its warning a prophecy).

So my theory is that the Sorting Hat sorts you into the house that matches your life's most defining action.

It can see in your head your potential future life, sees your most defining action and which quality this is and creates a self fulfilling prophecy by sorting you into that house and making you therefore value that quality the most.

For example, I believe the most defining moment in Neville's life is killing Nagini, and this showed bravery.

Snape you could argue was really a brave hero so why wasn't he in Gryffindor? He only switched to the 'good' side for his own selfish reasons and creepy love of Lily. It wasn't out of true bravery or loyalty

James in Gryffindor even tho we was a bit of an arrogant wanker at school? His defining moment was being brave standing up to Voldemort.

Peter in Gryffindor as his defining moment was helping Harry.

Draco in Slytherin as his defining moment was, in my opinion, his actions in HBP, as his family regaining status is his main motivation.

Your teenage years are some of your most important for brain development so I think as being in your Hogwarts House becomes such a large part of your identity in these years the qualities associated with your house define you.

We've seen self fulfilling prophecies before with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which Voldemort fulfils by hearing it and trying to kill Harry.  And you could argue many events wouldn't have been able to happen if the hat hadn't sorted students the way it had. E.g. if Hermione had been sorted into Ravenclaw would Harry and Ron been able to defeat Voldemort? Also the maurders being sorted together, death eaters being sorted together etc.

To take it a bit further I believe the Sorting Hat considered putting Harry in Slytherin partly because of Voldermort's soul fragment, but also because it could see Harry owning all 3 of the Hallows, and it had to decide whether Harry would use this selfishly to take power, or if he would use them for good. Once Harry asked to be in Gryffindor the sorting hat knew Harry would use the Hallows for good (I also have another theory that Harry is the only true owner of the Elder Wand that could potentially overcome the whole Wandlore slight plot hole thing)

So in conclusion I believe the Sorting Hat has divination powers and creates a self fulfilling prophecy for each student based on the most important action of their life. Of course this sometimes fails and a student goes against their 'destiny' such as Regulus Black, however for most students their house quality will become a major part of their identity therefore shaping their lives and futures.",harrypotter,Theory on the Sorting Hat and Prophecies,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bt6a4u/theory_on_the_sorting_hat_and_prophecies/,1558836491.0
2303,EatingLikeAFatKing,1558863789,"There are many legitimate arguments showcasing just how ruthless Albus really was.

I want to focus on one. Snape.

The popular question is why is such a terrible person is even allowed to teach the students. He clearly doesn’t like kids, and clearly doesn’t treat them right. 

Why would Dumbledore allow this? He had no choice.

In the moment Snape begged Dumbledore to save Lily’s life - Dumbledore, ever the opportunist, asked what Snape would do for him.

😂

So cold. Honestly. That’s cold, methodical, ruthless af. And when Snape said anything, Dumbledore knew Snape was his ace. He needed Snape at Hogwarts, not bc he wanted him there, but bc he needed to make sure Snape wouldn’t bolt on the agreement.

Someone as miserable as Snape probably tried to get away. But Dumbledore couldn’t let him. And so Snape lashed out at the most innocent - the students.

Dumbledore trapped him there.

Doesn't that sound an awful lot like Hermoine? She's the ultimate bookworm, yet she's always helping those in need like Neville or Ginny, and never asking for anything in return.

I’ve always had a soft spot for Filch, probably helped along by his portrayal in the movies. David Bradley did a fantastic job. But it seems to me that Filch, a minor but very much present character throughout the series, is almost entirely insignificant. Besides catching Harry in the halls after hours and being Umbridge’s crony, his whole character seems irrelevant. 

And yet, he’s not in the same league as very minor characters like - I don’t know - Professor Flitwick. Filch is a character everyone knows, but it seems he does next to nothing meaningful in the whole series. Why is he there? One would expect that JK would’ve woven him into some integral action that shaped the story, like so many other minor characters, but I can’t find that moment. Is there one, or is Filch totally inconsequential? Is he there to teach us what a Squib is? Provide comic relief? Maybe his purpose is just to be another antagonistic character to Harry, posing minor inconveniences throughout the series, but that’s kind of lame.

“If you don’t stop squirming I’m going to have to tie you to this table, miss Granger” Snape drawled, and Hermione nearly came just from the sound of his voice. How had she never noticed how sexy professor Snape’s voice was?

She couldn’t take the teasing anymore. Blindly she groped for his fly.

“Shut up, and use your wand, professor. Or I will have to report you.”

With a short chuckle Snape undid his fly and belt, pulled down his trousers, parted her underwear to the side and with a powerful thrust he was inside of her. Hermione threw her head back and moaned loudly.

“Excellent use of your wand, sir.”
“Shut up, Granger”, he panted and started thrusting, bending down to kiss her at the same time. Hermione moaned into his mouth and grabbed his shoulders for leverage. She felt like she had never been so full in her life. Every time he thrust into her he hit her g-spot perfectly, sending her closer to the edge. She was just about to come crashing down when she heard something that almost made her heart stop. Ron was somewhere outside the classroom, shouting her name.

“Professor”, she gasped, trying to get his attention, but just in that second Snape came with a deep grunt, releasing deep inside of her. If she hadn’t been so terrified of Ron walking in any second she would have taken time to enjoy it.

“Professor, I think Ron is outside looking for me, can you hear him?”

Snape looked up from the crook of her neck, listening intently. He cursed under his breath, and swiftly pulled out of her, making her wince from the sudden loss. He tucked himself in, and wandlessly dressed himself. Within seconds he was standing there fully dressed as if nothing had happened, while she was still on the bench with her legs spread. She quickly closed them, suddenly embarrassed about the situation they found themselves in.

“I’ll go out and distract him while you, ah, get yourself decent”, he whispered, clearly not making eye contact with her. She blushed furiously as he strode out of the classroom.

“Oy, Snape”, Hermione heard Ron shout as Snape opened the door. “Have you seen Hermione?”

“As a matter of fact, I have”, she heard Snape answer. “She told me to give you her regards.”

There was a crack and a loud thud, and then silence. Without thinking Hermione ran for the door, only to find Ron unconscious outside, and Snape nowhere in sight. Ron already had a black eye that was swelling up by the second.

She couldn’t help but smile as she dropped Ron’s wand on top of him, then walked away.",harrypotter,Professor Snape was a bad person,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bsy8ae/professor_snape_was_a_bad_person/,1558782487.0

I used to think that harry potter was an orphan who was adopted by a nice husband and wife  named the Malone's whom he called his aunt and uncle. One day while playing in the park on a rainy day he sees something in the forest, and harry walks in the forest to find the ghost of his mother and father and they tell him that  he's a wizard and he must go to Hufflepuff(Hogwarts) for his schooling, and harry agrees and gose to Hufflepuff  where he meets two new friends named Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy ( yes, before I read the books I thought Draco Malfoy was a good guy because my cousin who already read harry potter before me said he was one of her favorite characters and I thought why would he be her favorite character if he wasn't good.) and then a ceremony called the sorting happens where you get sorted into one of the four house's; Gryffindor: must be strong/ hogssmeed(Hufflepuff): must be kind/ Slytherin: must be good-hearted/Ravenclaw: must be pretty to get in.  
together the three get sorted into Gryffindor and one night they go into the forest and when confronted by spiders, Ron runs into a hut and which harry and Draco follow him into the hut and in there they find a girl from a tribe from the woods called muggles. They soon find out this girls name is Hermione Granger and the take her back to Hufflepuff and she become a wizard too. A few years later Voldemort try's to kill harry and instead kills Voldemort and then there is a happy ending.

In the movies, her prowess at intimidation is downgraded to her smacking Ron and Harry around and whining/cajoling at them. Very rarely does she shock them into submission using body language or words. Its almost ALWAYS a smack. One of the few times she acts like book Hermione is when she orders Ron and Harry to bed at the end of the Yule Ball, and it just seems out of character in the film, because she so rarely expresses her domineering nature that way.

I just hate it for 2 reasons; a) smacking people is a very bad means of conflict resolution, and honestly it's just abusive and not charming, and b) it does a disservice to her powerful force of personality.

The following are excerpts surrounding his studies of the nature of dementors and the mechanism by which basilisk eyes petrify their victims... Any feedback and revealing of plot holes/inconsistencies is much appreciated, feel free to add any ideas you may have too.  And my grammar is atrocius and im too lazy to edit...

**ON THE DISCOVERY OF A DEMENTOR LURE**

A dementors effects cannot be completely staved off.  But they can be resisted through muggle technology to the point where studying them will not place the scientist into a state of existential crisis.

Enchanted seretonin and dopamine were discovered to function as a dementor “lure” of sorts.  The mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, but the following procedure achieved success in bending the foul creatures to our will. 

Begin by first isolating highly pure sources of human extracted seretonin and dopamine  (dementors will not respond to seretonin and dopamine harvested from non human animals, this was one of the main reasons they could not detect Sirius black in animagus form) 

placing this extraction in a highly concentrated and as of yet classified gelatinous suspension, infused with theobromine (one of the main ingredients in chocolate) and blasting this concoction with repeated blasts of the patronus charm under standard temperature and pressure creates an elixir which renders the dementors compliant and eager to do the bidding of whomever possesses a vial of the elixir.  

It should be noted that not just any patronus charm will do. The patronus must be cast by a sufficiently powerful wizard picked by the sorting hat to the house of slytherin by virtue of the fact that the wizards power level was measured by the hat to be 700 necrojoules or higher.  

Necrojoules being the unit of measurement discovered by Camus plume to correlate with the amount of “dark” wizarding energy wizards were innately born with.   The opposite being vivijoules.  Every wizard has magical energy that can be measured in vivijoules or necrojoules, meaning every wizard can potentially turn to the dark arts if they so choose, however only wizards of sufficient necrojoules can become extremely powerful dark wizards.  

The cutoff point for how many necrojoules a wizard must posses to be able to become an extremely powerful dark wizard is not yet known but it is known that no extremely powerful dark wizard has ever possessed a necrojoule level of less than 600.   

Lord Voldemort, in fear that a situation very much like the incident with the boy who lived may have occurred before his initial downfall made a prodigious store of his blood and instructed one of his faithful servants who was able to infiltrate st mungos to secrete it in one of the blood banks of wizard blood they kept there for transfusions.   

Voldemort also kept a meticulous store of blood, as well as skin hair and saliva of his death eaters for various purposes, the most important of which was to have the ability to create polyjuice potions for any of his death eaters.  In this way, a death eater knew that he could be framed for any number of crimes if they chose to betray the dark lord. 

 Camus plume discovered these stores of blood and body solids/fluids and measured the necrojoule values of lord voldemort and his death eaters.  Voldemort, not surprisingly, had the highest necrojoule value of any dark wizard ever tested and currently remains the only dark wizard to achieve a necrojoule value exceeding 1000, he also had a vivijoule value exceeding 900.  Interestingly severus snape had a relatively low necrojoule value of 650. 

The values of all of the dark lords death eaters will be included in an upcoming brief.  needless to say these are matters of the highest classification and are deemed top secret at the highest levels.  Any individual releasing this information to wizards or muggles alike will be prosecuted for high treason.  

**On the properties of the Basilisk Eye**

Upon discovering the petrifying qualities of indirect basilisk gaze exposure, the military set about isolating what confers this petrifying effect.  The exact effect is not yet completely understood but it has been discovered that the gaze must be held for a period of time ranging from one to three seconds.  Persons with different genetic makeup seem to display a sort of resistance to the petrifying effect, but as of yet, no individual has displayed complete immunity to basilisk gaze.  

In a series of extremely unethical tests which almost certainly violate the nuremberg codes dictates on human experimentation, Camus Reggy Plume, the first muggle to ever fashion a working wand from completely unmagical means, collaborated with the us governments (MUM) (muggle understanding of magic) department and took persons of both muggle and magical descent of every conceivable background and subjected them to rounds of basilisk gaze of both the direct and indirect kind.   This resulted in 500 individuals dying as a result of direct basilisk gaze and 2000 individuals being petrified against their will and experimented on before being resuscitated via the mandrake method.

Persons of every known racial background as well as persons of mixed racial background were walked into a 10 X 10 foot room manacled and blindfolded, and then subjected to the gaze of a surgically removed basilisk eye.

It appears that the basilisk gaze is not effective in anything other than the visible spectrum of light. This was established by muggle advances In technologies for restoring the sight to to the blind, the us military found itself in the habit of trawling orphanages and “adopting” blind children, who were then secreted away to military facilities and fashioned with a state of the art retinal gene therapy that made the child’s eyes unable to see light on the visible spectrum, but able to perfectly see light of the infrared and ultraviolet variety.  

These children were then subjected to the gaze of the basilisk to no effect.   

A peculiar thing happened when the basilisks, (who now numbered in the thousands due to the government breeding programs) saw for the first time ever that what they fixed their terrible gaze upon didn’t immediately die or become petrified.  They became relatively pliant, docile, and for all intents and purposes domesticated, but only to the individuals that received the gene therapy.  

Similar protection against the basilisk gaze was achieved via outfitting individuals with temporary basilisk gaze immunity by wearing infrared or ultraviolet goggles, but the basilisks would not enter into a placid docile state for these individuals....",harrypotter,Tried my hand at some fan fiction maybe you guys will like,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bsko47/tried_my_hand_at_some_fan_fiction_maybe_you_guys/,1558695017.0

Ginny ends up with the person she obsessed over when she was a child and she has some striking similarities to Harry’s mother. and she basically goes from a shy little sister who can't do anything right to ""I'm good at everything and also so good looking it's crazy"" without actually explained in the books other than Hermione talking about it for a few moments. This just seems cheesy and perhaps even unhealthy. Rowling also admitted that pairing Ron and Hermione was mostly her own wish fulfillment and that she is not entirely happy with it now.

now this is in the past, let's focus on the current timeline of our life (this was just me finding the ending of the books kinda weird)

suddenly Dumbledore is Gay and the author refuses to name Heromione as white because... I don't know, maybe it might anger some people who consider her to be black? and if I recall it correctly, despite her never writing that Heromione is white, it was clearly stated a couple of times that she had pale skin. now this never bothered anyone until the SJW movement took over the Media like a storm and ever since this has been making a lot of people angry. if someone wants to believe something then sure, enjoy. but the author of the books shouldn't start pandering to groups, because that play she made was bad enough. to a point where actual fans are angry about her making stuff up out of nowhere despite never even hinting about it. like say Nagini being a human being at one point in time. and you know she couldn't be played by a white actress because diversity (this is just me questioning stuff, I don't really care one way or the other) turning our beloved longbottom into a murderer (apparently)

to this day every time someone tells me ""well here's a plot hole for you"", I google it and find a good answer. Harry potter books are not exactly mind blowing, they are light hearted with a good message and amazing for children and adults alike. back in the day they did their job well to inspire many people to be better, and simply fall in love with this world. it's the way that JK rowling have been acting suddenly when these social justice angry feminists movements have risen, is making it harder for many fans to not feel betrayed.

so... I wanted to hear your opinion about it. it is also important to note, that when I write angry feminist I actually mean an angry feminist. twitter feminists are not real feminist, a real feminist is in Africa right now feeding children and making the world a better place by changing rules to help everyone, without viewing men as a shameful existence and trying to control everything (that is ofc a subject for another time)",harrypotter,what do real harry potter fans think about JK rowling recent behavior?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bshr6z/what_do_real_harry_potter_fans_think_about_jk/,1558680189.0

Sorcerer's Stone - He gets knocked out by the stone chess figure towards the end of the book and needs to be rescued by Hermoine when she heads back through the trap door to fetch Dumbledore.

Chamber of Secrets - He gets trapped by a cascading rock wall towards the end of the book and is left to shift rock to clear a path with a very confused Professor Lockhart for Harry, who saves the day alone.

Prisoner of Azkaban - His leg becomes broken by Sirius while he's fighting to control Scabbers and he needs rescuing by Harry and Hermoine in the Shrieking Shack. To add insult to injury, his pet rat of 12 years knocked him out cold with his own wand, meaning Ron never played a key part in rescuing Sirious and he never got to experience time traveling.

Goblet of Fire - Not even mentioning his absenteeism during one of the most tumultuos times of Harry's life, Ron again needs saving when McGonagall and Dumbledore bewitch him, Hermoine, Cho and Fleur's sister during the 2nd task of the Triwizard Tournament.

Order of the Phoenix - One of the Death Eaters hits Ron with a curse in the Ministry of Magic which causes him to become mentally unstable and unaware of his surroundings. He becomes another cause of worry for Harry when the brain attacks Ron and he has to draw the Death Eaters away from him by running alone with the prophecy.

Half Blood Prince - Ron decides to eat a dozen cauldron cakes for breakfast which causes Harry to need to rescue him from the effects of Romilda Vane's love potion. Then he nearly dies from the poisoned mead in Slughorn's office and Harry again needs to save his life with the bezoar.

2547,RonSwanson4POTUS,1558624392,"So been re-reading OotP and started thinking more ""behind the scenes"" of what we learn in the books from Harry's perspective. A couple details in particular stood out to me, and as far as I can tell, I have not seen it mentioned anywhere else before. Ran it by a couple of my friends who are also huge HP fans who hadn't really made the connection before either, so mostly just curious if anyone else has had this realization. Apologies in advance for the wall of text, but without further ado...

&amp;#x200B;

I had always assumed that Voldemort become aware on his own that he and Harry were connected enough that Harry could see into Voldemort's mind, but I think it was actually Kreacher that made him aware. When Harry and the Weasleys return to Grimmauld Place after Harry's ""vision"" of Mr. Weasley being attacked by Nagini, Kreacher would have overheard that Harry was able to see into Voldemort's mind and mentioned this to the Malfoy's after Sirius told him to ""get out"". Thus, the plotting begins to use this to Voldemort's advantage, and I suspect Snape might have been looped into the plot which he immediately told Dumbledore about and that's when Snape and Dumbledore decide to teach Harry occlumency, because they \*know, rather than suspect, Voldemort will be luring Harry to the Ministry to retrieve the prophecy. Naturally, Dumbledore and Snape could not be too blatant in their attempts to prevent Harry from being baited without accidentally blowing Snape's cover as a double agent, and they couldn't tell Harry the exact reason for learning occlumency because Voldemort might be able to learn through the shared connection with Harry. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all became especially apparent to me when Dumbledore is about to flee from Hogwarts (presumably to hunt horcruxes?) after stunning Fudge and friends, he tells Harry the most important thing he needs to focus on is learning occlumency and that Harry will \*learn \*why \*soon \*enough (I don't have exact quote in front of me). I interpret this to mean Dumbledore is fully aware of Voldemort's plot to lure Harry and is not just guessing that Voldemort might do so. At this point, it's only a matter of time before the scheme is put into motion.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, it seemed almost too convenient that Voldemort and company accurately guessed that Harry might appear in the fire to confirm whether Sirius was at Grimmauld place. I realized it was because Harry had already done so when appearing a few weeks earlier to talk to Sirius and Lupin about Snape's memory of James tormenting him. When Harry showed up the first time, Lupin mentioned Sirius was trying to get Kreacher out of the attic, which at the time I thought was more to do with them not being able to find Kreacher because he was out plotting with the Malfoy's, but if we assume Kreacher actually was in the attic then he would have overheard Lupin telling Sirius that Harry was in the fire and wanted to talk, in which case Kreacher would have gone and told the Malfoy's. So basically, this was the final piece of the puzzle for the scheme to lure Harry to the ministry: show Harry that Sirius was captured and taken to where the prophecy is, and if Harry tries to check on him, he will likely use floo powder, so keep Sirius as far away from the fireplace in Grimmauld Place as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the fight in the ministry, Dumbledore does tell Harry that he only recently learned Kreacher had been communicating with the Malfoy's, but if my suspicions are correct that he knew the plot all along, he was still having to preserve Snape's cover and couldn't tell Harry how much he knew, not to mention it would have made Dumbledore sound like a total dick to be like ""oh yeah, sorry, I knew this was going to happen but didn't do more to stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear everyone else's take on this, and by all means feel free to point out whether I'm late to the game on this realization. I mostly just want to share my excitement over still discovering things in these books after so many re-reads.

2549,y2hbk,1558622279,"Hello all. 

I gifted my wife a geek gear subscription for the Harry Potter box but we have had nothing but issues with them. Boxes show up damaged, items out of the packaging or missing and I feel like the experience and quality of the boxes keeps going down hill. No more colored boxes or tissue paper and the items appear to be fewer and of lesser quality. We’re looking for something that is of high quality, can dispatch monthly and provides a great, personalized experience. I’ve looked at Loot Crate but it looks like they only come bi-monthly?

*Geek Gear rant for anyone interested*

Most recently we had a problem where we requested in the notes of an order that the “You’re Accepted” box be addressed to my wife and not to me. The order arrived with my name on the letters and envelope and the last name was mis-spelled. Reaching out to support they stated their system did not reflect the change in first name but they acknowledged the mis-spelling of the last name and would dispatch the replacement. No idea what happened as I clearly remember putting these details in the notes but I was happy with their offer. 

Fast forward a few weeks and the replacement arrived but they still didn’t change the first name. Support finally told us to go fly a kite and that they were never obligated to change the first name on the newly dispatched order. I informed them that if they weren’t going to fix the issue as a whole then they should have saved their money and not sent a replacement as the letter and envelope are still just as useless to us. The wording of their email also made it seem as though they were going to resolve both problems. 

Seems like a really odd move in practice. If you have to reprint and replace the order regardless and acknowledge the issues - why not fix both problems for maximum customer satisfaction if it costs you nothing more?

Would Voldemort allow a natural retirement for his faithful death eaters to sit and make the most of their sunshine years on the beach front? I can only assume it wouldn’t be the most efficient to have 80 year old death eaters. 

My only other thought is that he might gracefully kill them when their natural useful death eater life ends.

My one problem though was how did someone who is painted as such a good character in THIS movie end up siding with freaking VOLDEMORT! I mean with Grindelwald taking Credence from her I would think another dark lord with a similar goal would have her only too ready to tear Voldy another set of nostrils... And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. One thing credence and Voldemort have in common is they are both orphans that never got to know their parents. However credence’s story ends, perhaps Nagini will feel as though she has failed him. Maybe he dies? Maybe Credence gets locked up forever? Whatever the case credences story won’t end happily ever after and Nagini is going to blame herself. Here comes Tom Riddle, her second chance. Here comes the only person left in the world who can commune with her, and so it’s only natural she will feel some sort of responsibility to see that his dreams become a reality. What I originally wrote off as a lazy retcon might actually be some of the deepest lore bits in the HP universe. I just hope that I’m right and that this isn’t just a big oversight.

We only see one chapter of them yet it has spawned reams of fan fiction and countless web pages of fan art.

I think they are a fun addition, but honestly I don’t like them that much.  For starter, I admit they were flawed but ultimately “good” kids ( except Wormtail).

That being said I don’t think they have anything in common with the golden trio ( apart from sneaking around.) They aren’t and weren’t kind like the golden trio and have a haughtiness and self regard that Fred and George ( fellow mischief makers) lacked.

Honestly if the trio and Marauders went to school I’m not sure they’d be friends together ( including Harry and James).

Funnily enough of all the Marauders I like James the least.  He honestly strikes me as a kid who has had pretty much born good at everything and never really had to struggle to get what he wanted ever.

I liked Sirius a lot more. Sure he’s got a Vis IOU’s streak but it sort of makes sense coming from the family he comes from. Like he is one of the good guys but still had something of his family’s violent streak ( luring Snape to the werewolf, trying to kill Peter)

Remus is fine, but a bit flaky. I’m sorry he’s a werewolf, but I sort of thought he used that as a crutch/ excuse to leave Tonks and his child to be. I don’t see how you can be friends with two notorious trouble makers and not be implicated himself. He probably got into trouble with James and Siri both, just not as much.

Wormtail is well, Wormtail 🐀.

This isn’t to say I like Snape. I thought he was kind of wierd and unpleasant, and the whole obsession/ generation of Lily was kind of unhealthy. Even if he was bullied by James it’s not like he was filled with joy and good will, out to make the world a better place. Idk I liked him more before the whole “he loved Lily all along thing “ was revealed.

2641,Twinkling_Ding_Dong,1558528377,"First and foremost the most obvious similarity to each other they are both orphans, figuratively and literally. The both of them have lived with that absence in their lives, one hoping for their parents recovery and the other likely holding out hope albeit unconscious hope, until Hagrid shows up and destroys that hope, that his parents aren't really dead and will eventually come to take him away from the Dursleys. I could easily see the pair of them visiting St Mungos together to see the Longbottoms and Neville getting a chance to share with someone who could understand his thoughts and feelings on the matter of hoping for his parents return.

The both of them are also victims of abuse, both have suffered from copious amounts of neglect and denigration. With their friendship they can learn that

1. They aren't alone
2. It isn't their fault
3. they can trust someone, that they can rely on someone
4. They can stand up for themselves together
5. With the proper encouragement they can work harder and apply themselves, to make their parents proud of them
6. They can be better and get better, grow past their insecurities, Neville's stuttering

Through their friendship they could help each other move past their abuse and grow in a way that Ron and the Weasleys could never have helped. They would also help give each other a sense of self worth, the two of them have been constantly insulted, denigrated and compared to others, their self worth trodden upon time and again, never having the chance to bloom. I feel that this would be more important to Harry than Neville despite the fact that Neville is likely the one who receives the most verbal put downs; having seen how readily Harry throws himself into danger without the slightest hesitation or preparation, I worry that Harry is suicidal in a passive sense, having so little self worth that he is of a mind that if he dies while saving someone then it would be worth it, because then he would have contributed positively to anothers life and proven his worth, sort of like a suicde by police but with monsters instead.

Harry's self worth, pasive suicide, suicide by police, feeling that his death would be more preferable than another persons as it would bring worth to his life. come to the conclusion that in a life and death situation that his life is worth less from years of denigration

Harry could teach Neville to over come his fear of flying, an activity for them to do together and even bond over, maybe even join to Quidditch team in later years. (Same can be said for Hermione.)

Another bonding point or area of common experience is gardening, whilst I have no doubt that Harry isn't fond of gardening I think that is largely because he is forced to do so by the Dursleys; their is a fair chance that he feels great pride in his gardening skills, being able to make something grow that others appreciate, even if he doesn't get the credit for it, he knows that he is responsible for it and the compliments that are given to Petunia are in praise of him and his work, a little act of rebellion. Neville could help grow this by introducing Harry to the various magical plants and teaching him in turn about them, a character building moment for Neville as it allows him to be the teacher, to take pride in his knowledge and skill(grow his sense of self worth).

Building off the idea of enjoying tasks that the Dursleys force him to do is cooking, no doubt he hates cooking for the Dursleys, unappreciative arses that they are it is unlikely that gave him compliments and probably don't allow him to have dessert even if he made it. But in having a supportive friend like Neville he might begin to enjoy cooking. This would help Harry make new, positive, memories that he never had the chance to do before, another chance to take pride in his work and feel appreciated and grow his sense of self worth. This could also be turned towards practicing brewing potions together away from 'That Arsehole'. I can accept that the theory of intent can be applied to potions, expect the potion to fail or go wrong and it will go wrong, much like flying a broom expect the broom to go out of control or crash and it will; but Snape in no way is helping let alone teaching his students.

Neville would also be an excellent way to learn about the Potters, he could ask his gran about them, because they were hardly a minor family or even nobodies. The House of Black after all has standards and wouldn't have allowed one of their own to marry down and keep them in the family, the fact that Dorea wasn't disowned for marrying Charlus indicates that the Potters were either highly wealthy, influential or powerful in some other manner and thus worthy of being connected to the House of Black. Excellent world building opportunity.

Neville would get a new wand sooner, I could easily see a scene of the two of them together practicing charms or something(probably with Hermione) and picking up on the problem. ""I just don't get it, you're clearly a wizard otherwise you wouldn't be a student here, you've got the wand movements down exactly and you've gotten past your stuttering so pronunciation isn't the issue either. Maybe it's the wand, but that doesn't make sense why would Ollivander sell you the wand if it doesn't suit you?"" And the conversation goes from there about how he's using his father wand, at his grandmothers insistence(another mark against the woman in Harry's mental black book), then trying out Harry's wand(and Hermione's if she is there) and finding that it works marginally better for him, but not perfectly. ""*Holly... works most happily for those who may need help overcoming a tendency to anger and impetuosity.* ""

It would also present a chance for McGonagall to act like a frickin' head of house for once and actually help one of her students. And on that note anyone think that Hogwarts is a step away from becoming 'The Island' from Lord of the Flies? No adult supervision outside of class what so ever.

The two of them would absolutely appreciate their friendship more than Ron ever did and would stand together through thick and thin; both knowing what it's like to be lonely, to have the world turn against them and after all the support that they would have given each other, they might feel a little codependent towards each others and protect and guard each other jealously. So long as they have each other they can ignore the rest of the world brushing off the trouble they get during fourth and fifth year.

With Neville being a pureblood, born to an Ancient and Noble house(probably), he would be able to tell Harry more about the 'Wizarding World/Britain'(am I the only one who would prefer something like 'The Magical Isles' instead), telling him about St Mungos, the different shopping districts around Diagon Alley, the Knight Bus so they could meet up over the holidays; seeing the sights both muggle and magical, and House Elves which would likely lead to 'The Great Harry Potter Sir' taking Dobby on as his personal elf ensuring he is no longer trapped at Privet Drive and will be properly fed, gaining his aid in future adventures.

The friendship would be better for Hermione, does Neville really seem like the sort who would have constant arguments with her, insult or put her down on a regular basis? No, he doesn't. And like with Harry could explain a great deal of things to her about his culture, maybe even have debates as they get older.

Without Ron, who is rather belligerent and ill-mannered and you might even say possessive, there is a fair chance that Harry would go on to make more friends over the years and not just in Gryffindor but outside, maybe even some Slytherins.

I would like to think that their friendship would be reminiscent of Sam Wise and Frodo Baggins, both being super supportive of each other in their endeavours and being each others Sam Wise; giving each other pep talks before they go to ask a girl out. ""You the shit Neville, you got this."" And it would be absolutely amazing if during the Horcrux Hunt(if it would even go the same way which is unlikely, being more sensible, prepared and capable and all) they had their own [""The Tales That Really Mattered"" moment (from LOTRTT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6C8SX0mWP0).  But I also like the idea of them having moments of silliness like J.D. and Turk from Scrubs where they just do something ridiculous  together, none of that pranking crap just something really inane like giant doctor/wizard or tennis ball golf, but in later years when they're more confident. But then the idea of them being like Joliet and Elwood Blues comes to mind, of them just being badass and not giving a shit as they accomplish the impossible with complete confidence in each other, not for even a moment wavering in their convictions, that would make an interesting AU Deathly Hallows.

By the end of the series we all saw just how badass Neville was, imagine how much better he would have been with someone to support him and believe in him.

Why there's such a demand for a TV series in this sub or probably the whole fandom ?! Is it because of jealousy that Lord Of The Rings is being rebooted in Amazon as a TV series and His Dark Materials is receiving a TV Show in HBO ?! Is it because of jealousy that Game Of Thrones was able to have all the info in the books thanks to being a series instead of movies ?! Is it because the fans want to see the info that was omitted in the movies on the screen ?! Is it because the fans want to restart the series because they are unable to let go ?!

I may get downvoted to the center of the Earth for saying this, but, do you want to know my opinion ?! Well my opinion is this : "" I DON'T WANT A TV SHOW ""

That's right, I don't want a TV show, sorry not sorry, my reasons are this :

1. I'm too used to the old actors in the movies ( the least important reason )

2. I don't want the same story to be told for the third time, I've had enough, I was told the story for the first time in the form of the movies, then I read the books and heard the same story for the second time in a much more detailed way . I already know everything about the story of Harry James Potter, there's no need to tell me the same story that was in the books and movies in just a different medium . ( my most important reason )

3. Those who are pissed that the movies had to omit things, go read the books, they have every detail you want and nothing is omitted .

4. If a TV show that focuses on another era of the Wizarding World ever went into production, I would gladly watch it . A TV show about the First Wizarding War ?! Hell yeah !! I will gladly watch it !! A TV show about the Hogwarts founders ?! Of course !! Hell, create a TV show about a certain wizard kid ( make the kid a boy or a girl, I don't care ) who lives in another part of the world ( in America, Australia, Asia, France, idk, everywhere ) and is special in his/her own way and has nothing to do with Harry, Voldemort, Death Eaters, etc, I will gladly watch it .

2698,James_CyberLink,1558459738,"With Portkey Games advertising Wizards Unite on YouTube, I was thinking idly one day about what kind of game would work most efficiently in the Harry Potter universe, and I came up with this. I'd appreciate feedback on what you guys all think of it, seeing as you more than likely know your stuff when it comes to this!

&amp;#x200B;

Your character is a Muggle who basically stumbled into the plot by accident, as a terrorist cell of dark wizards has emerged, and things are going wrong all over the place. You are either immune to Memory Charms, or manage to avoid being hit by one, and you end up finding a way to infiltrate the Ministry of Magic to get answers to everything, or find at least *somebody* accountable.

Noticing how skilled you are at infiltrating, Harry notes that your life has already been ruined even before you got into the Ministry, and he also takes note of your talent for infiltrating places. You are then asked to help stop the terrorists and find out what's going on, with the help of Ron having George Weasley and Hermione Granger help him in putting together specialized gadgets, making Wizarding Wheezes into what is, in essence, a covertly outsourced Q-Branch, that gives the player magically enchanted gadgets and artefacts to assist in-game.

Should you be captured or killed, the memories of people who know you well will be modified, and the Ministry will deny your very existence.

The story could have elements of the mysteries that the novels have going on in spades, thanks to its linear level-by-level setup, but the levels are still large, sprawling castles and secret bases, non-linear in nature, with the player given a list of objectives, a large level, and away you go.

Maybe you'll knock somebody out and break their wand to stop them being a threat, or maybe you'll steal all kinds of stuff from them that incriminates them, and ask Hermione to get Rita Skeeter to publish an article ruining their reputation forever, or maybe you'll just steal all their stuff and bankrupt them, I don't know.

Maybe you'll get past some hostiles by using a Deluminator to knock out some light sources, maybe you'll use a gadget or artefact that allows you to turn invisible and you'll cautiously weave through the guards before the effect wears off, or maybe you'll just chuck a Golden Snitch at them from where they can't see you and slip away undetected because the guards are too busy falling over themselves trying to catch the annoying thing to notice some schmuck sneaking about. Or maybe you'll just pull out an enchanted club and pick them off one by one, knocking them all out. Not killing them, of course. J.K doesn't like that sort of thing, so let's not put it in the game. It's not the point after all.

Your enemies, however, may not think the same way. You may think that having a melee weapon to bludgeon enemies into unconsciousness is empowering, but up against 5 guards with the Body-Bind Curse, or even the KILLING CURSE... Yeah, you're going to want to remain stealthy. This would provide a large amount of tension, with the payoff being the somewhat amusing, and deliciously awesome fact that you just won against a bunch of wizards, as a mere Muggle, with simple gadgets that a wizard friend gave you.

2704,acerthorn,1558455353,"Prizoner of Azkaban ends with Harry busting Sirius out of his cell, just moments before he was about to receive the Dementor's Kiss, and sending him with Buckbeak into hiding.

But why did Sirius need to go into hiding?

Now obviously, in-universe, it's because Fudge refused to entertain Harry's assertion that Sirius was actually innocent. But from a literary point of view, why did Fudge need to be so stubborn?

Let's think about this for a minute: Prior to the events of Prisoner of Azkaban, there's a story-based reason why Harry has to grow up without Sirius in his life. If Sirius were around, he would have intimidated the Dursleys into not abusing him. As SuperCarlinBrothers points out, the Dursleys' abuse were what enabled Harry to know right from wrong during his teenage years: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQI2rt_qO4k

But after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban, was there any reason for Sirius to continue to be an outlaw?

Let's examine this for a minute. Let's assume that, at Harry's behest, Fudge finally agreed to give Sirius a trial. Sirius may have had to return to Azkaban in the interim, but he would have been acquitted at the trial.

How would the story have progressed since then? From what I can tell, not a whole lot.

Because Fudge didn't believe Harry, he and Hermoine had to use the time turner to save Sirius. This introduces time turners into the franchise. However, it definitely seems like the franchise could have done without that silly introduction. It certainly makes you wonder why the wizarding world doesn't use those things more often, something that Rowling had to justify in post-series interviews. The time turners were never used again in the main series, so you could have very easily just not had the time turners at all and the series would have been just fine. Sure, that means that the plot of Harry Potter &amp; the Cursed Child wouldn't have been possible, but I highly doubt many fans of the series would have complained there. Seriously ... Cursed Child ... Dragon Ball Minus &amp; Super ... the 2013 Whose Line is it Anyway reboot ... when will these fuckers ever learn that just because a series was popular in its prime doesn't mean it should be continued past its sell by date!

At the beginning of Goblet of Fire, the Dursleys already heavily improved their treatment of Harry because of the *fear* that Sirius would come and curse them if they found out he was being abused. Sirius would have been in a much better position to threaten them directly if he were free to just walk up to their front door and stick his wand in their face. So that aspect of the story doesn't change that much if Sirius is a free man.

Now, you might argue that, if Sirius were free, he would have taken Harry into his own home and let him leave the Dursleys forever, forcing Harry to break the bond of blood. But I don't see it. Dumbledore could have simply explained the bond of blood to Harry and Sirius and talked them out of moving Harry out of there.

Moving on to the Triwizard Tournament. Sirius being an outlaw only really served to make Harry panic when he thought Sirius was going to get caught. That's honestly about it. A few moments of teenage angst drama and it's resolved almost as quickly as it's brought up. Sirius would have been able to coach Harry on how to get through each task a lot better. Leading up to the Second Task, Harry didn't know until the very last minute to use gillyweed for the second task, but remember that he forgot to inform Sirius about that in his letter to Sirius. He was so swept up in the conversation he overheard between Moody and Snape that he completely forgot to ask Sirius about how to breath underwater. So Sirius being a free man wouldn't have changed much.

Sirius being a free man also would have changed very little in Order of the Phoenix. In the climax of that book, Sirius dies by being sent through the Veil. That is not a superfluous plot point; that is a huge moment in the story. However, there is no reason why Sirius couldn't have been a free man leading up to that moment. The implication is that his stir craziness from being couped up in Grimmauld Place for a year is what lead him to absolutely insisting that he come along, but there is no reason why Rowling couldn't have written it so that his overhwelming sense of paternal duty to Harry couldn't have been what drove him to go to the Ministry.

So yeah ... Sirius being an outlaw after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban didn't seem to actually contribute to the story. The only thing it really seemed to do is pile on more tragedy and sadness for Harry. He grew up with abusive relatives, and as soon as he has the opportunity to live with a man who loves him, that man has to go back into hiding. Can't this kid catch a break?!

So tell me ... is there anything, beyond the climax of Prisoner of Azkaban, that Sirius' outlawry contributes to the story that couldn't have worked any other way without it feeling horribly contrived, like a deus ex machina?",harrypotter,Why did Sirius need to be an outlaw after Prisoner of Azkaban?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/brccp2/why_did_sirius_need_to_be_an_outlaw_after/,1558426553.0

I went to a 2 year Middle School, 7th and 8th grade. Possibly the worst ages for children. 

Right before we entered the school year, we were all assigned our teams. At the time I thought it was just random, but looking back it’s clear they separated us by our report cards.

The smartest being in Team 1, and the Dumbest in Team 4

I was very good in Math, decent in most other subjects, and dreadful in 1 or 2 others.

So they placed me in Team 2.

And thus I was placed with other students who very like minded.

We were all, overall, fairly smart kids and quite cunning. No one was the best of the best, but we all managed to figured out how to stay in the upper echelon, through whatever means necessary.

Team 1 of course were the super brainy kids. They of all the teams kept to themselves, didn’t cause trouble. And usually walked around in very small groups of friends.

Team 3 kids were always so brash, outgoing, head strong. The types that were always up for the challenge, even if they were clearly outmatched. Ready for the fight.

Team 4 kids were charming, always walked around in super large groups of friends, and for the most part all had such humbling and affectionate personalities. They always looked so happy and rarely seen not having a great time.

At the end of the year, a championship was held amongst the teams. Each challenge was different, testing our Intelligence, our physical strengths, and our Creativeness. From Trivia games, to Sporting competitions, to performing Skits on stage.

In both years, Team 3 won first place, with Team 2 coming in 2nd place. 

Even though we were all separated by our grades from elementary school, it’s amazing how that shows in personality types.

It’s not to say that there weren’t popular kids amongst all the teams, or that there weren’t bullies here and there.

But overall it’s plain to see how each Team so closely resembled the Houses in Hogwarts. 

Team 1 = Ravenclaw
Team 2 = Slytherin
Team 3 = Gryffindor
Team 4 = Hufflepuff

There may not have been any real magic going on at that school, but to me, the best part of wanting to go to Hogwarts, was about being sorted into your house, and competing throughout the year to earn the house cup!

2815,WellGreatThisSucks,1558372349,"This is both strange and concerning to me and I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and can offer ‘advice’.

I’m in my early thirties and have never read or followed the Harry Potter series. I’ve casually seen, I think, 2 of the movies over the years with family or just by happenstance that it’s on tv...whatever. However, I have always had an admiration for Rowling and her creativeness that garnered the story worth billions. 

I was browsing through the audio book app that I use yesterday for a new book to listen to while I drive. I typically listen to books in the self-development or business section but have occasionally listened to a sci-fi fiction book. Anyway, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was on the list of suggested titles for me, I think because I recently listened to Ready Player One. 

After some deliberation, I decided that it could be kind of cool to listen to this book mainly from the perspective of Rowling creating these ideas when she did (I am vaguely familiar with her story- poor, hopeless, came up w the idea for HP on a train ride, etc.). Again, the details and fact that 1 person (rather than a team) came up with this idea out of thin air that spawned 7 books, 8 movies, a theme park, worldwide obsession and billions of dollars is fascinating to me. 

**Now to the point**

The audio book is about 8 hours long and I am currently 3:30 to 4:00 hours into it, so almost halfway. 

I just now had to delete the audio book from my phone.

I listened to almost 3 hours of it yesterday on a car trip and afterwards had a dark cloud over me, just kind of a sense of depression where nothing seems to matter. I cannot make sense of it as I have never felt this way before. 

The only things I can think of are that I could be feeling depressed because that fantasy world does not exist but instead we have this boring one (though I can’t say that I actually feel that - I have consumed many fantasy worlds through movies, tv, and some books before and never felt that). **OR** That maybe I feel depressed that I could never create something like this (like Rowling did) and that I will do nothing *great* with my life.

It’s strange too that when I try to think about why I feel this way, I specifically consider these two things and neither necessarily gives me the feeling of *oh yes, that’s it* so it may be something else entirely. I’ve deleted the book and hope that this feeling will subside within a couple days.

I’m wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and not necessarily *only* with HP.",harrypotter,Had to quit reading half way through - happen to anyone else?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bqybzh/had_to_quit_reading_half_way_through_happen_to/,1558343549.0

2820,valethehowl,1558370378,"For some reason, with every single tweet on Pottermore and the new movies like Fantastic Beast, the depiction of the Wizarding World is getting more and more evil.   
First of all, the Statute of Secrecy is NOT in place to protect muggles or wizards: like Hagrid said, it's in place so that the wizards wouldn't be annoyed by muggles. Muggles are powerless against wizards, and wizards have NOTHING to gain from ruling them directly (magic gives them everything, from infinite food to immortality), but a direct rule would require some responsibilities, and wizards can't be bothered with that. What's worse is that wizards have easy solutions for most single major causes of muggles death. They can cure EVERY SINGLE muggle disease with ease (as stated by Rowling herself). And yet they do nothing. I'd fully expect wizards to organize tours in pediatric oncology wards and laugh at how muggle children with cancer looks funny without their hair. They can even multiply food and water (like Jesus) and let millions die of starvation.   
Second, despite the ""live and let live"" thing they profess with the muggles, they actively  dominate and brainwash the muggles without any sort of guilt. Charming and using love potions, cancelling memories and causing brain damage, it's all fair game if done on muggles, who have even LESS rights than animals. If a muggle child die in a magical accident (like, being killed by an Obscurial) they simply Obliviate the mother, who would not remember what happen to her child and would likely spend all the rest of her life trying to find it.   
Third, ALL wizards thinks of themself as superior to Muggles. Even muggle-lovers as Weasley are clearly paternalizing towards muggles, while muggle-borns like Hermione are quickly brainwashed into thinking that Muggles are inferior. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the Harry Potter is about the ""power of love""? Well only wizard love... muggles don't count.

2822,Linguinidotexe,1558369680,"Hey! I’m a Criminological Sciences student. I’m currently, while writing this post, in my second year of University. As you could see, I’m interested in learning about crime and all that comes with it. 
This whole part will all make sense later on. 

I am a big fan of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. I am currently listening to the audiobooks and got some inspiration from the first book. In the first book, fifth chapter (The Philosophers Stone, Diagon Alley) Hagrid and Harry go to Diagon Alley, where they firstly visit Gringotts. Gringotts is the bank for wizards. Hagrid tells Harry about the highly secured bank. He tells Harry that there are rumors a dragon guards the banks and their safes (later comfirmed there indeed is a dragon). Further, the bank is secured using spells, enchantments and the goblins themselves. 

To link both parts of this post. When riding the train on my way to University, listening to my audiobook, I thought to myself about a story involving a crime taking place in Gringotts. 

I have been imagining a story where a Dark Wizard, an old follower of You Know Who, masterminds a plan to break into Gringotts (possibly with other outlaws). It would show the dark side of the Wizarding World we all fell in love with. Further, the story would emphasize on the dark spells and other magical things. 

As for the timeline, I was thinking of making the story taking place years after Harry’s story due to the main character being an old follower of You Know Who.

First of all, Lets not debate whether one religion is better or worse, Thats not my point. lets just discuss the existence of them, and not the merits of religion/lack of it. 

JK has deliberately avoided any mention of God/s and religions and rightly so! I would hate for fans to be alienated based on it, so kudos to her. 

As there isnt much info, this took some detective work and tons of connecting the dots  


&amp;#x200B;

First of all, There's a Church in Godric Hallow and the potters/Peverell were buried in the church's graveyard so I'd say there were at the very least semi-frequent church goers/members. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, the fact that the afterlife is not only touched on but also a reality seems to indicate that some level of heaven/afterlife is present, this would rule out the entirely naturalistic/scientific worldview (if magic itself did not rule it out before lol).

&amp;#x200B;

Third, Christmas is celebrated. Maybe this is more of a cultural thing but apparently its one of the few ""cultural"" holidays. Other ""Cultural holidays"" seem to be Valentines (which is a catholic saint's death anniversary), New year, Halloween and Easter ( In *DH*, the chapter *Malfoy Manor* takes place during the Easter holidays; Narcissa Malfoy specifically says Draco is home from Hogwarts on his Easter holiday. )

Except for New year this are entirely Religious holidays. I know that all of them have turned into cultural holidays but if you see, the red/green color combination for christmas is not used. This combination was associated with Christmas first in the Victorian era England, ie 1800s. Even if this was a muggle thing, 200 years is enough for 2 colors to bleed to Hogwarts (I mean, Jeans and Hoodies did). This would indicate that they celebrate it not as a 100% cultual thing for muggle born and half bloods.

&amp;#x200B;

Also Why would the Malfoys celebrate Easter if they were not at least christian wizards? after all Christmas is super cultural, but Easter not so much (at least in my country) only Christians call it Easter holidays, non-christian call it ""Turism week"" instead of Holy Week. Sure, maybe the Malfoys dont, but Hogwarts seems to! 

And this could be maybe cultural, but for example there's no indication that festivities like  Burns Night  (Scotland, Jan 25) are celebrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, only Christian holidays seem to be observed/mentioned, so at the very least there are either Christian Wizards or Christian-seeming wizards, no Idea on other religions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would not say that in the HP world Chrisitanity is true per se and that there's a strictly christian heaven and hell but there appears that there is not only a ""heaven like place"" but also some form of Hell or torturous afterlife too (Ie for people who have split their souls like voldemort.)

&amp;#x200B;

This is inconclusive, But at least for me, there seems to be evidence for religious wizards. 

(We cant avoid the strongly christian imagery all across the series anyways)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you lived in a world were magic, ghosts, vampires, etc. exists... why would you disqualify a God from existing? sure, maybe doing wizardry would seem counter productive for a christian/muslim/jew as they all forbid it, but I mean, lying, cheating, Porn and pre-marital sex is also strongly banned yet people indulge in it freely, so I dont see it as such a big issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, lets not discuss the merits of religion, Just the existence or not of religious wizards.

This year's campaign is a Wizarding World of Harry Potter campaign that focuses on what the Wizarding World is like internationally outside of Hogwarts and Ilvermorny. We wish to increase the representation and diversity of characters in this universe by exploring life in Mahoutokoro (Japan), Castelobruxo (Brazil), Uagadou (Africa), Koldovstoretz (Russia), and more!

It will be divided into 2 Acts : (a) while characters are still students in school (b) while they are full grown adults in the Wizarding World. We hope it will be interesting to watch these characters grow and evolve from children to adults, when they may be more focused on their careers, families, etc.

The viewers auditioned to participate, and the top candidates were interviewed so viewers could ""vote"" on their favorites to be a part of the campaign. If you are interested in seeing a full overview of the campaign, as well as the entire audition process, the playlist is here.

As for the campaign itself, we just released Session 0, which provides ""origin"" stories of each character and their respective countries/wizarding school. We hope to continue releasing the following sessions every other week (with Vlogs during the off weeks).

2889,manchotendormi,1558306369,"Not gonna lie, it bothers me a teensy tiny bit when I hear people complain that ""witches and wizards never learn basic math? they'll never know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell??"" And, to be fair, it's a good point. There's not an algebra through differential calculus course at Hogwarts. But really... do they need it? Yes, as muggles we know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but has that information ever proved to be necessary in your day to day life?

Instead, I propose the following:

Astronomy teaches Physics and any required Mathematics.

Transfiguration teaches Animal Biology and Materials Science.

Potions teaches Chemistry.

Herbology teaches Plant Biology and Botany.

History of Magic is pretty self explanatory.

Flying Class is the minimum requirement of P.E.

And then there are other elective classes like Ancient Runes (foreign language), Arithmancy (advanced mathematics), and Muggle Studies (""cultural geography"").

I believe that in the Hogwarts classes, the muggle subjects are taught well enough that the theory of the science helps to complete the magical tasks (for example, knowing the differences between vertebrates and invertebrates and how it relates to transfiguration), even if they don't go into as much depth as a muggle class. The students aren't tested necessarily on the muggle science but they need to be able to use it as needed for their magical studies. 

I remember basic plant biology but couldn't tell you anything about the Krebs cycle. Because honestly, the only people who need to really know about it are researchers who specialize in that field.

2894,CoraxNoir,1558304952,"I've decided to have a go at writing an outline for a completely re-written and actually logical Harry Potter series. One thing I've found hard to overcome is the ludicrous concept of the Triwizard Tournament. So I need everyone's help to figure out what to do about it. I'll go over each problem in order, with notes and comments by myself and what I need help with underneath.

&amp;#x200B;

1. There are only three schools participating.

Okay, so this is easy enough to fix. I've picked out a few optimal spots to join besides Sweden and France. These include schools from India, the United States of America (Ilvermorny), Brazil, Egypt, China/Japan, and Russia. If you can think of anywhere else, do tell. I also need names for these schools. I imagine that exploring the cultures of different wizarding communities would be fascinating. I also imagine that some sort of translation spell would be needed for all students to communicate. Only the seniors would come, and they would take classes at Hogwarts with the British students.

2. They randomly decided to restart it despite students dying.

First of all, no students dying allowed. And secondly, I think this has actually been happening pretty regularly. Maybe once every seven years? So this year is no different - maybe a little more grand. What do you think?

3. Harry was forced to participate.

No, this isn't going to work. Not only is it very illegal and unprofessional, it's a stupidly risky plan for Voldy to make. Maybe Harry's allowed to participate, given that it's not life-threatening? In that case, he puts his name in like everyone else and wins. But that's not too exciting, is it? And then we don't get Cedric. This one I really need help with. How could we end up with Cedric despite Hogwart's non-cheating ways? How can Harry get in without the other schools going ballistic?

4. It's not conducive to learning.

We're not going to cancel exams, and we're not going to have the champions preparing for each task for months. Tasks should be numerous and quick, and should fall on dates that student's don't have class. They shouldn't require preparation. So scrap the nutty egg, as much fun as it is. Exams are most certainly not canceled. This one should be easy to bypass.

5. It's really dangerous.

This is no good. We cannot have live dragons thinking their children are being taken away, near-drowning experiences, and literal man-eating beasts in a maze of doom. And we also need some variety. What about those kids who suck at risking their life by throwing themselves into danger, but are incredibly intelligent or very well-spoken? We need a lot of little tasks, none of which involve death. The maze at the end can stay (not including the creatures that kill people), but the rest must be re-done. What sorts of tasks can you think of?

6. Nobody could see anything.

Well, if the tasks change, this won't matter much. And despite their muggle hatred, maybe they can just swallow their pride and use some video cameras? Some magical folk on brooms following them around? Anything will work, really.

7. It didn't help international relations at all.

Unless it was romantically. None of the teachers got along, and one completely lost its headmaster. And then these kids were just sent off on their own to explain this. Can we give them an escort, please? But more than that, I want to see international relations improving. I want to see kids learning about one another's cultures, making friends for life and keeping in touch. I want to see anyone except Headmasters and Champions becoming recurring characters. Can we have some foreign friends for the Trio? No, Viktor doesn't count.",harrypotter,Everything Wrong With the Triwizard Tournament - Help Me Fix It,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bqn164/everything_wrong_with_the_triwizard_tournament/,1558276152.0
2897,UrielyBrendon,1558303986,"Ok so this might be a little biased since I am in Hufflepuff but hear me out, people are always talking crap about Hufflepuffs, right? But you see, those people are literally as dumb as a brick. I am also guessing that they believe they are in Gryffindor because eVeRyOne WhO dOeSn'T wAnT tO bE iN tHe EvIl HoUsE, nErDs hOuSe Or WoRsE oF aLl,ThE lItTlE cRyBaBy'S hOuSe GeT tO bE iN tHe BiG,sTrOnG lIon'S hOuSe right?

 Well to all those who believe that they're in Gryffindor and never read the books or watch the movies, why the hell are you on this sub? If you're just here just because you're bored then fair enough but ffs P L E A S E T A K E T H E P O T T E R M O R E Q U I Z JUST SO YOU WON'T AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME YOU'RE IN GRYFFINDOR BECAUSE I SWEAR PEOPLE ARE BANDWAGONS. 

But anyways onto the point, Helga Hufflepuff had said around these line,""I'll take the lot."" Which means she took in all the others. But guess what Hufflepuffs could have the traits of the other houses but they don't actually value that trait.

 Don't believe me? Well Loyalty could go with bravery and guess what house value bravery the most? GRYFFINDOR. LET'S NOT ALSO FORGET THAT HUFFLEPUFF WAS THE SECOND HOUSE THAT STAYED AT HOGWARTS TO FIGHT IN THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS. And why? Hufflepuffs are loyal to their second home and they are willing to do whatever it takes to help protect Hogwarts BECAUSE THEY VALUE LOYALTY. 

AND BY HAVING LOYALTY AND DECIDING TO FIGHT, THEY ARE SHOWING BRAVERY. Loyalty could also be seen as being ambitious and being determined but being determined could run through every house so that one doesn't count. But being ambitious is being eager which hufflepuff and Gryffindor (not sure if any ravenclaws fought) students were while fighting in the battle of Hogwarts. 

(Before any comes at me, I just want to say that I am not saying that every house is like Hufflepuff or any other house! I just wanted to say my opinion that's all!)

2909,andreygrimes,1558291793,"*One of the few interesting mega elements in Fantastic Animals - The Grindelwald Crimes is the mysterious Blood Pact that the mega villain carries with them. Pact in which the two swore - never - to fight against each other.                                              Except that from the perspective of the Perpetual Vow, it is more than possible that either one of you breaks the Pact of Blood something happens to you both. After all, starting from the idea that Dumbledore and Grindelwald will face each other, then the Pact will be broken. The X-point of all this is HOW this Covenant will be broken.*

**So will the Blood Pact be broken in Fantastic Beasts 3 ?!**

**Yeah. I had this idea starting from the following idea: Among the various bridges that Fantastic Beasts 2 made with Fantastic Beasts 3, two of them highly important, are: Credence is actually Aurelio Dumbledore, brother of Dumbledore, and O Blood Pact needs to be undone.**

**Thus, I am coming to the conclusion that the focus of Fantastic Beasts 3 will be precisely the complete journey to undo this pact. And even more, it is likely that the way it can be broken will be found in the country that will be used as the setting for Fantastic Beasts 3.**

*So, starting from the idea that The Crimes of Grindelwald was a hunt for the various Ministries of Magic of the world by Grindelwald, he may now become the hunter. After all, if the pact is broken - I assume that there may be consequences for the two who did it, just like the Perpetual Vow - Grindelwald is at a disadvantage because several can kill the villain (including the quartet: Newt, Theseus , Queenie and Tina, even Queenie having passed the Black Side of the Force), but only Credence will be strong enough to kill Dumbledore.*

*That is, it will not be easy to break the Pact of Blood, but when it comes to being broken, the consequences will not be so advantageous for Grindelwald.

On rereading the *Chamber of Secrets* recently, I realised once again just how skillful Rowling with subtle clues. Of course, I knew that Ginny was responsible for opening the Chamber and so on, but I still marvelled at how unobtrusive the clues were, such as Ginny's incredible upset over Mrs. Norris, and her sudden appearances.

3016,Philly927,1558130425,"I'm relistening to the audio books and I have some questions. Maybe someone could shine some light on them? I just started Book 7 for reference:

1) Book 7 when they leave to transport Harry in the beginning. He is underage and performing magic. Why isn't the ministry (then Death Eaters) tipped off to his exact location? They seem to be oddly specific on finding someone when they break rules

2) Why would Polyjuice potion give the person scars? I'd assume it'd be off DNA so things like scars, lost limbs, dyed hair color, etc, how do those get changed? Also, you can transfigure into an animal (kind of) but not a giant? 

3) Harry performed magic in the cave with Dumbledore. Why didn't the Ministry get him then for being underage?

4) Why wouldn't wizards just attach tracking devices or bombs to owls to find people? They can find anything. Same with Thestrals. Hop on one and let it know you need to find Voldemort.

5) When Draco knocks Harry out on the train, why wouldn't he just steal the cloak rather than cover Harry up with it? An invisibility cloak is invaluable but covering Harry up with it is an inconvenience at most to Harry.

6) Why wouldn't they make something similar to badge reels for wands? As often as people seem to drop wands, it seems like a no brainer.

7) Not really an oversight more of ""WTF"". Arthur gets tickets to the Quidditch World Cup, Ron gets to invite 2 friends and no one else gets to bring a friend. That's not fair!

8) Again, just an observation but Harry needed a signed slip to visit Hogsmead but could join the Quidditch team, Take part in the Triwizard event and fight all these beasts in DAtDA no problem?

9) I find it really out of character that Hermione ripped a page out of a really old book and wrote the word ""PIPES"" on it. That's not a Hermione thing to do.

10) What do Wizards do if they want to make a copy of a picture? It moves, can they just do a duplicate spell?

11) Who funds Hogwarts? Wizard taxes must be insane.

&gt;  
&gt;‘I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,’ he invented. ‘I – I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.’  
&gt;  
&gt;Quirrell cursed again.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘Get out of the way,’ he said. As Harry moved aside he felt the Philosopher’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?  
&gt;  
&gt;But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips  
&gt;  
&gt;‘He lies … He lies …’  
&gt;  
&gt;‘Potter, come back here!’ Quirrell shouted. ‘**Tell me the truth**! What did you just see?’

&gt;  
&gt;‘Let me speak to him … face to face …'

&gt;‘I have strength enough … for this …’

&gt;  
&gt;He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.

While I wouldn't be too happy about it, I'm perfectly willing to accept that maybe the wizarding school system, like lots of real ones, is absolute garbage for prepping you for the real world and is mostly busywork. I can also believe that the wizarding world follows a ""standard education --&gt; technical training"" model rather than emphasizing  university like modern Muggle life does. Plus, the wizarding world is definitely suffering from some kind of [technological freeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/38192x/why_do_many_fantasy_worlds_have_stagnant/) like most fantasy worlds do (wizards are too far up their own asses to accept ballpoint pens over quills, for example), so they don't need to update their education or career system.

So, what's the career track for a witch or wizard? Ministry jobs offer training and probably half the population works for the MoM, but what about other careers? What if they want to go into teaching--do they just travel for a decade then come back and interview at Hogwarts? If you want to be a baker, did none of your schooling matter?

3064,valethehowl,1558081543,"I have a question... it's been shown that magic doesn't really advance that fast. Wizards are pretty much stuck with the same level of power they had in the Middle Ages, save from very few things. From what I've seen, Magic progression is linear: there isn't much to do to make it advance faster.   


Meanwhile Muggle science advancement is quadratic. They may have started with a HIDEOUS handicap, but they are catching up very fast, and faster still with every generation. In only 100 years muggles have literally gone from moving on horses and carriages to flying on airplanes. One can only wonder what they'll able to do in another 100 years at the current pace.   


So... what would happen then, when (not if, \*when\* ) Muggle tech will eventually reach and outgrow magic? When Muggles could cure any disease and even become immortal with ease, travel through space faster than light, create advanced artificial intelligence and even resurrect the dead, would the wizards still deny the superiority of  science? Or would they come out, since at this point they have all to gain and nothing to lose?",harrypotter,"What would happen in the future, when Muggle science becomes better than magic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bpolyk/what_would_happen_in_the_future_when_muggle/,1558052743.0

3066,Melusinahp,1558079437,"Snape wanted to die after Lily was murdered. His pain and remorse were so extensive that he couldn’t bear to live. In order to repair a soul damaged from misdeeds, especially murder, one must experience remorse so intense it’s unbearable. And Snape experienced that. He regretted abetting Voldemort so deeply the damage he’d done to his soul was repaired. Because Dumbledore gave him that chance and a reason to live–protecting Lily’s son. 

So, when Snape asked Dumbledore “What of my soul?” he was a man who knew the consequences of murder, of the damage it does to a person. And he knew what it took to repair that damage. He was speaking from lived experience. But Dumbledore knew that killing someone who wanted and needed to die wasn’t the same as committing murder. Dumbledore needed Snape to kill him so Draco didn’t have to. So Draco’s soul would remain undamaged. 

Additionally:

Whenever the “Is Dumbledore evil?” argument comes up, I see people blaming him for not stopping Draco earlier when he knew Draco was trying to kill him. And having just finished HBP again, this frustrates me a lot. Because Dumbledore did everything he could. He tasked Snape with shadowing Draco, with trying to keep him from hurting anyone. He didn’t just let Draco fail around coming close to killing bystanders.“A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as himself. Offer him help and guidance…” “I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy.”  Snape tried and didn’t always succeed. 

Dumbledore could not have stopped Draco himself. He could not let Draco know that he was aware of the plot to kill him. Because while Draco was good at Occlumency, he was still a kid and no match for Voldemort. As we know, Draco’s entire assignment was a ruse, a method of punishing Lucius. If Voldemort had believed that Draco had given himself away he’d have killed him in a heartbeat. And Dumbledore knew that. “I appreciate the difficulty of your position. Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you. I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you.”

Dumbledore was already dying, from the Ring curse and from the poison from the cave, but he engineered the method of his death with the specific intention of saving the soul of a teenage boy who’d been trying to murder him. (And for the Elder Wand stuff, of course.) If you think he’s evil, you’re wrong.

(It also continues to fascinates me that Dumbledore flat out told Draco that Snape was his man and not Voldemort’s. But of course, even if Draco had begun to believe him any doubts would have been quashed when Snape used the AK.)",harrypotter,HBP/DH Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bpod3v/hbpdh_thoughts/,1558050637.0

Ok, great, but in order for Harry's life to be threatened, there needs to be Dementors showing up at his doorstep.

So how exactly does Harry get off here? The only way would be if the Ministry concedes that there are Dementors outside of their control. And as far as I can recall, they never conceded such a point.

You only live once, and I want to enjoy this piece of magic while it’s here. I’ve heard much about the iconic Harry Potter series, whether it be from friends, family, or people on the internet. However, my knowledge is very limited overall.

I know of the four houses, and the general stereotypes of them:
* **Gryffindor**: Overrated house; wild partiers
* **Slytherin**: Evil house; goth hotties
* **Hufflepuff**: Leftover house; kind stoners
* **Ravenclaw**: Forgotten house; weird nerds

I know of the three main characters, and their stereotypes as well:
* **Harry Potter**: Plot vessel; confused hero
* **Hermione Granger**: Self-insert; bitchy nerd
* **Ron Weasley**: Comic relief; useless moron

In all seriousness, I’m excited to actually finally flesh out this world I’ve heard so much about. The premise seems decent, and there’s obviously a large fan base for a reason. I plan on starting by reading all 7 books, because that’s the main branch. I’ll have a post dedicated to my thoughts after I finish each book. Seeing as how I don’t want to binge-read and ruin the experience, I’m expecting to complete the series in about three weeks. After I read all 7 books, I’ll sort myself into a house. I don’t want to do it without context, I suppose.

3083,Raspberry_Mango,1558042132,"Summer always invokes an urge to read the series. I've been checking this thread a lot lately, so I guess that means it's time to start again!

&amp;#x200B;

It was summer break when I first read Philosopher's Stone. The first film was out but I hadn't seen it, so I must have been 12 when I read PS for the first time (I'm thinking 2002). We lived 25 km outside of town, so during the summer we sometimes only went into town for groceries &amp; errands once a week. So, once I had devoured PS in like one day, I had nothing left to do but read and re-read all my favourite parts (Diagon Alley) for a week until I could get to the library for CoS &amp; PoA. The scent of grass &amp; leaves &amp; warm air always stir those good memories. After that, I was thoroughly obsessed.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 4 books were out at the time I got obsessed, and I read them over and over while I waited what seemed AGES for the release of OotP (actually it was probably only like a year). FINALLY it was released and I had pre-ordered it online since we didn't have a bookstore in my town. As it turns out, the one major grocery store ended up bringing in a skid of OotP so everyone else got their copies before me even though I had pre-ordered it :( man I was SO anxious for it to arrive in the mail. I kept asking my parents when they got home from work if it had arrived, and days went by without any delivery. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day I got a feeling that it must be arriving soon (this was before package tracking and we lived pretty far from a city). I made a plan to bring my rollerblades and a mini-backpack to school (this was the early 2000s after all), borrow our mailbox key, and skate to the post office on my lunch break. It had finally arrived!!! I was so excited to finally have it I nearly wiped out skating back down the ramp of the post office. Haha. I stopped at our local Subway to quickly eat a sandwich for lunch and started reading there.   


Since this was very close to the end of the school year, we were just watching some movie in class that afternoon, so I asked my teacher for permission to read instead and sat near the window where I could use the light to read by. 

&amp;#x200B;

When HBP was released, I was away at camp for two weeks. I had either pre-ordered it or my mom picked it up while I was away. I made her promise to bring it with her when she picked me up from camp. She watched my final camp performance, packed my stuff up in the car, I said ""Hi Mum, love you. Gonna read now"" and probably didn't speak to her for 3 hours ;D

&amp;#x200B;

So I was part of the magic for the release of 3 books and 7 of the 8 films. I think my mom may have feared for my mental stability at one point, since I couldn't talk about anything else! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm not really a fan of anything released post-Deathly Hallows. I like to keep the magic of the series just as it was when the books were still coming out. My memories of that time are just so pure and happy :) I wonder if that will ever happen again for me with the Potterverse? Maybe with a Marauders TV show or something, that would be cool.

3087,poeticwasteland,1558039725,"So yesterday I saw a discussion about Gryffindor &amp; Slytherin friendships, or rather, the lack of them in the Potterverse. It got me thinking &amp; gave me an idea for a new fanfic centred around the development of a friendship between Blaise Zabini &amp; Cormac McLaggen. I tossed together a draft for what would become the first chapter, but to be honest, I haven’t written fanfiction in literally 10 years, and I’m not sure if this new one works. I’d appreciate a bit of feedback re: tone &amp; style and whether or not you think it’s worth continuing. It begins during the period in HBP when McLaggen is filling in for Ron on the Gryffindor Quidditch team (but before the disastrous match when he ends up hitting Harry over the head with the bat) Without further ado, I present a draft of my new titleless fic...


Zabini stretched lazily, and leaning back, he tilted his chair, balancing delicately on its two rear legs. He fought the urge to roll his eyes, to sigh. The Slug Club. The name, he thought, was about as terrible as pretty much every other person in it was. But in spite of how often his fellow members made him want to scream, pull out his own hair, or punch them, he attended meetings religiously. Because he did respect the group’s leader, Professor Slughorn. He held a degree of respect for this particular teacher that bordered on admiration, a new and peculiar feeling for Blaise, one he still had some difficulty admitted to himself. But still, the fact remained that he admired the way Slughorn controlled such a vast number of strings, and all from the secure comfort of the backseat. Slughorn, Zabini thought, was a superb puppet master. And Blaise wanted to learn that trade; how better than to do so at the knee of a true great? So he made a point of attending each and every Slug Club function. He’d even arrived early for tonight’s, but if he was being honest with himself that fact had much more to do with his being unable to stomach another moment of Pansy’s xenophobia and/or Draco’s braggadocio; he was growing insanely weary with the thinly veiled implication Malfoy was now an official Death Eater. Because even if Malfoy wasn’t lying about joining Voldemort, Blaise didn’t subscribe to the Death Eater cause, and frankly, it seemed like the sort of lifestyle where one will end up either dead or in Azkaban very quickly. And he had grown accustomed to the lavish sort of life his mother’s inherited money was able to provide. Yeah, Blaise thought, Slughorn has the right of it. And Blaise just wished, for the first and only time in his life, that he was this particular teachers pet. Fat chance. He thought with a derisive snort. Like there was any way he could unseat Precious Potter, the Chosen Boy Who Lived, from Slughorn’s right hand side. And even if he managed to pull off that miracle, Hermione Granger was no slouch; she would become serious competition to fill the chair vacated by Potter. She was one to watch. Which amused him slightly, as she was such a single minded, single skilled person. She was all books, all logic and brains. The girl didn’t even play Quidditch. Blaise knew he wasn’t as outrightly intelligent as Hermione, but he also knew he had other skills and assets going for him. Like the fact that he was a damn effing good Chaser, and perhaps more importantly, the fact that he was really superior at reading people and situations. This intuitive nature, he‘d inherited from his mother, who’d helped him hone it to a fine point as a child. 
“If you know what people want before they can ask you for it, Blaise honey, you’ll be better suited to negotiate a position that lets them think they’re winning, while really you’re getting better deal.” She would tell him with a sly smile. And he’d learnt to do just that. He began to chuckle internally at the fond memory, but his nostalgia was interrupted when Slughorn’s classroom door swung open. Zabini leaned forward to sit straight, righting his chair in the process, as he expected Slughorn’s prodigious stomach to follow the swinging door into the room. He was surprised, however, to see not his teacher, but Cormac McLaggen, decked out in Gryffindor Quidditch robes, flecks of mud caked on his boots. Blaise inclined his head towards him in a non-verbal gesture of greeting. Of all the members of the Slug Club, McLaggen was just about the only one he could tolerate. 
“What’s good?” 
McLaggen hooked his ankle around another chair and drag-kicked it out towards himself. With a dramatic display of exhaustion, he threw himself down into it before responding. 
“Not the effing Gryffindor Quidditch team. Which has the worlds most incompetent, idiotic captain in the history of ever. Practice was lousy. Because Potter plays favourites and doesn’t know how to take some well intentioned constructive criticism. He’s a halfway decent seeker, but he doesn’t know jack about playing other positions. How can you be the captain when you can’t play every role?! And what kind of captain schedules practice for the time window just before he has some super important meeting with a teacher?! We really needed to keep practicing, but we couldn’t because Potter had to leave to make his meeting on time.” McLaggen let out an exasperated sigh. “Sorry. Ugh. He just really irks me. But on the plus side, practice being over means I was able to make it here, in time for one of Old Sluggy’s shindigs. And also Potter being in his other meeting means he won’t be in this one to irk me more, you know?” 
Blaise nodded. “He blows off more Slug Club parties than he attends. Honestly, I get the feeling he doesn’t like being a part of the Slug Club. Lord only knows why. And if he doesn’t want to be here, he shouldn’t come ever. Slughorn’s time is valuable; it’s incredibly rude of Potter to have his teacher waste time and efforts on talking to him when he doesn’t even want to be here to listen. Some of the rest of us really do. Some of us would give our left nut for the time to get the sort of attention and advice Potter gets from Slughorn.” 
“Dude. You’re totally right.”
“Someone needs to take Potter down a couple of pegs. His celebrity has gotten out of hand.” 
“Again, dude, you’re right, but how could we...or, I mean, who even could do that?”
“I think...yes, I think we can manage, just you and I. I think what Potter needs is to be on the receiving end of a hardcore lesson teaching prank.” Zabini smiled slightly as McLaggen’s face broke out into a grin. 
“That could be just the ticket. The very thing. And I’m getting the impression you might have an idea or two for that very prank cooking behind those eyes.” 
“Cormac, I just might. And I also think this might be the beginning of a really beautiful friendship.”

Today I started to re-read the very first book while  taking notes on almost anything that took my interest and I nocited how in the second page when Vernon tries to kiss his son before going to work, he fails because Dudley just had an anger attack and threw his cornflakes against the wall.

This day should be the day after the Potters were killed, so november 1, 1981. Harry should be 15 months old by now. 

When Vernon gets home from work it is mentioned that the Potter's kid and their loveley Dursley should be about the same age (Dudley is five weeks older).

So my question is; is 1.5 years old a normal age to be eating cornflakes? To me it seems like a choking hazard. I am asking because I assume every small mistake has already been discussed elaborately in this subreddit, so it's probably just me who is wrong.

In almost every discussion about house traits, everyone always just seems to expect Ravenclaws to be the ones that get housepoints for beeing smart in class and having all the answers. 

I thinks thats not true. In my view Ravenclaws would rather be the ones that don‘t make their homework how they supposed to, but rather getting cought up in something mildly relatet to what they were actually supposed to look up in the library.
For example they were told to look up all the ingredients for a potion. But instead they look up one of the ingredients one day and find it so fascinating that they forget the rest and just focus on that one ingredient because it’s so interesting to learn about all the properties. In my opinion that’s more how a Ravenclaws mind works. General interest in learnig not for having all the correct answers but for the learning itself, for cumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge not to brag about it.

(I also think that in every house there are the ones that are very studious and good in class and others that are interestet in other things than being the best student in their class.)

Any Ravenclaws here to confirm my theory? Or are there Ravenclaws out there who totally do not agree with me.

3124,acerthorn,1557979446,"I mean ... it kind of makes no sense that wizards wouldn't congregate around each other. You know, be with their own kind and stuff?

As I read the books, the implication appears to be that Hogsmeade is only able to get away with being an all-magical settlement because of its proximity to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the one wizarding landmark that has to be hidden from muggles at all costs, because if a muggle sees it, that one reveal will instantly blow the wizarding world's cover. All other wizarding landmarks can be seen by muggles and they can be explained away as one contrivance or another. But if a muggle were to lay eyes on Hogwarts, and see children flying around on broomsticks and magical creatures roaming the grounds, there is no way to rationalize in your head what you're seeing. It's a school of magic and that's all there is to it.

So to guard against that, Hogwarts has some of the most extensive anti-muggle enchantments known to wizard kind. Therefore, because of this extensive protection, Hogsmeade is able to be an all-magical settlement because ... well ... muggles *can't* be that close to Hogwarts!

Ok, so that at least makes sense in-universe. The problem isn't so much how Hogsmeade works, but rather, why it's so exclusive.

We see during the Quidditch World Cup that the Ministry is able to set up very extensive anti-muggle enchantments when they set their minds to it. As Arthur Weasley explains ...

&gt; It's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup... It's been a massive organizational problem. The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry's been working on it for months.

So it might take a while for the ministry to set the enchantments up, but if Hogwarts is any indication, once they are set up, they can be maintained indefinitely. Kind of like muggle construction projects. It may take months, maybe even years, for muggles to finally complete a construction project, but once it's finally completed, the building is permanent, and can be lived in forever as long as the owners continue to maintain it.

So ... why don't they do that more often? It would certainly make the whole ""hiding from muggles"" part of wizarding life a whole lot easier, don't you think?",harrypotter,Why is Hogsmeade the only all-magical settlement in Britain?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bp817x/why_is_hogsmeade_the_only_allmagical_settlement/,1557950646.0

Azkaban, on the other hand, is pretty much the opposite.  The Ministry tosses people in there and flushes the key down the toilet.  All the while, the prisoners are being slowly driven insane by the dementors, who feed on everything good in a person's mind and trap them in an endless nightmare of unhappiness and horror, reliving the worst moments of their lives over and over.  Ron described a brief encounter with one as ""like I'd never be happy again.""

So, instead of any attempt at turning criminals back into useful members of society, Azkaban just makes them worse than they were to begin with since they're living an endless nightmare that they can't wake up from.  On the off chance they do escape, they're even more likely to commit repeat offenses since they now have the world's worst case of PTSD.

I know Azkaban is probably meant for the worst criminals in the wizarding world, but still.

Broomstick charms can control the car's hover. If broomstick-related charms can only be applied to long straight objects, like a broom shaft, then they can be applied to the chassis of the car, since that is literally a long, straight piece of steel. 

The steering wheel steers the car, and the accelerator and brake pedals control the speed. Obviously this is beyond a simple hover charm, leading me to believe that the car is controlled by the speed and direction of the wheels, which means that the wheels somehow 'drive' through air.

How exactly would that work, though?

On top of that, what controls the height of the car? The accelerator could control both the speed and height, which would mean the faster you go, the higher you go, and vice-versa, but that doesn't seem very likely.

2. Rupert can speak German, albeit a little, such as numbers or short sentences . Emma can also speak French a bit, thanks to being born in France and spending the early years of her life there, though "" not as well as she used to "" .

3. Rupert and Emma often used to stick "" Kick Me "" signs behind Dan's back as a prank .

4. Dan often liked to play pranks on others during the shooting of the earlier films . He once stole Robbie Coltrane's cellphone and manipulate it so that all the messages were in Turkish . He also scared the make up department crew by putting some ketchup on his face and telling them that he was fighting the other day as a prank .

5. Although in the books, Hermione is the oldest member of the Golden Trio, Emma is in fact the youngest member of the Golden Trio actors, being 1 year younger than Dan and 2 years younger than Rupert .

6. When rereading Deathly Hallows and coming across the chapter "" Kings' Cross "", in which Harry met Dumbledore in the limbo like state and have a conversation with him, Daniel Radcliffe was shocked to find out that during Harry's conversation with Dumbledore, Harry is completely naked . He later jokingly commented about that scene "" It's old hat for me now . "" ( referring to his role in Equus, in which he is completely naked for a short period of time ) . However, that scene was ultimately changed so that Harry does have his conversation with Dumbledore, but he is not naked in DH PT 2 .

7. After the release of the movie adaptation of Philosopher's Stone, an interviewer asked Emma how would she feel like kissing any of her co stars Dan or Rupert, her response was : "" OH MY GOD !!! No, no, no chance . That's not written in my contract ! "" . Ironically, she ended up kissing them both .

8. The "" Seven Potters "" scene in DH PT 1 was a nightmare for Dan to film, as he had to complete 96 shoots to get it done .

9. Dan, Emma and Rupert all share many physical dissmiliarities with their characters, for example, Harry has green eyes and black hair, but Dan has blue eyes and dark brown hair instead . while Emma has Hermione's brown eyes, her natural hair color is light brown while Hermione's is a darker shade of brown, and she has freckles on her face while Hermione doesn't, her freckles were hidden by make up during the movies . Although Rupert is a natural redhead like Ron, he has green eyes while Ron has blue eyes, he is also short and stocky while Ron is tall and lanky .

10. Although Rowling likes Dan, Emma and Rupert and doesn't regret that she allows them to play the characters . She agrees that they were all too good looking for their parts as the characters were supposed to look geeky .

11. In GOF movie, in the scene where Hermione had her Cinderella moment during the Yule Ball, Emma accidentally slipped and fell out of the stairs while filming the scene . Forcing them to do it again .

12. Emma and Rupert's favorite scene in all of the series is the Yule Ball in GOF .

3182,Joe4418,1557894223,"Fifth year-Definitely seems like the toughest not only because it's the O.W.L year which means tons of studying, but trying to decide what career what you want to do after Hogwarts at only 15/16 years old. Also, since it's the year prefects are selected, it may cause rifts among friendships due to jealousy or separation due to the duties that come with it. 

First year-Like any school, the first year will never rank very high on the list. You're stressing over what House you want to be in, you're navigating the school for the first time and are prone to making mistakes with the moving staircases, trick steps, the doorways, etc. This is also likely their first time ever living away from their parents and that can be very hard to get used to at first, especially at only eleven years old. 

Second year-Pretty much the year where
nothing exciting happens at all. You're not new to the school anymore, so that's definitely good. But you're also taking the same classes you took last year and you still can't go to Hogsmeade for another year. Thus, it seems that the second year is the most uneventful year at Hogwarts. 


Seventh year-Some could argue that seventh year should be considered to be the best year at Hogwarts, but like at any school it can be the most depressing because this is the final year. You're saying goodbye to many of your friends and you may feel tentative about pursuing your future after leaving Hogwarts for good. Not to mention the stress of the N.E.W.T exams which will determine if you will end up serving in your career choice. A milestone year, definitely with its low points. 

Third year-This year seems nice. After two years of Hogwarts you're truly settled in and you still don't have much to worry about in terms of your future. You start new classes that you've picked and you experience the joys of Hogsmeade for the first time. Thus this seems like a year with some new things and not a lot of stress. 


Sixth year-Free from the pressure of O.W.L exams and not having to worry about the N.E.W.T exams until the end of seventh year, sixth year is in a good place. All of the classes you take are the ones that interest you for your future career, and you even get some free periods. You may get a lot of work, but at least you do your work knowing that you are working towards a position you wish to strive in for the rest of your life after leaving Hogwarts. 



Fourth year-I'd say it doesn't get much better than in the fourth year. You're right in the middle of your schooling, meaning that you don't have to worry about O.W.L.S, N.E.W.T.S, and deciding what career you'll be doing just yet. You've struck a relative balance with your classes by still taking the ones that are required with the ones that you've chosen. Hogsmeade hasn't gotten old yet. Basically, it seems to me like the most calming year because even though nothing new happens, you've gotten used to all of the Hogwarts norms at this point while still not having to undergo the pressure of later years.

3227,Its_In_Belgium,1557823621,"To start, why did the basilisk ever obey Tom Riddle? 

-He was not of pure blood, and if Slytherin enchanted the basilisk to only obey his true heir, why would he have ever accepted a mere half-blood as his heir? 

Perhaps because, secretly, he was a half blood himself, or maybe he used enchantments that backfired because of a blood-status issue, whether he was knowingly or ignorantly not of pure blood. 

-By that logic, the basilisk should have obeyed Harry, who was every bit of Voldemort as Diary Tom Riddle was, being both a Horcrux AND a half-blood himself.

So, the basilisk had to have rejected Harry based on his ancestry not being of Slytherin, but of Gryffindor, rather than his half-blood status.

-Ginny was of purer blood than Harry or Tom, but for some reason, she was the one taken into the Chamber.

Which, makes no sense besides being the one who was possessed, and also to be a precursor to the “Magic is Might” philosophy of branding blood traitors such as the Weasleys as enemies regardless of heritage.

-Moving on, Diary Tom had no way of proving his ancestry to the basilisk, the most he could do is, like Harry and Ginny, show the basilisk that Diary Tom is the same Tom Riddle who commanded the basilisk previously, and apparently that was good enough for the basilisk.

What we really need is an insight to how Slytherin himself planned for his heir to take up his legacy.

The only explanations I could come up with are as follows:

-Tom Riddle subdued the basilisk himself somehow when he was still in school, which was attempting to reject him as the true Heir being less than of pure Slytherin blood.

-Salazar Slytherin used enchantments that would allow for a half blood Heir to follow in his footsteps, perhaps out of paranoia that pure bloods would be slowly bred out of existence, but that muggle borns could still be “dealt with” by a half blood if necessary. (Which turned out to be exactly what was happening)

-Being an “Heir” was determined by magical ability to confront a basilisk, not by any perceived heritage

-Salazar Slytherin enchanted the basilisk to obey a descendant of pure blood, but that the enchantment determined what was considered “pure” Slytherin blood based on Slytherin’s literal own blood, which, if it was actually half blood, would have allowed Tom Riddle full access to the Chamber and control of the basilisk.

However, it could also be that, like Voldemort and the Gaunts, Salazar had a serious problem with delusions of grandeur, and that it manifested itself in this way because Salazar Slytherin had a lot of influence as a school founder that none of his descendants had again until Voldemort raised the Death Eaters.

Possible Yes/No?

There’s holes in why the basilisk behaved the way it did no matter how it’s spun, the most simple and reasonable being that Tom merely subdued it magically rather than passed some sort of “test”.

Also, suspicions and customs change based on time period, what made you of “pure blood” could have been more easily lied about or claimed ignorantly due to lack of record keeping in low population areas, or other methods of tracking families such as a census or land ownership. 

It basically almost sounds as though whoever had the most money/land called themselves “pure” and joined Slytherin House when the school was founded, probably having a lot of issues proving any of it to Slytherin himself, but the money was there so...party on?",harrypotter,"Salazar Slytherin, could he have been a half blood?",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bogai4/salazar_slytherin_could_he_have_been_a_half_blood/,1557794821.0
3228,15_Redstones,1557820774,"The legend of the Deathly Hallows claims that they were created by Death himself and that the Elder Wand is unbeatable, the Resurrection Stone brings back shades of the dead and the Cloak of Invisibility hides the wearer from anything, including Death.

Now throughout canon we see that this isn't true. It's theorized that the Peverells were just really skilled enchanters who created the Hallows. The Elder Wand isn't unbeatable, otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't have beaten Grindelwald and Draco couldn't have disarmed Dumbledore, it's just really powerful. There are numerous scenes where Harry gets found despite the Cloak, so it doesn't work miracles, it's just a really good invisibility cloak. 

Why should the Resurrection Stone be any different?

It claims that it can bring back the dead, but we don't see any evidence of that, since it's only used on people who were close to the user and a really powerful illusion spell linked to a legilimency spell to show whatever the user expects would result in the same thing. 

And really powerful illusion and invisibility spells on the Stone and the Cloak are probably doable with a really powerful wand, so it's possible that the Peverells were really the inventors of the world's first portable magic amplifier and made up the legend of Death giving them the Hallows to cover up their discovery. 

There's no magic that can bring someone who doesn't have Horcruxes back mentioned anywhere else, so how would the Peverells have started developing it? Illusions on the other hand are used literally everywhere to disguise the Wizarding World. 

It's also worrying that it turns every user completely suicidal. The original Peverell brother in the legend turns suicidal, Dumbledore plans his own death at Snape's hands after acquiring the Stone (and presumably using it to talk with his sister) and Harry walks to his death after using it. If it's creating illusions based on the expectations of the user but designed to make the user suicidal it's perhaps the most dangerous and nasty magical artefact in all of canon.

Why anyone would create such a thing I don't know (except to assassinate an enemy by arranging it for them to find the Stone), but given the magic we know of it's far easier and more probable than actually communicating with the dead, which would be basically impossible once a soul has no ties left to the mortal realm (no Horcruxes, no ghost).

3276,_Winged,1557746875,"A small number of thoughts I had listening to the Deathly Hallows for the umpteenth time.  Curious for opinions.

1. In Deathly Hallows we learn about 'taboo'. What the deatheaters do to you know who's name after taking the ministry. A word/phrase gets cursed. Uttering said word/phrase will break protective enchantments and create a magical disturbance, making the speaker trackable.

WHY didn't the ministry taboo the unforgivable curses? Criminals would be easier to catch, no?

2. DH again: Why do I read people saying on so many places that you know who flying adds nothing... ? 
It's made clear to the readers later on how significant this is. Olivander says: ""yes, if you are any wizard at all you can channel you powers through almost any instrument. The best results however must always be achieved where there is the best affinity between wizard and wand"".

Making clear that 1. You don't ""need"" an instrument. 2. You Know Who flying without enchanted broomstick is immeasurably harder and thus attesting to his prowess. Which is why everyone is surprised.

3282,redmorninglight1116,1557724268,"I’ve been listening to the Stephen Fry narrated audiobooks and I am enjoying the story (again) so very much. I love how I find something new on each read through. 

I just listened to “The Parting of the Ways”, chapter 36 of The Goblet of Fire, and was struck by how poignant the scene where molly hugs Harry is:

“The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to over him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling. 
‘It wasn’t your fault, Harry,’ Mrs Weasley whispered. 
‘I told him to take the cup with me,’ said Harry. 
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away. 
Mrs Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing his face up against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him. 
There was a loud slamming noise , and Mrs Weasley and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.
‘Sorry,’ she whispered.”

Does anyone know why Hermione says sorry? I’ve always interpreted this passage to mean that she intentionally made the sound to break Harry and Molly apart, but I’m not sure why? How does everyone else interpret this scene? 

Also, this has got to be a condenser for one of my favourite scenes in the entire series. The howl of misery..being hugged as if by a mother. So vivid and heartbreaking. Anyone else have any favourites similar to this?",harrypotter,Goblet of Fire scene where Molly hugs Harry...,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bnz8vw/goblet_of_fire_scene_where_molly_hugs_harry/,1557695468.0

The dark magic surrounding Voldemort didn’t scare him he beat Voldemort once before, but this was different he seemed to have a lot more power. Voldemort’s power was now emitting from him,glowing in the darkness, his cold red eyes staring at his own blue eyes.Harry had been watching as Voldemort's had attempted to control everything he saw before him, but he knew what to do this time. Harry had learned from his mistakes during the fist duel, he wouldn’t let Voldemort into his mind. “No! How?” Yelled Voldemort “I can not control you, I can’t get in your mind!” Harry yelled, ”You can’t scare me anymore Voldemort, I know the truth and what you’ve Been through!” Voldemort yelled, “ You know nothing, I don’t need a horcrux to beat you!” Harry calmly spoke, “ I am the master of the deathly hollows, I can beat your whole army alone.” Harry calmly added, “I feel your emotions and I know your scared of me, I see in your head and know you can’t beat me.” Voldemort yelled, “ Avada Kedabra” and aimed at Harry’s head.

Harry pointed his want at his head and said, “ It doesn’t have to be this way.” Voldemort argued, “But, the prophecy said only one can live.” Harry told Voldemort, “Prophecies can be broken.” Harry unblinded Voldemort and He got up.

It was a bit unusual as far as my internet experiences go because the guestbook basically turned into a continuous conversation. There were two American girls, one of which was from Massachusetts.

We were all around 11-15 years old. This was all circa 2001, 2002.

Also how to use skills like logic and reasoning instead of always listening to my heart and emotions. I think being in Ravenclaw would help me acquire these traits while Hufflepuff would only hold me back.

However, I hate to go against Pottermore. I mean it was made by the author herself. Shouldn’t I trust that?

When Harry, Ron and Hermione meet Sirius in Hogsmead and head back to his cave, they tell Sirius every thing of note so far from the story.

3315,velociraptor24,1557686715,"The simple answer is it sorts based off your personality traits. I.E if it senses you have a boldness to you, you go to Gryffindor, and if it senses you have great ambition you go to Slytherin however here’s some problems I have.

1. Does the hat read the literal current thoughts of your 11 year old self or does it predict what you could become in the future? After all people’s personalities often change, especially between the ages of 11 and 18 where they probably have the most radical changes of their whole life. Hermione grew up to be a very brave witch but her 11 year old self was a know it all Ravenclaw.

2. Harry Potter is seen begging not to be sorted into Slytherin despite his personality coinciding with the houses values. Can you simply wish to be in a certain house?

3. What about people who’s personalities don’t really coincide with the four values of bravery, honesty, wisdom, and ambition? 

4. Obvious outliers. Crabbe and Goyle are lazy, un clever, non independent thinkers, and yes men. Yet they are sorted into Slytherin? Peter Pettigrew is extremely cowardly and unrighteous. A far cry from a Gryffindor. 

5. Does the hat sort you by personality or your values?

3374,hanuke,1557630421,"This is going to be a long ride, but stick with me.

-----

Me and a friend have been trying to pin down where, exactly, magic comes from. It's easy in fictional worlds like the [Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle) and the [Old Kingdom](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Old_Kingdom_(book_series\)), where the magic's source is explicitly stated. In WWOHP... magic is just sort of... there.

-----

So what do we know about magic?

It's probably not location-based. Witches and wizards all over the world can cast spells regardless of their location, and probably with the same amount of effort. If not, you'd definitely have some confused international students during Goblet. Based on this, we can assume that magic-users aren't channelling magic from anywhere - it's coming from within. (Unless, of course, they're simply channelling it from the earth itself, in which case - does magic work in space?)

Magic doesn't really work without wands. A magic-user can't cast a spell without a wand, for example. And we know that wands have a sort of sentience to them - the wand chooses the wizard, after all - so maybe they're the source of the magic?

Definitely not. We know that children can use a limited form of magic, long before they have access to a wand. Take any of young Tom Riddle's exploits, or an Obscurial. So, even without a wand, humans - at least magical humans - have some degree of control over magic.

When presented with a wand, suddenly, that human (who up until now could only utilise a raw, weak form of magic) is able to control magic and make it bend to their will. They spend seven years learning how to do so before being sent back into the world.

-----

So what's the difference? How come a wand can cause this change?

A wand is made of two components: a wooden shell, and a magical core. If we assume the wood is mundane, then it's the core that gives wands their magical properties. And these cores are derived from magical creatures - unicorn hair, dragon heartstring, phoenix feather, amongst others. They all have magical creatures in common.

So - in order to control the flow of magic, a magical human requires a tool made from a piece of a magical creature.

-----

So what makes these creatures magical? How do they get their magic?

At this point we have to throw away our ""magic comes from within"" theory, because whatever we come up with here, it has to apply to humans and creatures alike. All animals must channel magical energy to some extent. In humans this manifests as chaotic destructive power. In unicorns, this manifests as cursed blood. In dragons, fire breath, presumably.

These animals must all be attuned to some sort of baseline magic somehow. And here's how: genetics. If there's some cell back in the protozoic era that managed to evolve to tap into some universal magic energy, hell, why wouldn't that be evolutionarily selected for? That gene gets passed down through the generations to all sorts of different creatures. Some species get it, some don't. Yay for centaurs, nay for horses. Magical creatures, over time, will evolve to be more magical, to be better as a species at tapping into this energy. And in humans - and therefore probably all other species too - some get the gene and some don't. Those that don't are called Muggles. They are mundane. They can't tap into the magical background energy.

And that explains Mudbloods and Squibs, too. Just because that gene is present doesn't mean it will always be expressed. Sometimes it'll hide in generations and only show itself once every few decades. Sometimes it won't show up at all, even when both parents are pureblood.

So humans, being the dominant species and having thumbs, kill these magical animals to make tools that will allow them to channel their magic better. Yeah, that seems to match human history pretty well.

-----

But why do we need wands?

What if we could control magic without them?

And this is where house elves come in. They're another magical creature. They have access to a huge range of magic, and it's literally right at their fingertips. They're able to bypass spells that have been placed by wands and - without any tool to constrain them - do literally whatever they want.

But that's not the case, is it? Because almost all house elves are bound to a human master. They're slaves, and are forced to act within a tiny box, only pushing the boundaries of the last command they were given.

When a house elf does perform magic, it's through [sheer force of will](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/House-elf_magic), through intent. They're not restricted to spells like wand-users are.

And yet the magic they use is the same. When Dobby levitates a cake in the Dursley household, the Trace picked that up as the Hover Charm, which is a spell that wand-users can use. Dobby was using the exact same piece of magic as a spell.

From this we can draw two assumptions:

1. That spells are a way of selecting a very specific piece of magic, which is then channelled using the wand by a wand-user.

2. That house-elves have unrestricted access to all of magic.

Based on this, it may be the case that humans - even magical ones - are very weak magical creatures, who need magically supplementing in order to be magically useful. House elves, however, are extremely powerful.

-----

So... why not use part of a house elf as a wand core?

It makes sense, right? Unicorns, dragons and phoenixes are all well and good, but they're not as insanely powerful as an elf. Why not elf heartstring? Surely that would make for a far more powerful wand core?

Ethics aside - a dark wizard who's truly dedicated to power would try this at some point. The question is - why hasn't anyone?

Is it because they simply think it's abhorrent?

Perhaps because house elves just don't make very good wands?

Or maybe it's because... they literally can't?

-----

Here's my proposal:

Humans are evil. They're nasty, lying, manipulative pieces of work who'll stop at nothing to be more powerful.

Elves are good. They're helpful and hardworking, and each of them just wants the best. They don't mind being used, they just want to be productive. They're cut out to be the planet's dominant species. They're the ones who'll make leaps and bounds in technological and magical development.

And then everything fell apart when the humans invented wands.

Suddenly, the humans are a tangible threat. They're armed and have access to magical power. Sure, it's far weaker than elf magic, but it's magic nonetheless, and you can never underestimate the lengths a human will go to to get the upper hand. And worse - they want to put pieces of elves inside their wands.

So an elf thinks, ""hang on a second... no thank you!"" and they go over to the humans and say ""now hold up there one second laddies. I don't like the thought of you lot trampling all over my culture and my people. In fact, I won't allow it.""

And the humans say ""ok buddy. what are you gonna do about it?""

And the elf thinks for a moment and says, ""ok, how about this. you lot promise to not put any of my people in your wands. ever. for the rest of time. and we'll give you something in return.""

And the human says ""ok. we'll never do that, if you promise to make your whooole species a slave to our species, forever."" And as they say that, they look behind them, laughing at their buddies, knowing that there's no way this elf is gonna agree to that.

And the elf says ""yeah, sure. so long as there's a way for each elf to get out of the deal.""

The human is shocked, but agrees, suggesting that the elf will be freed if their human master gives them clothes (if nothing else then just for the humiliation of the thought of these elves never ever being able to wear clothes). And the elf, fearful for its live and that of its people, agrees.

Then they shake hands. And the combination of human and elf magic sends ripples through time and space, sealing this Unbreakable Vow not only for this specific couple but for both of their species. Forever.

1- A murder (or at least an attempt to);

2 - A group to investigate (the golden trio / detectives);

3- A group with more investigative power, but that cannot solve the case (Dumbledore and the other teachers / cops in any noir film);

4- The choice of a very dark color in the film photograph;

5- The low luminosity (only candles and torches);

6- Much of the investigation takes place at night;

7- Walking in the halls of Hogwarts at night (makes it seem that they are walking in alleys and streets in a city);

8- The ever-present sensation of humidity and rain;

9- Sewers (I remembered The Third Man);

10- An old story of another murder that has never been solved.

The stone presented itself to Harry in the Mirror of Erised because he sought to keep it from Voldemort, not because he himself wanted to become immortal; likewise, Harry was able to master the Hallows (and, ultimately, death) because he did not seek to run from death (like Voldemort), but because he instead (like the third brother) greeted death as an old friend in the Forbidden Forest when his time had come.

Harry's purity of heart with the philosopher's stone was proof that he would be able to master the hallows at the tale's end.

Me and a few local people have had an idea to restore the grave stone or replace it with a replica at the same location.

I have started a Just giving and would really appreciate anyone sharing or helping the cause.

The funds will be used to find a similar stone to the prob and for a mason to carve the writing. (or even to get the original. that would be amazing!)

I'll also pick up the books asap! I have no idea what the majority opinion as I was staying away from the community until finishing the series. So hello all!

1. Prisoner of Azkaban: Super cool and mind blowing puzzle, I love the tension Sirius creates throughout and then throws a curveball by him being a good guy, I just love everything about this film.

2. Sorcerer's Stone: The first time magic is all here, pun intended, you get to experience the awesome school and characters for the first time and it's just so charming.

3. Deathly Hallows Part 2: I'm a big Star Wars fan, and this kinda hit home with the grand scheme in place and all the action and cinematography. Snape and Voldemort give fantastic performances. I am sad there was not as much Ron and Hermione as I would've hoped for, but overall I still think this is my #3.

I hate to admit it, but he has a point. None of the other aurors we've seen, either in HP or the Fantastic beast movies were visibly scarred up like that.

3545,acerthorn,1557477477,"So in this video ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmkRzT90LWA ... Ben of the SuperCarlinBrothers wonders if there are any restrictions on what information can be hidden using the Fidelius Charm. He then goes on to suggest ""like, for instance ... how do use a door knob!""

That certainly does sound like the ultimate dick move that an Internet troll might try and pull. But I have a reasonable fan theory that not only defeats that theory, but is totally consistent with how the fidelius charm is used throughout the series.

First ... when hiding an inanimate object, you can only hide specific inanimate objects. Second, the legal owner of that inanimate object must consent to having it hidden away.

Think about it: The first instance we hear of the Fidelius Charm is the hiding of the Potters' Cottage. That cottage was eligible for fidelius charm protection ... because James Potter allowed it to be!

Later, we see 12 Grimmauld Place protected by the fidelius charm. Again, its own (Sirius) allowed his home to be protected this way.

In Deathly Hallows, after the battle of Malfoy Manor, most homes owned by Order members are protected by the Fidelius Charm with Arthur Weasley as secret-keeper. Again, nobody is having their home protected against their will.

So going back to Ben Carlin's example of a door knob being hidden by a fidelius charm ... my theory is that, first of all, the owner of that door would first have to consent to having the knowledge of how to use his door hidden, and second, the charm would only conceal the knowledge of how to use *that one specific door knob.* For every other door knob in the world, the knowledge of how to use them would still be publicly available, and because their owners aren't consenting to the protection, the caster of that charm couldn't hide that information away, even if he wanted to. So it still can't be used as the ultimate act of trollism.

As I was typing this thread, I noticed that this also inadvertently clears up a plothole in Deathly Hallows. After the Battle of Malfoy Manor, Dobby teleports Harry &amp; Co. to outside Bill Weasley's house. Harry sees bodies moving around inside the house and calls for help. But if Bill was the secret-keeper, Dobby couldn't have revealed the location to Harry, nor could Harry have seen inside the house on his own accord.

However, this suddenly makes sense if we accept that the thing that was hidden wasn't the location of the house itself, but rather, the knowledge of how open the front door. When Bill comes out to respond to Harry's pleas for help, he demonstrates how to open the door to Harry, and so everyone present learns that knowledge. Meanwhile, concealing even that knowledge is still enough to keep the death eaters out. We read about how some death eaters are stationed outside 12 Grimmauld Place in the hopes of catching a glimpse of where it is by an Order member, so like with 12 Grimmauld Place, Bill Weasley's cottage might already be under surveillance by death eaters, but it won't make a lick of difference if they *can't enter the damn thing.*

3547,acerthorn,1557475737,"I suppose with the adults, it makes some sense. They actually have personal memories of Voldemort at the height of his power.

But what about the kids who are Harry's age? They just know Voldemort as a historical figure. I know all the terrible things Hitler did, but if you say his name, I'm not going to cringe in fear.

Is it supposed to remind people of all the terrible atrocities he committed? If so, how does saying ""You-know-who"" or ""the dark lord"" or ""he-who-must-not-be-named"" avoid bringing up those painful memories?

The absolute closest I can think of to a muggle analogue for this is the N-word. That racial slur is the one thing 99.99999999% of non-racists refuse to say, even if they are totally comfortable saying every other expletive under the sun. Even message boards that allow you to say fuck, shit, and bitch will still either censor the N-word with astericks or not allow you to submit the post at all if the post contains it.

But that has less to do with fear of any specific Hitler analog, and a lot more to do with how degrading it is to a certain ethnic group. Dumbledore isn't advocating for people to start using the N-word because that's Voldemort's proper name, and fear of the N-word only increases fear of black people themselves.

So even then, it still isn't a perfect fit.

3561,wolfgirlmusic,1557452122,"(Not my own theory, someone else posted this in my HP group on FB) : Willy Wonka is George Weasley:
After the events of the books, George used wizard time-travel technology (that is, the Time-Turner, a device that is used once and never mentioned again) to go back and start a new life under a new identity.  And don't give us any guff about all the Time-Turners being destroyed, Harry Potter nerds -- we both know that at least one is floating around the black market, assuming J.K. Rowling hasn't already retconned a few back in. Before George’s brother Fred died  the twins opened a successful toy and candy shop called Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes. One of their most popular items was the Skiving Snackbox, candy that would give you a temporary nosebleed or vomiting fit so you could get out of class. In other words, the Weasleys had mastered magic that lets candy physically alter a human being. Like, say, turning someone into a blueberry. Aside from their candy-making capabilities, there’s also their physical similarities. They’re both redheads with a showman’s sense of fashion. And there’s this little aside Wonka makes to Mike Teavee: ""I'm a trifle deaf in this ear. Speak a little louder next time."" Maybe Wonka’s just being snarky … or maybe it’s a reference to the fact that George lost an ear battling Death Eaters. He may have been able to alter one of his Extendable Ears to serve as a prosthetic, but he couldn’t repair all the actual hearing damage. Then, there are the Oompa Loompas, who are basically slaves who work for chocolate. In Wonka's relatively realistic world, they make no sense, and he dodges the question of their origins. But, in George's magical world, such creatures are commonplace. Heck, little orange men who work their hearts out for no reward are basically creepier house-elves. A resourceful wizard such as George could certainly rustle up a few magical followers.

Now, here's where it gets both oddly convincing and extremely sad. Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is such a weird film that you probably just took this in stride, but wasn't it creepy that everything in Wonka's office was chopped in half for no apparent reason? Well, maybe that's because George only considers himself half a man without his twin. Wonka's motivations look heartbreaking now. He's not just searching for an heir to his business -- he's looking to replace his dead brother. That's why he hates every kid except Charlie -- they're rich, stupid, and cruel, three qualities that members of the Weasley family don't share.",harrypotter,Theory : Willy Wonka is George Weasley,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bms8qs/theory_willy_wonka_is_george_weasley/,1557423322.0

3583,TeAomihia,1557439518,"I like to think had not Alan died there would have been another film. Severus didn't really die, and they'd delve into his ""love affair"" with Lily; I like to imagine Snape was Potter's real father.
 Harry had his MOTHER'S (fine sighted) eyes. Not James' - Harry's wearing of glasses could have been a physiological result of his way of connecting with his dad, yearning for the father figure so much that he tricked his brain into thinking he needed them (just like his ""dad"").
 Or he didn't get poor eyesight genetically, rather as after-effects of Voldemort's spell. I like to imagine Snape carrying baby Harry out of the bedroom, pausing at James where Harry open and closes his hand, Snape kneels down and Harry whacks on James' glasses - Snape gives them to Harry. As Harry grows he never drops them and as soon as he can fit them he starts wearing them. 
He could've had poor eyesight magicked upon him so that it seemed he was like ""James"" (to himself and everyone else) but again, he had his mother's eyes - not his poor sighted ""father's"" - this could've been done to steer him from pursuing his true father, Snape - who wasn't allowed to know the truth (that Dumbledore knew) because it would pose too much of a threat to his ability to protect Harry safely without ""disciplined emotions."" And Dumbledore wouldn't risk Snape not eventually letting his own son die. 
Dumbledore WAS there at the Potter's that night, but when he accidentally failed to save James, he let Lily die - she couldn't go to Snape and tell him the truth for fear it would screw up his plans ""...she and James put their faith in the wrong person.""
The real reason Snape despised Harry's likeliness to James was not because of the bullying, it was because he was a ""swine"" who took his lover of whom, he, ""arrogant and lazy"", failed to protect. Ultimately he hated the sight of Harry because Harry was meant to be HIS son. His bit of individual spite stems from his first meeting with the boy in class where Harry fails to give attention to the him, man who worked to have him kept safe, and will do so for a very long time. And every time he sees Harry in his glasses he hates himself for being such a fool and giving in to the child as his basically having to face James everyday is a result of his own doing. 
I imagine Snape goes into hiding leaving everyone to think he's dead. Harry has ongoing problems after the war such as still talking to Snakes - this shouldn't be however as a part of Voldemort no longer lives within him - Harry goes on the mish to find out why (why being because his FATHER can talk to snakes). 
We delve into Severus' everything, his childhood even, and amongst other things what brings him out of hiding is that his treatment of Harry is just like Severus' father's treatment of himself. He realises. But stuff happens and it's an epic journey of recounts and flashbacks and battles and drama and DELICIOUS FUCKING SEVERUS and whatever.

Remember, these are what ""I like to think."" :) I apologise for the hastily written rant lol. Also, please don't hate me, but I've not read the books. I've heard they differ from the movies - especially the overall character of Severus Snape - I do not yet wish to tarnish the way I see the characters, especially him, yet. My rant is therefore unrelated to the books.

...And, on another note, in relation to their Patronuses - Lily &amp; Severus share the same as they are one, they have true love. Had James truly been her true love, would not his patronus turn to a Doe, or her's to a stag? 
Lily and Severus: doe (also a testament the deep and somewhat motherly care and love individually had by the pair)

3589,PruxterdMarc,1557435791,"Hey guys!

(Sorry if my english is bad, it's not my first language and I don't usually speak it)

I just created an account just to post this here. Pls read everything. You can ask me any question about it.

I'm Marc, I live in Spain and I'm actually a wizard. I've known that since 16 yo and never told anyone. My first sign of magic was when my twin brother was bothering me while I was on my computer. He was standing on my door while singing, just to anoy me. I just turned arround to face him but at the exact moment the door closed on his face without me touching it. My brother and I were just freaked out but he rapidly forgot and didn't care that much because it was a hot day and we had the windows opened. But for me something was wrong. I've always been very sensitive with this type of things, I didn't believe in magic and had strong opinions in this ""esoteric"" stuff, but my mom believes a lot in this things and she always tells me how I am like her. We both have sleep paralysis (I know it's common in other people but it's a thing that always made me reflect in the stuff my mother believes), and we both have experienced anecdotes like the one above.

Well, I didn't pay much more attention in the Incident that happened with my brother until I was home alone one afternoon and went to the kitchen to grab a snack. When I entered the kitchen, I stomped my foot with the leg from the table we have there and it hurt so bad I closed my eyes and grabbed my foot. When I opened my eyes, every single closet on the kitchen was opened. That day was the day I ran the fastest in my life (I was very scared). My mom thought it had something to do with ""bad energy"" so she brought some friends to make like a ""clean up"" idk.

It was at that point i was very confused. I started searching stuff on the internet and one day I found a website that talked about magic (which looked a bit false in my opinion). One ad on the web was about the Harry Potter saga. I have a lot of friends who like HP but I've never been interested on it, until that moment. A week later I bought the first book and instantly fell in love with the HP universe. But somethig told me I had the ""symptoms"" of a wizard.

The time passed and then I turned 17. I lost a bit of my passion for HP and moved out from It for a while, until 2 weeks before my birth day (now I'm 18). I was with my father at home. My brother was in his room and I was playing the piano in the living room while my father was on his phone on the couch. My mother was at the supermarket. Someone knocked on the door, and my father stood up to open it since I was playing the piano, but I stopped. My father was talking with someone in the door so I wanted to hear what they were saying. Turns out the man who knocked on the door was looking for me. My father let him in while looking weird at me. The man came to me and shaked my hand. He was dressed in a kinda old suit and had grey short hair. He asked (iif he could talk to me and my parents so we seayed in the couch waiting for my mother.
My mom finally arrived and the man stood up and said hello to her. He speaked in spanish but you could notice it was not his first language (he speaked english). When we all sat down we all looked at the man. He started by saying that he knew the whole situation was odd but that he had something very important to say about me. 

He just said: ""Your son Marc, is a wizard"". My parents looked at me weird and then looked at the man who continued by introducing himself. He told us his name was Michael Nicholas Ainsworth. He told us he was a teacher on a school in Scotland (he didn't tell us exactly where) named Pruxterd, and that he was sent here to explain to me and my family that I was a wizard. We started asking the questions anyone would ask in this situation. He answered everything. I asked a lot of questions, like if he knew something about HP. He told us J.K. Rowling was a ""muggle"" who accidentally discovered the magical world which is hidden to the muggle eye to avoid problems. He said that that was a long story but in a nutshell he said that Rowling was hired to reveal the magical world to the muggles by writting a story with lots of information that wizards provided to her. They did that because if muggles thought the wizarding world was a story they wouldn't believe things they saw or at least they would not relate them to the wizarding world. He also said that Pruxterd was a school for wizards over the age of 18.

To finish, Ainsworth casted some spells. He grabbed a wand from the inside of his sleeve and pointed it to the candle we have at the table in the living room. The candle started floating in the air and we couldn't beleive that. At that moment I think my father knew the man wasn't joking because he asked: ""And how much does this cost?"". Ainsworth said that it was free but we had to provide money for the school supplies. 

(I'm going to finish this up because it might hurt to read and because I think it's long enough)

To wrap this up before he left he told me to go to london 1 week before the 1th of September to start learning about the wizarding world and to buy the school supplies before actually going to school. He left me a note with all the stuff I needed to buy in London. He also said he would be waiting us when we arrive to guide us on everything.

I know you guys would not believe this so if you have any questions I will gladly answer them! :) I will also be updating with new things.

tl;dr: I'm actually a wizard and I'm going to be a pupil on a school named Pruxterd. A man came to my house to explain everything and he performed magic tricks.

So we all know JK is a master wordsmith when it comes to naming her characters... I'm listening to the HP books again via audiobooks and I'm listening to book 2 where Harry meets Fawkes. So this has got me thinking.

Fawkes is an awesome Phoenix name anyway, and a quick Google search shows the origin as 'falcon' which is fitting for, you know, a majestic bird.

But i've always assumed Fawkes was a reference to Bonfire Night/Guy Fawkes Night. Again obvious reference of fire to the firebird. 

BUT basically this means that Dumbledore's pet is named after one of British history's most famous rebels. Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Westminster Palace with gunpowder. He failed, but this is weirdly celebrated every November with fireworks.

Antioch uses the Elder Wand to challenge other wizards in duels and after defeating them all, continuously bragged about the Elder Wand's power, resulting in him getting killed in his sleep by another wizard for the possession of the Elder Wand .

Cadmus uses the Stone to bring his lost love back to life, but she didn't belong to the mortal world and as a result, Cadmus, devastated, commits suicide in order to join his love in the afterlife

Ignatius was safe from danger as the Invisibility Cloak kept him hidden from those who seek the Hallows, later, late in life he passed the Cloak to his son and "" greeted Death like an old friend ""

What I'm trying to say is that, imo, Voldemort is like Antioch, Snape is like Cadmus and Harry is like Ignatius : both Voldemort and Antioch were wizards who were arrogant and too confident on their abilities, they continually bragged about their power and superiority and wanted even more power and ended up getting killed for their lust for power .

Cadmus and Snape were both wizards who ended losing the love of their respective lifes and died for their lost love . Cadmus tried to resurrect his love with the Resurrection Stone but when she wasn't able to live in the mortal world, Cadmus killed himself in order to join her in the afterlife . After Lily died, Snape dedicated the rest of his life to protecting her son, all due to his loyalty and love for her and died in doing so .

Harry and Ignatius were wizards who never seeked power and instead settled on having a normal life . They never feared death and when they were going to die, they greeted death like an old friend .

Since some time I have been listening to the Potterless podcast (r/potterless) when I am walking to work, and it’s been great. It’s funny, a great recap to the books and the series, and it’s also a great way to understand how certain parts, elements, and characters hold up throughout time and from the perspective of an adult. 

Having read the books as children, and then understanding them with the broadened worldview and a better appreciation of the darker elements of the books and the flaws of several characters. I would recommend everyone to listen to it, and challenge your own notions about characters, plots, events etc.

The podcast gives you an opportunity to hear a fresh take on the books from an unbiased standpoint (other than when Quidditch is mentioned – the most hilarious rants ensue!!). But it also discusses the practical issues with the magical world, draws parallels to our reality and world around us. At the end of the day, humans in the wizarding world are essentially like humans in the real world, the principles of behaviour and interactions are the same. 

Especially for people who try and justify Snape, or James, or Sirius, or any other widely and passionately disputed character. These three characters for me have been the most complex and often problematic characters. Snape’s behaviour being the most unacceptable (my opinion, don’t come at me with justifications for his behaviours, there are no justifications for being so emotionally abusive to children as an adult to the point where you become their greatest fear! Also, I don't want the comments to turn into an argument.) 

James and Sirius are also incredibly problematic, in many parts of the narrative, this is also discussed unabashedly and without any inclination to defend them with bias. As are several other characters (Dumbledore, Percy, etc, even Harry!) And of course the obvious terrible people like Umbridge. 

Whether you agree with the opinions or not, that is up to you, but it is still a great listen, and a fresh perspective that you can ponder over.

But Voldemort above all else fears death, that is why he creates the Hocruxes and why he tries to hunt down Harry relentlesly. Harry represents the possibility of his demise and the Hocruxes secures that he can’t die.

&amp;#x200B;

Would a basilisk's gaze (you know, insta-death to anyone who looks it in the eye) do anything to a nundu, or would the nundu just ignore it and carry on its merry way? Basilisks are not known for being easy to kill, but a nundu, according to all the records/notes I've seen anywhere, are supposed to be even worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I believe a nundu would likely just shrug the gaze off and continue murdering everything in sight. Seems like something it would do, and fits in with the whole '100 wizards vs giant disease leopard: leopard wins' thing nundus have going on. If 100 wizards is a stretch to kill/capture one, a nundu just ignoring a basilisk's gaze fits right in with the total lack of vulnerabilities they show. In addition, I rather doubt a venom/poison of any kind (basilisk included) would do anything to a nundu either, being the giant disease leopards they are.

This podcast is a husband and wife couple, and the husband had never consumed any Harry Potter material.  They are going through watching the movies and then producing about a 1 hour long segment about each movie.  

I thought it was interesting for a few reasons:

1) The wife who grew up with the books/movies stands in for all fans having a conversation with a brand new one.

2) It's really interesting seeing an adults perspective coming to it fresh and just reacting.  Definitely was a new angle.

3) The podcasts are lengthy, but I appreciated that gave them space to really explore everything.

I've been writing a series on the First Wizarding War for the fun of it. It includes everything from the Marauders, the Order of the Phoenix, and Voldemort's rise to power. I was desperate for a series, so I'm writing what I think would have happened. There's so much to explore and I think it's so intriguing. Many usually say they want a Marauders story, and while the story has a lot of that, I really wanted to focus on the war itself. But, to commemorate our favourite mischief makers, the series starts in 1971 (the year the Marauders began Hogwarts) and will eventually take us all the way to 1981.

It's all in script format, but I wrote it to be more reader-friendly. It's a bit of glorified fanfiction, but hey, at least we can enjoy ourselves while at it. I'm currently posting S2 and writing S3. S1 is all ready and available to read.

It's called ""Rise of the Phoenix"". You can check it out here:

I know, many fans try to justify such a nonsense as Minerva McGonagall in 1927. I even found several essays of exusing... I remember that time when Pottermore give us correct date of her birth - 4 october 1935. 

Also, I can't count FB2 as new canon at least because it is direct opposition to Pottermore stats. Albus Dumbledore was her Transfiguration teacher, and Albus from FB2 teach DADA! So, let's just accept, whole Hogwarts thing in FB2 is big plothole, Easter egg only for Easter egg.

3744,acerthorn,1557279728,"Now, some of you might go for the obvious explanation: The scar was a piece of Voldemort's soul. It was what made Harry into a horcrux. Horcruxes have a self-preservation instinct, and since Harry's scar often flared up when Voldemort was nearby (aka when Harry himself was in mortal peril) that meant that the horcrux inside him was freaking out over the impending danger.

However, that doesn't gel well with the behavior we see of other horcruxes. Specifically, if that were the case, then Harry's scar should have hurt in other cases where he was in danger of dying but which Voldemort wasn't directly involved in, like with the two dementor attacks in the climax of PoA and the first chapter of OotP.

Heck, even in situations where Voldemort was *indirectly* responsible for Harry's immediate danger (such as being attacked by the giant spider in the Third Task, a danger that Voldemort didn't specifically plan but it was his fault that Harry was even subject to in the first place), Harry's scar is usually fine.

Most other horcruxes usually react whenever they are put in *any* mortal peril whatsoever. They appear to have some means of naturally perceiving a threat and improvising a response accordingly. For example, in Deathly Hallows, when Harry finds the Sword of Gryffindor in a lake, the horcruxes can sense the sword being nearby and tightens itself around Harry's neck, causing him to nearly drown. It's very unlikely that Voldemort had accounted for that specific scenario (""If someone is wearing you around their neck while they're underwater diving for an artifact that can kill you"") and enchanted a response for such a very specific scenario. It is infinitely more likely that the horcrux (being self-aware, seeing as it's a soul fragment) used its self-awareness to put two and two together, and came up with the choking response on its own, without any input from Voldemort's directly.

So if that's the way that horcruxes usually behave when they are in mortal peril, then Harry's horcrux should have acted up whenever Harry was in any danger at all, regardless of the source. Instead, it only acts up when Voldemort is either nearby or gaining power.

Hell, for that matter, horcruxes tend to actively act in a way that prevents their own destruction, like with the aforementioned underwater strangulation scene. They don't just flair up or start pounding away like a heartbeat; they actually fight for their own survival. Harry's scar, however, didn't do anything except cause pain. The closest the scar pain ever got to doing something tangible was causing Harry to practically become blinded by the pain. But even that is unlikely to be horcrux behavior, seeing as that put its host (Harry) at a survival *disadvantage,* which is the exact opposite of what horcruxes are supposed to do.

So all things considered, we can safely assume that Harry's scar pain is not simply because the scar is a horcrux.

So that begs the question ... what was the deal with his scar pain?",harrypotter,Why did Harry's scar burn?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/blzb0n/why_did_harrys_scar_burn/,1557250928.0

That's a basic sketch I came up with. The idea was to use the Lumos font on a sort of scroll/banner looking thing. I kind of prefer having the harder lines rather than a curled and more ornate scroll like in some other illustrations. 

The main thing I'm not sure about is spacing. Having even lengths of the banner like that appeals to me, but it means there's a lot of empty space on the second line in particular since there's less text.

3838,acerthorn,1557196376,"In Deathly Hallows, we finally get an explanation as to why Petunia hates the magical world: She was super jealous that her sister Lily got to be a witch but she didn't. She developed a lifelong hatred of the magical world as a means of being in self-denial about her jealousy.

So what about Vernon? Has Rowling ever given his backstory that caused him to hate wizards?

The closest I've ever heard is that Vernon was having lunch with James one day, he asked James what kind of car he drove, and when James described his broomstick, Vernon felt insulted, like he was being played for a fool.

That's ... honestly kind of shallow, don't you think? I mean, that sounds like the sort of thing that could easily be fixed with a simple apology. Sure, James was an arrogant jackass as a kid. We see as much in OotP, Chapter 28 (""Snape's Worst Memory""), but Lupin and Sirius explain to Harry that Lily fell in love with James after James had matured up. So by the time he and Vernon are meeting, it seems odd that James would have made no effort to apologize for offending Vernon and clarify what he was saying.

But even if James never did that, it feels kind of shallow of Vernon to assume that literally every witch or wizard in existence was arrogant to the point of seeing muggles as inferior. When was the last time you met one person who was a part of any group, who you met only once in your entirely life, and developed a lifelong hatred of everyone in that group as a result of that one interaction?

3851,kmichaelle,1557186432,"So my bf and I went to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at USH recently and we spent the drive home contemplating things we would like to see in the future. I realize there are a billion logistical issues for why certain things can't happen such as space, wait time, etc, but anyway:

1) A sorting ceremony in the Three Broomsticks. 

I know it would break canon as the sorting ceremony happens in the Great Hall, but anyway. Wouldn't it be a fun attraction if, as you are eating your bangers and mash, you watch people getting sorted into houses? It'd be even better if the hat was a puppet and the person placing the hat on your head was a rad ventriloquist. Then you'd be able to whisper ""\[House that you want\]!"" a la' Movie #1 and sort of choose your own house in the way that Harry did, rather than it being totally random like the hat that you can buy and try on in Filch's Emporium. Of course that would be a somewhat secret that you would need to know prior to being sorted, otherwise the hat would just shout out a random house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Certainly it would be hard for the person holding the hat to hear you, and there's already not enough room in the Three Broomsticks for people to eat a rush hour but it'd still be cool asf

&amp;#x200B;

2) A Third Task maze...maybe in the style of a corn maze-meets-laser tag?

OK,  I know corn mazes and haunted houses take forever at small community fairs, but this could be SO FUN. Especially if you and your crew get wands at the beginning of the maze that act like laser tag guns. There could be  blast-ended skrewts and scary things that boggarts would turn into (dementors, werewolves, giant spiders)   that you have to ward off with your wand and that would disappear into the bushes when you've hit them with your laser wand (they could wear something like laser tag vests that light up to let you know you've hit them). Also, puzzles in the style of the riddle that the sphinx reads to help you get through shortcuts. Plenty of employees standing in the shadows to make sure everything goes well (like in the Walking Dead haunted house-style attraction). I'm not sure how I would want it to end, as the Third Task ended with a dead kid and Voldemort rising out of a soup... maybe fighting off Voldemort and the Death Eaters with your wand? They could be harder bosses that take more hits before going down than the boggarts.

3866,Morvack,1557175314,"Hello everyone, I had an odd but interesting thought about Horace Slughorn. The accepted story is that Horace Slughorn somehow not only knew what a horcrux was, but how to make one. 

But why? Why does he know that? He has very much been painted as being a master of potions. He can make Felix Felicis. He is the one who taught Snape about potions. He probably makes polyjuice in his sleep. Even in retirement, it has been implied he keeps up with back ally transactions for potions ingredients. He eats, sleeps, and breaths potions.

A horcrux on the other hand, is insanely dark magic created by Herpo the foul. The original creator of horcruxes, the three unforgivable courses, and basilisks. So why does old professor Slughorn know how to make them?

Theory: Slughorn was going to make one himself. 

To bring back someone from a soul fragment to a physical form, you need a rudimentary body **Potion** . To recover from the weak physical form of the rudimentary body **Potion**, you need a Regeneration **Potion**. A Regeneration **Potion** is an ""old piece of dark magic, the potion that revived me tonight."" -Voldemort. 

Assuming all of the above is accepted as reasonable, we must now ask why?

It could be that he is so self serving, he would even engage such a dark piece of magic to survive.

He likes being comfortable. Death is probably not that comfortable. if he could live forever, engaging in his favorite hobby of collecting famous people and gaining favors from them, why wouldn't he?

In the scene near the end when Dumbledore is giving Hermione instructions to save Sirius, he already knows that they succeeded.

Since the timeline isn’t altered through time travel and Harry and Hermione “in the past” had always affected the present, Dumbledore would have just seen Buckbeak disappear from Hagrid’s hut and knowing about Hermione’s time turner likely had pieced together that she was responsibility. Hence the line, “if you succeed more than one innocent life may be spared.” He already knew that Buckbeak had been spared. 

Like I said, I’m sure everyone else realized this but still wanted to share lol. I had always understood that he knew about Hermione’s time turner but it wasn’t until my rewatch yesterday when I realized he already knew Buckbeak was alive when he was saying all that.

TLDR; found a niffler theme a few months back. Can't find it again. Does anyone know of it?

Hi all! So, right after Fantastic Beasts 2 came out, I managed to find a BEAUTIFUL niffler samsung theme (unofficial, of course, much like the other Potter themes I've found in the themes store -- though they're few and far between and most are of dubious quality -- this one was gorgeous and one of the few that wasn't). However, I bought a snowy Hogwarts theme instead, since it was nearing Christmas at the time. Or else I'd just been accepted into the Disney College Program and bought a beautiful stained glass mosaic beauty and the beast and comic/pop art style Cinderalla themes instead and couldn't justify buying a third. I can't remember which it was, but the movie might've come out /after/ Christmas, in which case it was the latter.

In any event, I thought I had saved the theme to my ""wanted list"" so I would be able to find it later, but it seems to have disappeared. I'm not sure if I removed it from my list by accident or if it was deleted because of a copyright strike (although it wasn't branded a niffler theme; it was called a platypus or hedgehog theme or something else and the other Potter themes I've found in the themes store are still up and there are many unofficial Harry Potter game apps in the Google Play store that remain up, some of which even use ""Harry Potter"" in the name). I had (and still have, to my dismay) a cute Easter egg theme up for the holiday, which has sense past, and am looking to switch again to a new (Harry Potter) one. But not my winter one. My plan was to buy the niffler one because I love nifflers dearly, to the point where I even have my room decorated in nifflers merch. Nerdy, I know, but I like what I like.

However, when I checked my ""saved"" themes list it wasn't there and I tried all the relevant search terms I could think of but couldn't find it in the Samsung themes store. I was wondering if anyone else might know of this theme/be able to link to it, since themes can sometimes be hard to find in the store, unless you know the name of them (I can't seem to remember the name of this one and a Google search turned up nothing, to my great frustration)? And if it was, indeed, deleted, did anyone buy it beforehand who might be able/willing to provide a download link (not piracy if it's no longer for sale), since the Samsung phones allow you to download games and apps from the web in a way that apple devices do not without being jail broken?

If it helps, I believe the theme was mostly black with a red curtain accent and the niffler was holding a red gem, I believe? The lock screen swipe page was decorated such that themes appeared when you drew your designated shape, if I correctly recall.",harrypotter,Can't find old Harry Potter niffler theme!

It has come to my attention that there is a certain trivia question causing some consternation among certain fans of this series, and without coming out and actually answering it directly, I figured I'd share some information that will help those who may be stuck solve it, and to help educate (or provide a refresher course on the subject for those who already know) the general public on the subject of magical birds.

The answer to this one is found in the companion book *""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them""* by Newt Scamander. If you've memorized it like an obsessive, then you'll know off the top of your head that the Augury is called ""the Irish Phoenix,"" its cry was once believed to portend death (but in reality portends rain), and its feathers are particularly unsuitable to being used as quills as they repel ink.

The Fwooper, meanwhile, is native to Africa, it's known for its vivid plumage in shades of orange, yellow, lime green and pink, it's a source of luxury quills and its song can cause [madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxNMfsAC33s) if you listen for too long (WARNING: LINK CONTAINS TWO HOURS OF *ACTUAL* FWOOPER SONG. PROCEED WITH CAUTION)

Meanwhile, the diricawl is native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean (not far from Madagascar), was well known to muggles, and is able to teleport in a puff of feathers (much like a phoenix). Muggles believed they had hunted it to extinction, whereas in reality it just learned to avoid them, and nobody dared correct them that their ""dodo bird"" yet lives, because allowing them to think it's extinct at their hands seems to have raised their awareness about how it's bad to indiscriminately kill creatures and drive them to extinction.

3955,ancs18,1557100948,"I wanted to gauge people's thoughts on the prophecy.  


If Voldemort had never heard it (or even heard of it), he wouldn't have detoured from his original plan of domination to attack Harry and his parent – and we all know how that went. His following, influence and power would've continued to increase and he would've been incredibly hard to defeat, if able to at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the same fate happened upon him – he was beaten (without making a Harry-horcrux) and slowly returned to power. Had he not heard the prophecy, he wouldn't have been obsessed with Harry – he didn't need Harry's blood to return (any magic blood would do so a follower would've sufficed) – and he would've returned a lot earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

But let's say everything DID happen all the way up to GoF – if he didn't give any value to the prophecy then he wouldn't have felt the need to be the one to kill Harry, thus opening it up to anyone to kill him. While Harry being a horcrux might have complicated things – if he didn't have the obsession and just focused on his plans then I can't see how they would've stopped him.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, without Sybill Trelawney, they would've been hard-pressed to defeat the Dark Lord – not because of what she said, but because of how Voldemort reacted to it.  


Way to go Sybill!

3976,SaltFishing9,1557078614,"In tribute to Harry Potter and the Portrait of what looked like a large pile of ash, I've written my own, slightly less organised story using Botnik. It was made during a particularly boring period in my so-called ''life.'' Nevermind though, hope you all got a kick out of it. :)  
Privet Drive was now almost forgotten. The Dursleys had completely lost their last few seconds and were now dead as Mrs. Detention. But Harry was sure that the Dursleys were going to get a compartment of magical herbs in midair. Harry could think of nothing else and was now getting more than he would be allowed to be. It wasn’t his own rage they had reached, and he could stop talking due mainly so he could tell Sirius to look down into an empty glass. Ron was drunkenly thinking about the tale of the castle of sick glass and subjecting angrily. He was rather pleased with a wave of cold and wanted to drive. He got into bed and started trying to find a large road. 

  
""I think I will have to stay out of the country,"" said Ron. ""And then I think I’ll go to king’s cross."" 

  
The bed car turned right at the door and turned toward the lake. ron’s few students ran up the stone street to his left and fell asleep, looking relieved that something was going to happen to him. Ron was high as a pair of pinstriped dumbledore hats. He invented Mr Pygmy and then fell asleep almost at once. in his dream, Harry yelled at the end of the moon. The wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of him and using floo powder, which was missing several cries of delight, pensively asked what was going on in the morning. Harry looked at him in surprise and Ron went to sit down on the balls of light on the edge of the forbidden common room. Ron began sinking into a kind of horrified yet determined Dudley and looked around. The truth was that Ron considered his relationship with his wand to be rather red. Dumbledore corrected him firmly over a piece of toast. Harry was on a bus at the end of the field. The drunkest of the men was still trying desperately to be rather pleased with the ministry of green robes. It was not an effort to be seen. Harry could not see what was so angry. It could just run the other champions. It did the first week. Ron could see the vast box of crystallized pineapple. She was holding a copy of the daily Hagrid and clearly thought that Harry had been afraid of a dustbin. 

  
""I know what you want me to do. "" Said Ron in a highly ungrateful sounding thunderstruck Ron way. ''You want to Curse the prime minister’s nose until he is ready to tell you what you want. But I must not be stupid. I’m restricted to you, and I’m not going to do it. But I must say, you know what aunt Bathilda's lord will be.''   
Ron was now wholeheartedly and hopelessly mad. A few stray professional truths sharply strolled off around the edge of the sofa, which Ron lived on. It was a very long and huge sofa, and it was almost as big as the hundreds of students in Hogwarts school. He could have lived in the corner of it all his life. Harry was awake in the middle of a dustbin. He could see where Ron was lying and he could not help feeling rather frightened. He appeared beside him on his mind and went in it. Harry and Ron together at the end of the field of magic inside the tent of aeroplane drunkenly watched television, wands like swords and Hermione grimly saying something to goblins. She was holding court and didn't know what was going on since she had decided to continue with a wave of cold stone. Harry bellowed toward the lawn of panic in their usual twelve Christmas seats. ron’s imitation of wormtail’s impossible meat air was suddenly full of jangling metal. voldemort had fallen out of bed and started sorting the robes into two thousand magical games. He had never been able to snatch a few seconds to himself. He decided to go back to bed and sank into the great black cloak around the room. His dream, however, was looking rather mundungus. Harry told Ron as quietly as possible...   
""don’t you know how much I want your essay on the train you don’t go on to get to the stone? I think we ought to be in my head. ""

  
""But Harry. "" Said Ron in a low and indignant voice. ""What about your singing armadillo? It’s just going on about how bad dobby is. ""  
Harry could not bear to discuss his theory. He was rather frightened. Ron had started to rain and Hermione looked as though she was addressing the other pavement. It was crucial that he told them all about twenty quidditch teams, but before he could do so, the pink pot of green eyes fell upon their heads. Everything was now wholeheartedly screwed.   
Then, Ron woke up and saw that he was still in his bed in the middle of the oncoming crowd in the land of the great black eyebrows. At this point, Harry woke up and throwing down his fat wand at the floor above him, he realized that he should not have accepted every flavour beans. Especially not the mutilated Bulgarian in a small cardboard box ones.   
Harry looked up at the towering Hermione and knew that he had become an owl. Unfortunately, however, he had been hoping to be a giant hourglass at the end of the holidays.   ""Voldemort has no bin. ""  gasped Harry with a bewildered writhing as Ron opened his own wand and jet shop.  ''maybe I can tell the ministry of magical filthy half inches. but I better go to bed again. I’ve got a clue going on and I don’t want to go to the minister of muggles.''   
He couldn’t harry. He had been expelled from his face with a feeling of mingled fury. It was now almost over, and then Hermione raised her wand and said in a feeble sort of voice: ""Avada your mum!"" Blue slimy air streamed out of Harry’s soul through his scar. Depression. It was his last escape, Harry went to bed with the air and fell asleep wincing as pain shot out of his hand. Harry could see in the middle of his head and his face was suddenly demented. Harry had grown so old. It was very much more than Professor McGonagall had come to investigate. Ron looked at his watch and then laughed and cast him a clap on the balls. They were soon going to be fed. Harry could hardly wait.

4015,Sciencejet,1557023057,"So, I'm doing some research in preparation of writing my Wizarding World fan-fiction titled ""Thirteen Uses of Dragon's Blood"" (In-universe only, does not cross with Potter Saga or Fantastic Beasts Saga in any way. End of shameless plug) I've come across a block with understanding the mechanics of Wordless Magic/Non-verbal spells.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read all of the books (including \*shudder\* *Cursed Child*) and from what I understand there are two methods of using wordless magic:

1. Saying the incantation of a spell in your mind.
2. Thinking really hard about what you want to happen.

I'll explain both as best as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason One: Saying the incantation of a spell in your mind.

This one is pretty self-explanatory, but the problem is that we only really see this method being explicitly used twice in all the books, and only one time it was successful. Both times this method was used explicitly was in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.* In Chapter 12, ""Silvers and Opals"" Harry accidentally used *Levicorpus* on Ron in the dormitory. In the books, it explicitly states that Harry thought the incantation in his mind, and then Ron went up in the air. If I recall correctly, this scene is the only time that this method for casting is explicitly stated as being used, and is successful. The only other time that this method is explicitly stated as being used was in Chapter 8, ""Snape Victorious"" where Harry was under the Full-Body Lock Curse (cast by Malfoy) on the Hogwarts Express and he tried to summon his wand to undo the curse by thinking ""Accio Wand"" over and over again. If you guys remember, it didn't work and he had to be saved by Nymphadora Tonks. Granted, it probably failed because he was attempting to perform wordless AND wandless magic at the same time. But these two scenes were the only places that explicitly stated that this method of ""thinking incantation to cast"" was how you cast wordless magic in all seven books + spinoffs + mistakes-that-should-never-have-happened.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason Two: Thinking really hard about what you want to happen.

This method is found, literally, everywhere else. The books are riddled with all sorts of examples of wordless magic being performed. In *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,* Professor Dumbledore changed the house banners from Slytherin to Gryffindor without saying a word. In *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:* Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Mr. Weasley conjured armchairs out of thin air without so much as a whisper. Mrs. Weasley uses a whole bunch of wordless magic to cook food for everyone. The spells included automatic knives, sauce summoning, and more.  However, we are never actually clued into the incantation that would allow a wizard to perform these spells; this leads me to the conclusion that there simply wasn't any incantation to be shared. In my headcanon, at some point in a wizard's lifetime he/she learned that they didn't need any incantations to use magic, they just needed to visualize very clearly what they wanted to happen to cast the spell. I have a major piece of evidence (or mental-gymnastics if you would prefer) that support this method being the primary way to cast non-verbal magic.

1. If this method wasn't the case, there would be waaaaaaaayyy too many incantations to memorize for the simplest procedures. Think about it, in the books we see a lot of magic being performed by a lot of people. If each of those spells had to have an incantation attached to it, there is no freaking way that a Hogwarts student would be able to memorize them all. Even limiting the spell selection to what the student would most likely use in their everyday lives would still mean memorizing hundreds upon hundreds of incantations, wand-movements, etc. It's silly to expect for even Hermione to be able to memorize it all. Don't believe me? Check the Harry Potter wiki page on spells, there are literally hundreds of spells to memorize. I don't believe that any student at Hogwarts would be able to practice and memorize all the spells on that page, not to mention the probably thousands that exist in the universe that wasn't written down in the books.

If this is indeed the case, it would fix the one major gripe that I've had with non-verbal magic since forever. In the books, it's clearly stated that there is only one advantage to using non-verbal magic and it only applies within duels. That is that non-verbal magic gives you a split-second advantage since the opponent doesn't know what to expect for your magic to do. HOWEVER, there are three major disadvantages to using non-verbal magic: which is that it requires more concentration than regular magic, the effects are less powerful, and the effects are less precise. With these three major disadvantages, why is it that non-verbal magic is the most common method of magic casting among trained wizards? Surely you would like to cast in the easiest method possible and make sure that your spells are accurate and stronger. The only explanation would be that there is simply no way to cast those spells since they don't have incantations but instead came from the mind of the castor himself. It would also explain why Hogwarts would push fifth-year students to learn non-verbal magic and making it expected for all their classes. In a training environment like Hogwarts where magic is not guaranteed to work, one would think that the teachers would like to minimize the threat of a spell going off the rails because a student wasn't concentrating enough to perform it correctly, surely adding the non-verbal element would be a recipe for disaster. It would really only be required in Defense Against the Dark Arts where there really is a use for it. The only explanation here would be that Hogwarts professors know that this method of non-verbal magic is how students would perform the spells that they need in the real world like 99% so they deem the risk tolerable enough to teach them this specific skill.

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I have so far, which is why I decided to bring it up to the Harry Potter fanbase before I start writing to see what you guys can come up with. Do you think I'm right, do you think that I'm wrong, how else can you explain the mechanics of nonverbal magic in the Wizarding World? I look forward to seeing your answers.

4017,HottskullxD,1557021120,"Or if Lucius hadn't entered Madam Malkin's and Hagrid had stayed away a bit longer...Would Draco have made a better impression on Harry?? 🤔🤔 Yes, little Malfoy is pompous and a bit full of himself when they have their very first encounter, but from both the book and the movie, Dray seemed really excited to get a potential new friend. You could tell he was extremely disappointed when Harry turned down his friendship due to the bad blood between the Weasley's ***and*** Draco's own crude and rude behavior. 

...It's **not** an excuse for his terrible behavior, but he was hurt by Harry and acted as the spoiled child they are - with an inferiority complex who was used to getting whatever they wanted (~~add to the fact that Draco is so desperately trying to be the ""perfect"" Malfoy/son and has daddy issues just as deep and vast as the Black Lake) it's a wonder he himself lasted as long as he did without becoming a DE...~~ And yes, I am one of those who ***firmly*** believes that he was under duress and only took on the mark to stay close to his mother, who I'm pretty sure **wasn't** a Death Eater.)
So after finding out that the boy he was talking to turned out to be *the* ***Harry Potter***, I'm sure that crushed his Pureblood pride even more. Not being liked by someone Draco probably looked up to definitely didn't help his feelings for the Golden Trio as the years past. Plus we know Lucius is _whispering _ *yelling* in his sons ear about all that blood purity bigotry. After all hate is taught. 

Remembering the first book, Ron instigates a lot of their fights/squabbles...and the Weasley's are just as guilty here for letting all that bad blood dictate whom they speak to...

So, naturally there are three Unforgivables, the Imperius, the Cruciatus and Avada Kedavra which are horrible, horrifying, repugnant etc. First of all, Avada Kedavra is absolutely an unforgivable, but I'm leaning more towards an ethical/moral question discussion or opinions. But (and this is something I always wondered) the Avada Kedavra is horrifying because it is (instant) murder. The instant part of is what has made me wonder lately if it can be classified solely as an unforgivable? 

What if somebody would have an incurable disease (not even magic could fix) that would see them wasting away until death, would a painless death would be considered a possible option? Or looking at it from another perspective, there are other curses through which, in the HP universe, death can happen and arguably more torturous, painful and slow depending on the use (e.g. Sectumsempra, Fiendfyre, Expulso, Reducto etc.). I read a fan fiction that made it so that the Avada Kedavra was so devastating and horrible because, not only was it used as murdered, it also effectively murdered the person’s soul, although I believe it’s non-canon. (Although I wonder if the echoes produced during GoF with Priori Incantatem are their souls or..?).

I believe if you took Moody or Kingsley and threw them back to 1000 A.D., they would defeat any of the Hogwarts founders in a duel, perhaps 2 at once too, even though they were considered as 4 of the greatest of their day. 

Now, maybe the biggest argument against my theory is that witches and wizards just don’t develop the same way as humans, but I’m calling rubbish on this as well.

Magizoologists have been trying to understand how some of the wizarding worlds magical creatures came to be. Tell us about a magical creature you've studied, and explain how they evolved one (or more!) of their magical properties. 

# How It Works

Identify a magical creature and what magical property (or properties) it has. This can be a magical creature already identified in the series, or one of your own discovery! Explain how this magical property may have evolved, and/or how it benefits the creature in the wild. You can explore the creatures history and how it has evolved into its modern form. Or you can just focus on how its magical ability helps it thrive today.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Written - write about the creature and its properties, and explain how its magical abilities help it survive in the wild. 

Option 2: Visual - draw a picture of the creature showing how it uses its powers (can be accompanied by a short description to explain what's going on in the picture)

And on some level I definitely don’t hate it (more akin to the kick i got out of “My Immortal” than to my love of Harry Potter).

I’m sure it’s been said before, but it has some of the best elements of a bad fanfiction by a technically competent writer ~~who has read the first book and maybe seen the movies~~. I’m not going to pay $179 to see it on Broadway, but I’m not mad I read it.

4083,BigTimeDogs,1556906380,"I know that you're thinking ""Wait...isn't that the house of the Golden Trio, and just about every main character we are introduced to in the books?"" The thing is, though, Gryffindor actually seems to be more underrated in real life when compared to other houses.

For example, whenever people are asked what their house is, you will mostly hear Slytherin, cause they got a bad rap and there's more to them than just evil. They are also cunning and ambitious. Or Hufflepuff, cause they're more than just the 'nice' house. I actually hear more about Hufflepuff now than years ago, when it was the house noone wanted to be in. Ravenclaw has people, but to a lesser extent when compared with the more vocal Hufflepuffs and Slytherins. (Ravenclaws are also underrated, but that's an entirely different story).

Gryffindor, on the other hand, is a house noone seems to want to be in anymore-- at least, from what I see nowadays. Whenever people think of Gryffindor, they think ""Oh, you're just a Gryffindor because Harry, Ron, and Hermione were there."" It's like being a Gryffindor is forbidden, because when people think Gryffindor they think 'brave', when there's more to it. Gryffindor is also valiant, chivalrous, and practical. 

Overall, it seems to fall into the ""it's so popular, it's uncool to be in there"" mentality these days, and it's a downright shame if you ask me.",harrypotter,Gryffindor is actually an underrated house,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bkbftt/gryffindor_is_actually_an_underrated_house/,1556877580.0

Harry just jumped under his cloak, everything around him is chaos and he hears Hagrid shouting his name. “Harry! Harry! Where’s Harry?”

A few thoughts on that. 
Hagrid thinks Harry is dead. He saw him die. He is SURE Harry is dead. Never has anyone came back from Avada Kedavara. 
Around Hagrid the Battle breaks loose again. The fight for the only home he had for the last 50+ years. He had every right just to throw himself into battle and crushing those Death eater sculls. 
But his first concern is Harry. Less. Harrys corpse. He loves him so much that even on a battlefield he cannot stand the thought of Harrys body getting damaged any more.

4105,MRSA_nary,1556875483,"When I was first reading this, I remember thinking that Harry decided he liked Sirius incredibly fast. A probably loving home (although you just met him so nobody knows) with an emotionally unstable man who can't necessarily feed you all the time seems like a bad idea to me. I wondered why Harry didn't ask more questions, like ""how do you have anywhere to live when you've been in prison for years?"" or ""you probably have a few things to figure out first, the emotional toll from living in Azkaban is gonna be a bitch to deal with"" or ""Hey, I just met you. And this is crazy. Let's start with writing. I'll send Hedwig daily.""

&amp;#x200B;

On this re-read, I have a few more thoughts.

1. Harry admires his parents, almost to the point of worship. His dad was friends with Sirius, so he must be AWESOME! He doesn't think at all about how Sirius may not be the same person his dad hung out with in high school anymore. He spent a decade having all his happiness sucked out of him, he might have changed a bit since then. 
2. Harry's behavior isn't that far off from people who experience long-lasting abuse growing up. I know we talk about difficulty trusting others when you've had a childhood like Harry's, but for some it's sort of the opposite. Rather than a constant difficulty trusting, the problem is not regulating trust, which is why boundaries are such a huge issue for a lot of these kids. It's more like ""oh, you like me and actually give me any attention and treat me like a human child? Can you be my new parent? I WANT YOU IN MY LIFE ALL THE TIME FOREVER AND EVER!!"" This also opens kids up to exploitation from truly evil people who know how this mindset works. Harry literally meets innocent Sirius and then asks ""Have you got a house? When can I move in?"" , all within hours. Harry lives a happy life now because of school, but his background is one of chronic abuse and neglect, and that stuff doesn't go away as soon as the Hogwarts letter arrives.

Other possibilities-

1. Harry is an immature teenager and doesn't think about things like ""I need food and shelter. Sirius might not have that"". 
2. JKR knows Sirius is a good guy and wrote him like that before she made me personally feel that the situation was good enough.

4115,MetalVenomLudens,1556865562," Crimes of Grindelwald suffers from a myriad of issues that could be solved by editing in some finer details and scenes to make the plot much more cohesive and give characters like Credence who are central to the story an actual presence in the plot and pace it much better.

My cut of the movie aims to do just that. Credence is given the focus he deserves, entire scenes have been recut and restructured and new footage from Behind The Scenes and Deleted Scenes has been reinserted into the movie to make it flow much better and make sense.

If you've already seen the original movie many times, you will notice that a lot of the scenes in my version have been restructured by taking them out of context to construct entirely new scenes. Some footage from the first Fantastic Beasts like dialogue has been reused to make character decisions make sense.

A brief summary of changes :

1. CREDENCE IS NOW CENTRAL TO THE PLOT INSTEAD OF BEING RELEGATED TO A MERE PLOT DEVICE.
2. QUEENIE IS CALLED OUT FOR BASICALLY ""DATE RAPING"" JACOB AND A GLIMPSE OF THE PARIS GARDEN SCENE HAS BEEN ADDED TO MAKE QUEENIE'S DECISION TO DEFECT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE.
3. THE ROMANTIC THRILLER TAG IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN MY CUT AND IS EMPHASIZED FREQUENTLY.
4. MOST DELETED SCENES HAVE BEEN ADDED BACK IN A WAY THAT FEELS TRULY NATURAL.
5. THERE IS ALSO A BUNCH OF NEW FOOTAGE ALONG WITH THE DELETED SCENES.
6. EXPOSITION DUMPS HAVE BEEN FULLY MINIMIZED.
7. A MID-CREDIT SCENE HAS BEEN ADDED THAT WILL SHOCK YOU GUYS.

A couple glitches are present in this cut but nothing too major, stuff like an establishing shot reading ""Paris, France"" because I needed an establishing shot and didn't have any.

My small change would have been that instead of Ron winning the cup for Gryffindor after they had been horrible all year.. He instead won the Quidditch cup for Hufflepuff.

My reasoning being.. 

Rons already played well for a change. Him helping Gryffindor win a game, turning the Weasley is our king song on its head, taking the cup from Slytherin is almost enough imo. Gryffindor played horribly for 2 games out of 3 so it felt like JK just made them win because well its either them of Slytherin. 

Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw, hardly get any exposure in the books. The house cup and Quidditch cup just seem to pass between Gryffindor and Slytherin.. and imo its a bit of author laziness on JK's part. She doesn't give us the numbers but she does mention that Hufflepuff actually defeated Slytherin themselves that season so it would have been nice to see Ron take the cup away from Slytherins who had been berating him all season with Weasley is our king and becoming and almost defacto hero of another house. This would have had a funny roll on effect to the next year where Ron wasn't just Harry Potters mate.. instead you could have seen moments where Hufflepuffs would react friendlier to him than Harry

Gryffindor, as I’m sure you can gather, was *supposed* to make [Ravenclaw’s menu](https://imgur.com/a/ku1Rhro), but never submitted anything. Awkward. 

To reiterate, here are the results from Part 1 of the Chopped Challenge:

* Ravenclaw came in first place with their Flourish and Blotts menu, earning 125 points.

* Hufflepuff placed second with their Gringotts menu; **however**, as they turned in their menu late, they will be receiving only 75 points.

* Gryffindor placed third with their Prefects’ Bathroom menu (my favorite theme, but that may be because I came up with it), but gets no points because we made the challenge.

* Slytherin came in fourth place with their Grimmauld Place menu, earning 75 points. 


**Part 2** was operated as follows: Each House was assigned a menu purely by RNG, *before* we got in the menus. Voting was *extremely* difficult and *very, very* close between the 3 submissions; everyone did a FANTASTIC job! I cannot stress that enough. Since everyone did so great, it came down to presentation. 

* Because we felt they went the farthest with their intricate presentation, Slytherin came in first place, earning 125 points. Congratulations, Slytherin!

* Because they made a themed (but fairly basic) website, Hufflepuff came second, earning 100 points.

* Having the most basic presentation (just an imgur album), Ravenclaw came in third place, earning 75 points.


**That brings our totals to:**

* Hufflepuff: 175 points

* Ravenclaw: 200 points

* Slytherin: 200 points

As I’m sure you can see, that ties Ravenclaw and Slytherin. HOWEVER, I’m going to pull a Dumbledore because I *am* Gryffindor Head of House, after all.

/u/Macallion of Ravenclaw actually went out and caught ants to make Slytherin’s Ant Ice Cream dessert. I was astounded by this. Therefore, I am awarding Ravenclaw **15 more points** for her effort. If you can’t figure out the math, that puts **Ravenclaw** at **215 points**.

Since then, I've thought, since the seventh years at Hogwarts are about to graduate and pursue their lives in the real Wizarding world, it might be interesting for them to have a field trip to Azkaban. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. Since dementors are obviously swarming Azkaban, it would be crazy for the seventh years to be in their presence. So maybe while they're there on the field trip, the dementors can leave Azkaban briefly while under the control of the Ministry and Aurors can be used to guard the prisoners while the seventh years are there. Seventh years can then be shown the prison and can speak with some of the prisoners there. While speaking with them, it'll help ingrain in their heads just how badly their life will change when they commit a crime. It would be an important message to give the seventh years in having them be on the right path in their lives upon graduating Hogwarts, similar to the message my class got when we took our own prison field trip.",harrypotter,I've thought for a while that it might have been interesting if the seventh years took a field trip to Azkaban,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bjxz65/ive_thought_for_a_while_that_it_might_have_been/,1556790972.0

4185,ykickamoocow111,1556798222,"I thought this would be an interesting question. We discuss the HP characters a lot but one of the great things about JKR's writing is that characters mostly feel like real people, with positives and negatives and many layers to their personalities.

However, in saying that it happens quite often that smaller personality traits are often forgotten or not discussed. For instance, we know Hermione loves books, that is a key characteristic of hers that we all know, but are there any traits Hermione has shown over the course of the books that are not widely discussed or known?

An example I have is with Luna. Everyone thinks of her as a bit airy, and someone that is very open minded and things like that, and she is for the most part, but Luna has a trait in her personality where she does not like people questioning her beliefs. This is one example

&gt;“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.

&gt;“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer,

&gt;“The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.”

&gt;“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy
quality. “My father’s the editor.”

&gt;“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got
some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .”

&gt;“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fiftyseven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it

I mean this is not the greatest example, but it shows Luna is capable of anger, and I do recall other instances where she gets angry or annoyed when someone suggests her beliefs might not be real. It isn't something that happens much, probably only a few times in the entire of the last 3 books, but it is a characteristic of hers, one not often discussed.

Here is an example of Hermione's more light hearted side we almost never see and is not widely discussed

&gt;The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the
easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out
into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able
to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.

&gt;“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”

&gt;“Don’t,” Harry advised her.

I mean can you imagine Hermione doing a little jig? I mean she did one, and it is almost hard to imagine, but it shows that being silly is part of Hermione, a part she tries to hide.

Another example

&gt;“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself together.

&gt;“Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll
take some Felix and have another go this evening.”

&gt;“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet
and performing a graceful pirouette. “Destination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .” she murmured.

&gt;“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is —
quick, hide me!”

&gt;“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as another couple
of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.

Missed it?

&gt;“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet
and performing a graceful pirouette

Can anyone imagine Hermione doing a graceful pirouette? I mean it just doesn't seem like a Hermione thing to do, but it is another example of her being silly, or just having fun that I think we as fans often forget.

You see, im a very uncultured teenager on senior year. I have a bucket list. Things I want to be able to see, read, watch, before I die. Ive always been addicted to spoiling myself and reading lore on wikipedia and random pages instead of enjoying things myself wholly. Watch a lot of clips on youtube. Reviews, video essays on writing, film analysis, drama topics (TheGamerFromMars, Spill..etc.)  Actually read just a few book series. The Hunger Games, Twilight, Lord of The Rings, The Hobbit. Unfinished with Eragon. Few Nancy Drew books, How To Train Your Dragon..Best of Archie Comics Book Compilation.. Finished about 22 anime. Lots of unfinished anime series on a list. I say I like lovecraft and the dark souls aesthetic to frendos..But really ive never read any of his works nor played the games. Like I do enjoy the feel..the idea of something like this. A thing. I collect a lot of art, and daydream about a certain aesthetic. By now I know how truly empty I feel. I used to write poems. Short stories but unfinished... My best friend has never had a laptop until grade 11...and im glad she finds satisfaction in simply watching so many anime, reading the latest post on fb and chatting people. But I don't. Thats probably why our personalities clash sometimes. I say Im a gamer but really my old pc was slow...and I couldnt get into minecraft much. I loved re4 and ff12 when I was a kid, played with my grandpa. Got addicted to Terraria. AQW, Little Big Planet, Crypt of the Necrodancer..only a few games ive truly played and finished, most just watching youtube gamers. Its weird how picky I am, wanting to read reviews first. Theres always passion in me wanting to find more of something thats interesting..but never really satisfying myself and enjoying something as it is, no analysis or criticism.

Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand-tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.


""Thank you very much, Professor.""


""You’re a good boy,"" said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus moustache. ""**And you’ve got her eyes**... just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it ...""

A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grab on Harry’s robes slackened.

They then overhear another group of outlaws, one of which was Tonks' dad, Ted Tonks. Harry hears Ted say ""accio salmon"" and then hears the sound of dozens of salmon jumping out of the river and next to Ted &amp; Co.

So ... why the fuck didn't just do that to get some edible food? I mean ... it's one thing if the readers can themselves think of an instant, easy solution to the characters' problems (e.g. why didn't the Fellowship just have the eagles fly the ring over to Mordor in a few hours?). It's another thing entirely for the *author herself* to actually demonstrate a quick and easy solution to a problem, and then the heroes just never use it.

It's not even like that time in Order of the Phoenix where Cho asked Harry on a date at the upcoming Hogsmeade visit, only for Harry to not realize until a moment later what was actually happening. In that book ... 

&gt;!“Erm . . . there’s another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice?”
“What? Oh no, I haven’t checked the notice board since I got back. . . .”
“Yes, it’s on Valentine’s Day. . . .”
“Right,” said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this.
“Well, I suppose you want to — ?”
“Only if you do,” she said eagerly.
Harry stared. He had been about to say “I suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meeting is?” but her response did not seem to fit.
“I — er —” he said.
“Oh, it’s okay if you don’t,” she said, looking mortified. “Don’t worry. I-I’ll see you around.”
She walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working frantically. Then something clunked into place.

He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.
“Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine’s Day?”

Then throughout the series he was undergoing even more suffering because his soul was slowly being destroyed, one piece at a time, and then ultimately dies in DH.

I am fairly decent to most people and usually try to help out when I can. I do enjoy a nice snack every now and again, and the Hufflepuffs location near the kitchens seems most idyllic!

I guess in accordance with the earth element I have kind of a thing for plants and animals. 

I like house Gryffindor and Harry himself but I think many  Gryffindors as whole have qualities I don’t condone. The tendency to fly off the handle or jump to conclusions/ actions is something I don’t hold much credit with. I always try to calmly step back and assess situations ( I’ve been told how calm/ level headed/ in control I am.)

I guess I don’t like presence, arrogance that much. I like to not tread on people’s feelings too much ( for the sake of peace if nothing else) but would say what I think of it were important.

Idk I feel little resonance with that other houses except Gryffindor and find them a bit too hot blooded, quick to leap for me. Am I a Hufflepuff?

1) The Dementor sucks out both souls and so destroys the Horcrux?

2) The Dementor only takes Harry's soul and so the Horcrux ends up possessing his body?

3) The Dementor only takes the Horcrux, destroying it and leaving Harry Horcrux free?

I'm leaning towards both souls being destroyed, but what's everyone's thoughts? Or alternatively, do people think that the Dementor wouldn't be enough to destroy the Horcrux and would somehow become a Horcrux itself?

#Magical Interference in Muggle History

On the (thankfully) infrequent occasions when the magical and muggle world dramatically intermingle, the Ministry works hard to conceal the truth from the muggles. Branches such as the Obliviators, the Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee, and the Office of Misinformation ensure that the truth about the existence of the Wizarding World doesn’t spread. 

In recent years, the departments responsible for maintaining secrecy have noticed a dip in the number of applications they receive. They suspect that young witches and wizards are unaware of just how much work these departments have done over the years. In order to rectify the situation, a multi-department team is working on publishing a guidebook to some of the more interesting incidents they’ve been involved with over the years. However, their publication deadline has been moved up, and they’re struggling to finish their document in time! That’s why they’ve asked for our help.

To assist the Ministry’s team, please compile a description of any famous event in Muggle history that was actually related to the Wizarding Community. In your descriptions, the team has asked that you endeavor to include any of the following pertinent information:

- Where and when did the incident occur
- How do muggles refer to the event (e.g. Black Tuesday, The Shot Heard Round the World, etc.)
- What was the involvement of the magical community
- How did the Ministry respond to the incident, and how did they cover it up
- How successful was their attempted coverup, in terms of muggles believing the excuse provided
- Any consequences for the wizards involved
- Any changes in the muggle or wizarding communities that occurred as a result of the incident


^(Note from Hermy: events can be real or imagined. If you can dream it, you can do it!)

&amp;nbsp;

##The deadline for submissions is ***11:59pm ET on Sunday, May 26.*** Feel free to submit your responses in written, visual, video, musical, or other format as you see fit.

Now that's out of the way. Honestly, I just find them stupid... that's it, but this is why I find them stupid. There are only 4 houses, why are you mix matching them? Although I do understand why someone may align themselves with a hybrid house because you don't fit into one of the 4 houses perfectly, well guess what... no one does. We're human after all and nobody will most likely only fit into one house only. So how about instead of aligning yourself with a hybrid house truly look at yourself and you'll find what house you belong in. You may call yourself a Gryfinpuff or whatever but what do you value above all else, there is where you'll find the answer. So how about commit to a Hogwarts house or just do the Pottermore quiz and there you go. Because if you were really at Hogwarts the sorting hat isn't going to yell Slytherpuff and no one is going to make a common room just for you.

4260,TheKingsPeace,1556683888,"Here is my two cents on James vs. Snape feud that has so divided the fandom so bitterly.

Here’s my take: neither of them were that great of kids.

I️ completely accept that James was pretty arrogant and perhaps willfully cruel as well. A lot of kids are arrogant especially if they have literally everything going for them ( grades, popularity, athletic talent, etc). James was not unique in that way.

I️ believe James had a good heart in some ways and for sure would stick his neck out for his friends, but he was not generally good or kind to the world. Very different from his son Harry in that regard 

Much of Snapes hatred toward James was likely not bullying as much as envy. He wanted pretty much everything James had, couldn’t get it and thus hated him for it ( in my opinion.)

It’s also important to point out that Snape was not a sweet lamb of a kid either. Similar to James he wasn’t out to help the poor, walk little old ladies across the street or really make the world a better place.

Yes Snape was disadvanged in many ways but he also was even as a child somewhat bitter, spiteful and envious of a person.

I️ just think people are complicated is all.",harrypotter,My 2 cents on James vs. Snape,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bjczla/my_2_cents_on_james_vs_snape/,1556655088.0
4262,chelisakoruna,1556677480,"I love the original story, and I'm kind of a snob about source material with the books - but the movie always makes me feel super disappointed as the end of such an epic story. Here's a few thoughts I collected as to why I feel so let down: 

1. Characters just don't act like themselves. A prime example of this happens when Harry’s body is brought back to the grounds of Hogwarts for everyone to see. First of all, nobody looks appropriately horrified. Harry Potter just died, for frick's sake. Neville’s speech afterwards is so copy-and-paste Hollywood it hurts. I get the general message: he’s trying to rally the good guys after a devastating blow, but it's done really cheesily in my opinion. (Not to mention that in the books it's Ron who makes a comment that the resistance against Voldemort is still gonna fight, and Ron's my fave so it sucks they took that away from him, but whatever.)
Speaking of Ron, the writers totally try to make a reversal of Ron and Hermione's roles after their kiss scene, which turns Hermione into a weak sappy lovestruck character instead of the fierce Hermione we love from the books who fights and is a total boss until the very end. 

2. Voldemort's death literally goes down the OPPOSITE of how it does in the book, which I know has probably been pretty thoroughly picked apart by critics already, but I gotta say it. Also, Harry's treatment of the Elder Wand is so much less graceful in the books (...you're just gonna break a wand that carries centuries of wizard tradition and extremely powerful magic ok ok we're just doin whatever now!) 

3. Awesome, beloved characters gettin their storylines/deaths glossed the heck over like Lupin and Tonks. We don't get to see Percy reunite with the Weasleys. The entire Gray Lady's story is less impactful because it doesn't tell us about her heavy drama with the Bloody Baron, IMO. 


It helps the movie's case that Alan Rickman’s hair and makeup is fire.

I don’t feel like there’s anyway I’m a Gryffindor. My boyfriend is a Gryffindor, and he fits it to a T. I told him he was a Gryffindor before he even took the quiz, and I was right. He’s a freaking Leo for crying out loud lol.

4288,acerthorn,1556652031,"The prequel and spin-off movies like Crimes of Grindlewald and Fantastic Beasts are currently doing rather mediocre at the box office, and it's not too hard to see why. First of all, many of these are prequels, and prequels are really, really had to do correctly (case in point, the Star Wars prequels). That would require an entire 5,000 word essay to explain in detail, so for the sake of this thread, just take my word for it that prequels are hard to do. Google it if you must.

Meanwhile, other movies that aren't prequels, but rather are spinoffs, lack the J.K. Rowling touch that made the original series what they were. Sure, Rowling may offer advice and recommend certain creative changes, but in many ways, it was the little things that made the biggest difference. The little quirks in Rowling's writing style, many of which Rowling herself probably didn't even fully realize, while small on their own, added up quickly.

Case in point: In the first chapter of the first book, the narrator explains that baby Dudley had learned a new word, followed in parentheses by the word ""won't."" The implication, here, is that the word ""won't"" is the new word that Dudley learned that day, clearly showing that Dudley was going to grow up to be a spoiled brat.

It's such a small quirk in the writing style, but repeat that quirky style about five hundred thousand times across seven novels, and the entire franchise slowly starts to build up its own style and format that can't be replicated by any other author. Hell, I doubt even Rowling herself is consciously aware of what her own ""writing quirks"" are (""consciously"" being the key word).

Well, what if Rowling herself were to continue the series with regular short stories of Harry's adventures as an auror? This would be a sequel, not a prequel, so it wouldn't fall into the common pitfalls that prequels fall into. The nature of Harry's career naturally lends itself to exciting plots and action, and there's still plenty of ways for Harry's character to develop. Imagine if Harry is forced to gain a reluctant *respect* for the dark arts because he is forced to use them in a limited extent to catch dark wizadrs, in much the same way that cyber-police in the real world are forced to use hacking and viruses to catch malicious hackers and virus programmers.

James was rendered impotent in his 4th year when he was trying to access the passage under the Whomping Willow. He forgot to press the knot that immobilize the tree  and took a HUGE branch to the groin. Because of this, Harry was actually conceived by Lily and a house elf named Foggy.

Foggy was the Potter's house-elf and was given to James and Lily as a wedding gift. Anyways, house-elves can make their own version of polyjuice potion, and that's exactly what James and Lily had him do. Lily vigorously rode Foggy transformed as James (although she wouldn't kiss him on the mouth), until his seed was spilled and planted deep. That's why Harry has green eyes (Lily), untidy jet black hair (James), and of course his knobbly knees (Foggy).

Naturally, James and Lily wanted this kept secret so the last command given to Foggy was to disapparate to the Black Lake and to feed himself to the giant squid. After that day, Foggy was never mentioned again. Even their closest friends and family never knew, and when his disappearance was brought up, James and Lily would lie and say they set Foggy free.

It says, ""No matter how powerful you have become, how terrifying you've grown to be, how many followers you gain, you are still just a boy to me. A child. And you will never be anything more.""

What a fucking power move. 

At the same time, I think it communicates a certain amount of respect that Voldemort isn't used to receiving. He receives fear and loyalty born out of that fear, but the respect that Dumbledore gives him by calling him Tom is the respect of an equal or a superior.

4315,Obi-WanJabroni66,1556606283,"Currently reading the series for the first time, and I stumbled upon an interesting line in Goblet of Fire. 

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione venture out past Hogsmeade to meet up with Sirius, they discuss how he’s been surviving while on the run. They each note that he looks very thin, and he tells them while chomping on some chicken “I’ve been living off rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw too much attention to myself”. (pg. 521)

They proceed with their conversation, mostly Sirius filling in the Trio on Barty Crouch’s history, and the chapter concludes with Ron referencing Sirius in this line, “He must really like you Harry... Imagine having to live off rats”. (pg. 534)

This brought me to two points:

1. Sirius is for sure hoping one of those rats he stumbles across is Wormtail. While the chance of running into that specific rat is rather unlikely, there’s always a chance, and you know Sirius is just hoping for it.  I imagine he’s smashing rats like Charlie Kelly, throughout his whole escapade. 

2. Sirius’ love for Harry, and his desire to be a lionhearted guardian, is balanced by Voldemort’s egotistical love of himself, and desire of immortality and omnipotence.  Both of them will do whatever it takes, but more specifically, they both had to live off rats....",harrypotter,Sirius &amp; Voldemort: Mouseketeers,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bj05qy/sirius_voldemort_mouseketeers/,1556577483.0

4323,pinksea976,1556597371,"At the end of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry Ron and Hermione each get a challenge that suits them perfectly. Harry uses his quidditch skills to get them past the keys, Hermione uses her logic to get her and Harry through the potions problem, and Ron uses his strategic thinking to get them all across the chess board. Each of the three succeeds at a task that best represents their innate talent. 

But there are two other challenges that the three face down there. The Troll and the Devil's Snare. Can those tell us anything about the Trio?  I think so. 

By the time Harry, Ron and Hermione come across the troll in this chapter, it is taken care of by Quirrell and they don't have to face it. But if you consider this troll a symbol of their fight from Halloween, you start to see how this challenge highlights each of their roles.

Harry represents leadership and initiative. He is the one that realizes Hermione is in danger from the troll and leads Ron to find it after the feast. 

Hermione represents theory and background knowledge. She is the one who first masters the wingardium leviosa spell and teaches it to Ron.  

Ron represents practical application and strategy. He is the one who figures out how to apply the wingardium leviosa spell within the context of defeating the troll. 

You see this again with the Devil's Snare. Harry leads them to it and jumps first through the trap door. Hermione immediately knows what the Devil's Snare is and it's weakness. Ron figures out how to turn that knowledge into a practical way to get rid of the plant. He suggests fire, and that Hermione use her wand instead of looking for wood to start that fire. 

Really, those three represent the perfect ingredients for success.",harrypotter,"The talents of Harry, Ron, and Hermione",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/biyzxo/the_talents_of_harry_ron_and_hermione/,1556568571.0

4338,Jacob_wallace,1556572861,"So this is either really obvious and I'm just now noticing, or this is gonna sound off the wall. I didnt read this, just my own showerthoughts, but is fiendfyre from/of Hell?  

So JK obviously won't say one way or the other for obvious reasons. However, after thinking on it, it seems rather obvious. 

For one, the name. Fiend, which is associated/synonymous with demons. Demons from Hell. Then we have the effects. Harry mentions the being biting the stuff that the fire burns. And Crabbe is stated to not be able to control it, so the spell does this of its own accord without help from the caster. Perhaps because the fire is summoned straight from the pits of Hell with the fiends/demons still in it. The monsters within are beings often thought of as demonic, like chimera, serpents, and dragons. While dragons are real animals in Potterverse, maybe there's dragon-like beings in Potterverse Hell?  Idk, we never see Potterverse Hell. Ask Bellatrix. 

It's said this spell is powerful dark magic. Why would a fire spell be explicitly dark magic?  Regular fire is a spell a first year can cast. It's nearly impossible to control. Both of these make sense if you consider that it's from Hell. 

Lastly, it can destroy a horcrux. Because the fire burns souls. It's one of two substances in the world that can destroy a horcrux. 

So to recap. It's from Hell because it's named after demons, literally has demons within it, is explicitly stated to be evil, and has the capability to destroy something housing a soul. 

Obviously this will never be confirmed since JK doesn't want to go Constantine. And that's fine. Still an interesting thought.",harrypotter,Fiendfyre = Hellfire?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/biuxhx/fiendfyre_hellfire/,1556544061.0

Assuming Dumbledore thought that Harry would have destroyed all the Horcuxes at that point and would survive the Voldemort's curse because of the blood connection, how did he think Harry would surely defeat Voldemort in a one to one duel?

4343,02474,1556565916,"...and this is assuming the room still works after Fiendfyre.

Before the events of OotP, we have reason to believe that the only people in Hogwarts who truly knew how to work the Room of Requirement were the house elves. Not even Dumbledore seems to know how to use the room, though it's likely he could have figured it out if he'd cared to. Once Dobby tells Harry that the RoR would make a great place to train the DA, the secret is spread to a couple dozen students. Eventually, Malfoy (presumably via Voldemort) learns how to work the room, and by Deathly Hallows, the room is being used as a safehouse/passageway to Hogsmeade, by students who will return the following year. 

So, over the course of 3 years, the room appears to be a relative secret for the castle to something that a large portion of the student body and faculty will have used. The secret of the room will have been out, and once a secret like that gets out, I think it sticks with people. Kids will tell their little siblings and friends and the key to solving the room will live on.

There are theories that Crabbe's Fiendfyre spell destroyed the room's functionality, but I don't believe this is confirmed.

If the room does survive though, it's likely that its use will become prohibited, since it presumably could be used for all kinds of nefarious purposes, and locks out people who are not there for that specific purpose. Use of the room would be suspicious.",harrypotter,The Battle of Hogwarts ruined the Room of Requirement,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bitkcc/the_battle_of_hogwarts_ruined_the_room_of/,1556537116.0

4347,acerthorn,1556561443,"So the entire A-plot in Goblet of Fire seems pretty convoluted at first glance. As Cinemasins once put it, ""So the entire tournament was rigged just to get Harry to touch a portkey? Couldn't they have just made a portkey out of Harry's breakfast waffles or something?""

I have a fan theory that would cause this convoluted plan to make sense: Just like apparition, portkeys also don't work on Hogwarts grounds in 99.99999999999% of cases.

Think about this for a minute: Inanimate objects can be conjured up out of thin air, and those inanimate objects can be transformed into portkeys in mere seconds if the wizard knows what he's doing. We know this because, on not one but two occasions in Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore creates portkeys in minutes. The first is when Harry warns Dumbledore that Nagini had attacked Arthur Weasley. The second was immediately after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, when Dumbledore made a portkey to teleport Harry back to his own office.

Directly into Dumbledore's office! The office was otherwise completely impregnable, as evidenced by the fact that Harry couldn't escape the office during the 30 minutes he was waiting for Dumbledore.

This presents a serious problem. Don't you think all the extensive security measures placed on Hogwarts are kind of redundant and pointless if somebody can just portkey their way directly into Dumbledore's office in a matter of minutes? Voldemort could have just waited until around midnight on some random night, waiting for Dumbledore to be fast asleep, portkey his way to the side of Dumbledore's bed, and perform the killing curse on Dumbledore!

Sure, use of portkeys is heavily regulated by the Ministry. I'd like you to take one guess as to exactly how many fucks Voldemort gives about those damn laws.

The only way this makes any sense is if we accept that, like apparition, portkeys also don't work on Hogwarts grounds ... unless the Headmaster allows them to work.

Even the anti-disapparition jinx that is normally on Hogwarts can be lifted temporarily by the headmaster. We see this in Half-Blood Prince, when Dumbledore temporarily lifts the ban on the Great Hall so 6th and 7th years can take their first apparition lessons.

So maybe the reason Voldemort had to rig the entire tournament was because ... the Triwizard Cup was already supposed to be a portkey. Dumbledore probably turned the cup into a portkey the day of the Third Task. Once it was made into a portkey, however, dark wizards were able to tamper with the conditions of the portkey at will. I can imagine that the prohibitions on portkeys to and from Hogwarts grounds are much more lenient once the portkey is created in the first place.

4349,acerthorn,1556560347,"So a commonly cited plothole about how house elves work in the Potterverse is that, if house elves are freed whenever they are presented with clothes, does that mean that you can't have them do the laundry without freeing them? Doing the laundry is one of the most common things you'd expect a *house* elf to do as part of their jobs! 

However, I have a fan theory that would actually cause this to make sense: House elves can only be freed if the master gives clothes to the house elf *directly.* Leave a basket of laundry nearby and instruct the house elf to take it and do the laundry with it, and that doesn't count.

At the end of Chamber of Secrets, Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby. How he handles this trickery differs from book to film. In the books, he puts one of his slimy socks on top of Tom Riddle's diary and, in a fleeting moment of letting his guard down (and possibly not fully realizing that it was a sock, since it was probably covered in slime to the point of being virtually unrecognizable), Lucius throws the sock over his head without watching where he's throwing it, and Dobby happens to catch it. In the film, he hides the sock inside the pages of the diary, causing Lucius to intentionally hand the book to Dobby not realizing that it contained a sock.

However, regardless of whether you go by the book or the film, the important thing is ... the sock went form Lucius's hands *directly* to Dobby's hands.

Now, some of you might be thinking ... ""Well, in Order of the Phoenix, Hermoine leaves articles of clothing laying around the Gryffindor Common Room, in the hopes that some Hogwart's house elves will pick them up and therefore become freed. The house elves avoid the common room because they don't want to be freed, so clearly, Hermoine's plan would have worked, if anyone but Dobby actually picked them up."" Actually no, I don't think Hermoine's plan would have worked. Think about it: Hermoine isn't even those house elves' master in the first place. She didn't have the *authority* to free those house elves on Dumbledore's behalf, even if the house elves were totally *willing* to accept clothes and be freed! That's why Harry had to trick Lucius into giving a sock to Dobby, rather than just giving his own sock to him!

Rather, the reason the house elves refused to clean the Gryffindor common room is because ... they knew what Hermoine was trying to do. Even if her efforts were ultimately futile, she can still fuck off with them. Remember, in Goblet of Fire, Hermoine told the Hogwarts house elves that they have the right to wages and clothes, and merely suggesting that to them pissed them off to such a degree that they shoe'd her, Harry, and Ron out of the kitchen in disgust. So I'd imagine her not getting the point and continuing to attempt to free the elves (this time, whether they wanted to be freed or not) would only piss them off even more, even if her efforts to free them wouldn't have worked. Her efforts were still offensive to them.

4409,3421431boom,1556477373,"So this is going to be a long thread but I hope some of you might enjoy it, been meaning to write it up for a while but figured it was about time. Last year was my future wife's 30th birthday and I wanted to do something big, she's a massive Harry Potter fan, what follows in the story of how I surprised her for her 30th. With a epic 5 days of Harry Potter themed surprises. For this I had different gifts for her each day, I also wrote several letters in the character of various Harry Potter characters that basically hinted at the next surprise. This took about 6 months to plan and cost a pretty penny but I hope it might give some others some ideas. 

Here goes. 

**Sunday (her birthday).** 

So this was the first day, she woke up, finds a stuffed hedwig on the coffee table with a letter from the ""ministry of magic"" informing her that she has been selected for a special trip into the magical world as part of an experiment and I am the wizard who will be guiding her through this and she must make her way to Edinburgh. Yeah its nerdy, its cringe but ohhh so much fun. There was also a small Harry Potter charms bracelet and each time she opened a letter she got a new charm for it and there where a lot of letters....

So we get to Edinburgh, where I take her to the Elephant room (a cafe with lots of HP connections) where I give her another letter this time from ""Mcgnagall"" that says she has to go for a history lesson. The history lesson was actually a Harry Potter walking tour of Edinburgh. It was really good fun, very good guid, I highly recommend this.

After that we check into our hotel, visit two Harry Potter shops in Edinburgh, we go for dinner... she gets another letter this time from ""Mad-eye Moody"" saying that a powerful dark wizard has broken into the Edinburgh ministry of magic offices to steal some prophecy and unfortunately I am the only Auroa about so must take my muggle with me to go fend of this threat (I might have alluded to me being a pretty big time wizard in the letters). This was so funny because she couldn't work this letter out but it was actually a Harry Potter themed escape room. This was the first time either of us had done an escape room and despite us both being drunk after drinking lots of what was called ""butter beer"" but I think was actually just...beer, we managed to escape the room. She said this was her favourite part of the trip

AND ITS ONLY DAY ONE....

**Sunday.** 

So Sunday morning we get up, she has no idea what's happening next, and wouldn't you know it she's got another letter. This time it's from ""Percy Wheezily"" saying that the ministry of Magic needs her to go to.....LONDON!.

So we get on a train and that's basically the entire day a train from Edinburgh to London. We get on the train and I give her a small package, its a big bag of Harry Potter themed sweets from Hagrid, you know so we don't get hungry on the train.

Once we got to London obviously we went to the shop at Kings on Platform 9 and 3/4 which was fun got a few gifts, checked into the hotel, went for dinner, got back to the hotel and someone had left her a small package. With in the package is a note from ""Garrick Ollivander"" saying that Dumbledore wanted to send her a gift for her birthday and to make up for the ""incident"" last night (the escape room) and chose to send her a wand... 

**Monday** 

So this was fun...

So she gets up and another letter this time from ""Dumbledore"" telling her to be at platform 9 and 3/4 by 11am. 

So we get to the station and are standing outside the shop when I hit her with the big surprise....HER PARENTS!, I arranged for them to fly over to celebrate with us and they surprised her at the shop. Was amazing, there where tears. After that we let the bomb drop that we were going to the Harry Potter Studio tour (this has been something she has always wanted to do and nagged me about doing for years). It was again, amazing. 

That night we go for dinner, me, her and her folks, when I give her her gift its a special golden snitch pendent and another letter. This time from ""Harry Potter"" that was rather funny but said that she needed to know the rest of his story. Within her birthday card were two tickets to Harry Potter and the cursed child. 

**Tuesday.** 

To keep this short (sorry long thread I know), basically I kept the morning free for her and her folks to catch up as they were flying home in the afternoon. Then at about 2pm we went off to the theatre to watch the play, both parts, and yes I know that the story is controversial but honestly seeing it live as its supposed to be enjoyed it was amazing. 

That night there was another letter from ""Hermonie"" saying that she had to get an early night because tomorrow morning she had to go and sit a wizarding exam. 

**Wednesday.** 

When we woke, we discovered that a house elf had got into our hotel room and wrote her yet another letter but also left the strange gift of socks. But we had no time to think on that because we had an exam to get to!

Well that exam was actually another escape room which although fun was not as good as the one we had done a few nights ago in Edinburgh. After this the next letter was from ""Ron"" saying that Hermione was mental and that his dad had booked us on a tour for muggles. We missed the tour due to not being able to find the starting point but I was not deterred. I had done my home work and knew all the sites I needed to show her! So we done a funny impromptu amateur true of the Harry Potter sites of London. 

At this point she was getting a bit jittery and even a little annoyed with me dragging her round London, but I had planned for this so, gave her a "" howler"" send by ""Umbridge"" basically telling her to shut up and just go with it. 

Then she gets a letter from a rather angry ""Snape"" telling her that she has to attend one of his potions classes....which was actually just afternoon tea at a cafe called Cutter &amp; Squidge. Now if am honest this was the worst bit of it all, I didn't feel I got value for money but was still something fun and Harry Potter themed the hostess was amazing. 

So by the end of the day we get back to the hotel where there is one final letter, a personal letter from me this time and no I am not giving any details of it publicly but it was nice. 

**Thursday.** 

Thursday was crap....we had to get a really long train home and there where no seats for a long portion of the journey.

4426,Deseniato,1556464550,"Hello guys,

It's been a lot of years since I've seen all the Harry Potter movies but watching a ""Top 10 weird facts about Harry Potter""-Video on YouTube a long forgotten question I had while watching the movies reappeared in my thoughts. It concerns Tom Riddle, his Horcruxes and the conversation he had with Slughorn (I even rewatched the scene to make sure my memories weren't playing games with me). So here we go:

For all we know, during the movies Voldemort thought he had created 6 Horcruxes, splitting his soul 6 times. He didn't know Harry was a Horcrux. If I remember correctly his plan was to only create 6 Horcruxes (please correct me if I'm wrong and in that case stop reading this post because what follows is wrong, too then). Anyhow, while he was still Tom Riddle and talking to Slughorn, he asked the professor what would happen, if he created 7 Horcruxes, in which case his plan must have been to create 7, right? However, if he DID know that he had created 7 Horcruxes, he must have known that Harry was one of them, right? I mean if some little brats knew it, how could the high lord of darkness not?

But if he did know that Harry was a Horcrux, why would he want to kill him? It's like if I were to cut off my arm. It doesn't make sense. Instead of killing him, he should've just captured him and kept him alive (or maybe move his soul from Harry to another object, if that's possible).

So in the end, was it a mistake in the script when Tom asked Slughorn about 7 Horcruxes, or was Voldemurt just that dumb (or am I just dumb because I'm not getting obvious facts)?

&amp;#x200B;

I do think there's evidence in the books that she had human qualities, though. Her behaviour in the Godric's Hollow chapter of Deathly Hallows was extremely cognizant. She could communicate on a human level.

&amp;#x200B;

So could the snake in the zoo in Philosopher's Stone, but still. Nagini seemed to be more than just an average snake.

&amp;#x200B;

And Voldemort seemed to really care for her. He couldn't love, but what he felt for Nagini seemed to come closer to it than anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

And she was a Horcrux. Meaning she had a bit of Voldemort's soul inside her. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if, when Voldemort was speaking to Nagini, he wasn't speaking to her but to the big of himself inside her. We know that Horcruxes have sentience. And Voldemort cared for no one other than himself. What if the affection he expressed towards Nagini was really self-love? Maybe Nagini's consciousness is trapped inside the snake, watching everything that's happening, but unable to do anything about it? In that case, what Neville did could be seen as an act of mercy.",harrypotter,Nagini Theory,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bibwyw/nagini_theory/,1556433782.0

Two main reasons why:

1. He was always using a broom that was much better than his opponents’ brooms (except against Malfoy in CoS). This doesn’t mean he was less skillful, but if you’re already playing at an advantage, it makes winning the game much easier. 
2. His total record at Hogwarts was 7-2. That’s a pretty good record (and his 2 losses were for reasons out of his control), but it’s a small sample size. Bottom line he didn’t play enough games and there’s probably been several players in past years with equivalent or better records for more games played. 

I’m not saying he wasn’t skilled, in fact, he could’ve been one of the most skilled seekers ever.

4472,MCMIVC,1556416007,"My theory/hope for Queenie's fate in future films is for her to have an arch similar to Edmund Pevensie in ""The Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe"". A family member and close ally of the main protagonists seduced to join/support the enemy and eventually realizes they've made a mistake and rejoins the heros.

Here's how I see things playing out:

**FB 3:**  
Throughout this film Queenie will struggle with the choice she's made, and eventually realize she's chosen the wrong side. Perhaps some of the things she is expected to do for the cause become too much her. She will then attempt to rejoin the main gang either at the end of this film or (more likely in my opinion) the start/middle of the next film

**FB 4:**  
Queenie is attempting to rejoin the heros again, however they are obviously distrustfull of her. Maybe she tries to stall for time to work against Grindelwald from the inside for a while and when the heros find out, this is what makes them slowly start to trust her again. Regardless, Queenie has towards this films end completely left Grindelwald's side to rejoin the heros. Depending on the the severity of actions she may or may not have commited in Grindelwald's name, the authorites may want her locked up, or maybe even executed, thus having the film end with Queenie imprisoned or on the run, but secretly working with the some members of themain group, who may not completely trust her yet, but are at least willing to give her a chance at redemption.

**FB 5:**  
If Queenie was on the run at the end of the last film, she will still be at the start of this one. If Queenie was imprisoned at the end of the last film, events will transpire to get her out at least before the end of the first act. She will then proceed as if she had just been on the run.  
Queenie spends this film secretly working with the main gang, slowly gaining back their trust and rekindeling her relationship with Jacob. She then massively helps somehow with whatever final events take place. At the very end however, I see four possible outcomes:  
&gt; **1**: She dies in a ""Death equals redemtion"" kinda way, leaving Jacob hearbroken.   
&gt; **2**: She lives and is either given a ligher sentence for helping bring down Grindelwald. Perhaps been banned from performing magic, a short time in jail, or whatever. Or, she is pardoned outright. Eitherway, this ending sees her getting together with Jacob, and they can finally get married legally and happy ending and all that, YAY!  
&gt; **3**: Same as ending 2, she is pardoned or given a lighter punishment, but Jacob dies, leaving Queenie heartbroken.  
&gt; **4**: Both Jacob &amp; Queenie die, leaving Newt and Tina sad over the loss of their best friend and sister respectively.

Personally I believe ending 1 or 4 are the most likely outcome given Rowling's track record, but since I'm such a sucker for sentimental solutions, I'm really hoping for ending 2, as unlikely as it is. Jacob and Queenie were just too precious in the first film to waste. I'm still rooting for these two, and hoping that Rowling is not gonna go on a final-installment-killing-spree again.

Those are my predictions at least. Agree/disagree? What are your thoughts? I'll end this by saying that despite the popular opinion, I LOVED Crimes of Grindelwald, and don't mind any of the more upsetting twists and turns. I just think that makes it more fun to look forward to and speculate/theorize about future installments, as is clear from this post I should think.",harrypotter,My Theory/predictions about Queenie's fate in future FB films,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bi68xk/my_theorypredictions_about_queenies_fate_in/,1556387207.0

1. **She interferes at Hogwarts** 

&gt; ""'I'll tell you what it means,' said Hermione through gritted teeth.
&gt; 'It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.'""

 Terrific, oversight seems very reasonable. The ministry is only there because last year the headmaster decided to bring back a sporting event that was cancelled because of *too many deaths*, and a student immediately died again. The surrounding events are confusing, (readers [have](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/18122/why-was-the-triwizard-cup-portkey-in-goblet-of-fire-two-way) [a lot](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/23194/during-priori-incantatem-how-did-cedric-bertha-lily-and-james-know-so-much-i?rq=1) [of questions](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/129193/how-did-harry-know-that-the-portkey-was-layered)), but it's rooted in the fact that the headmaster hired a close friend despite a consensus this person was unhinged, and the friend wound up being a serial-killer. The headmaster didn't notice his old friend was actually someone completely different. This is different than the close friend the headmaster hired two years ago who attacked students as a werewolf... or the hire four years ago who attacked students in the murder-dungeon (why is that in a school, again?)... or the hire three years ago who attacked students and tried to wipe their memory (same year the board of trustees voted to have the headmaster removed for incompetency)... In fact, the ministry wouldn't be here at all, *even given all this*, if the headmaster had been able to hire a new DADA teacher. 


----------


2. **She doesn't want to teach *applied* DADA**. Makes sense to me, ([other](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/7436/does-hogwarts-teach-non-magical-classes) [readers](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/7436/does-hogwarts-teach-non-magical-classes?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1) [are confused](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/18556/did-defense-against-the-dark-arts-before-barty-crouch-teach-any-actual-defense) about the curriculum too); the kids aren't learning math, should murder class really be anything more than academic? Yes, the last teacher had them practice torture spells, but I agree with Umbridge tbh, probably not a terrific idea. You can disagree with her pedagogy here, but it's hard to form a case this is ""evil"". Muggle parents get upset over books with swears in them, I can't imagine what they'd say if we were practicing torture methods in gym class.


----------


3. **Umbridge doesn't believe Cedric was murdered or Voldemort is back**. Um... should she? The facts:
 - **People died... at a death game.** Dumbledore brought back a game cancelled because of all the deaths - Dragon-Provoking was round two - and someone died. That isn't.... super duper unexpected.  
 - **Harry is traumatized and not making much sense** After returning Harry is immediately assaulted by a teacher. He starts babbling things like '*the person I fear most came back from the dead and all these important people in my life were Death Eaters. Oh no not the three death eaters sitting with you at the time, those were the ONLY three that didn't show. And my dead parents were there too! Then the portkey brought me back to here for some reason*'. Okay... Keep in mind other students had been confudus'd or imperious'd already during the  event.
 - **The story is full of holes, with an obvious alternate explanation**. The portkey thing [is the smallest part that doesn't make sense](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/18122/why-was-the-triwizard-cup-portkey-in-goblet-of-fire-two-way). And you defeated Voldemort AGAIN to escape?! The serial killer in the room has claimed responsibility for the death of the student, which kind of fits. 
 - **Dumbledore makes a terrible case**. He doesn't say: '*this is kind of my fault*,' or '*let's talk about this away from the traumatized children*'. He says: '*you have to get rid of ALL your prison guards RIGHT NOW*.' Hold up Dumbledore, for a smart guy that wasn't a brilliant thing to say, you sort of sounds like a crank. 
 - **Nobody else believes Harry** Maybe that's why not just the minister of magic and the major newspaper, but the International Wizemgemot too think Dumbledore is crazy. Of course, Harry claims all those people are bought-and-paid-for... but do have any independent reason to believe that about the international community? It's not unheard of for famous people to become ranting conspiracy theorists in their old age, and Occam's razor agrees with Dolores *and almost everyone else in the wizarding world* on this one. If this makes Dolores evil, is like, the whole wizarding world evil too? 


----------


4. **She has Harry write lines for detention, in his own blood, leading to permanent scars**. This is definitely icky, but lets look at it in context. 

 - **This is a milder wizard detention than others we've seen** The morally unimpeachable McGonagall's detention pick for *first year students out past curfew* was going into the *forbidden forest*, unaccompanied except by a fearful dog, to hunt down a thing that was killing unicorns. Wait, what? Everyone almost died to a monster, unsurprisingly, until a centaur saved them against its nature. Especially in comparison to what Filch admits happened in living memory, writing lines doesn't seem so bad:

&gt; ""It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by
&gt; your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still
&gt; in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed"" - Filch

  - **Harry can't stay out of detention** It's extra gross because of the blood component, but that's mostly for ick factor - the scars clearly aren't meant to be permanent (other students have them wear right off) - but Harry *keeps* getting detention. Unjustly? He stands up the very first day of class and shouts at the teacher that she's a liar. He disrupts constantly. He gets into fist fights, and tries to start an army at school. From Umbridge's perspective, she has a very distributed young student, and giving him detention far lighter than McGonagall assigned to mischievous freshman is about in-line with what we've seen in-universe.


----------


5. **She tries to stop Dumbledore's Army**. Umbridge gets a credible tip that a troublesome student is trying to - checks notes - start an army to overthrow her and the government. What does she do? Requests that official school clubs register with the school, something that almost every school in the world already does. (It's also a good way to allocate funding - two birds one stone!) She doesn't go on the war path or interrogate anyone out the gate. It's only when the students *go ahead and secretly start revolution club anyways* that she starts a low-key investigation, with the support of many of the existing students at the school. You know, the ones who want to learn from the book, and not foster guerilla armies.


----------


4. **She suspends the Griffindore Quidditch team**. 
 - Nothing she has done has gotten through to Harry - he's still on a downward spiral that (SPOILER) leads to him getting his godfather killed and wrecking Dumbeldore's office. Literally no adult is supporting this kid emotionally. Other members of the Quidditch team - the Weasley twins - are so well known for their misbehavior that it's a meme; they wind up dropping out and ruining exams. Maybe this is what will get through to them that they need to behave - can you imagine if half of the soccer team at your highschool was constantly in detention and violent? Telling the team they need to behave academically to maintain their sport sounds pretty reasonable to me. 
 - What happens when Dolores gets overruled? The *very first game* the players get into fist fights. Yikes, guess she was right. Btw, what's McGonagall's game here in going over Umbridge's head - McGonagall believes there's a serial killer mounting a coup and this is the hill she dies on?


----------


5. *She files for more power*. What other options did she have? She was a government auditor brought in because students were routinely dying or getting maimed, and she literally can't discipline students by - checks notes - kicking them off a sports team? She's being blocked at the most basic levels of discipline. 


----------


6. **She audits the teachers, firing good ol' Hagrid and Trelawney**. 

&gt; ""'I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old
&gt; fraud."" - Hermione.
&gt; 

&gt; ""The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge
&gt; within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation,
&gt; hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it"".

 This is strong evidence in her favor. If she was really just trying to set up Harry and Dumbledore, she would have immediately gone to fire McGonagall and Snape, his two closest allies. After all, she had wide latitude in interpreting the audit results. But she doesn't, she passes McGonagall with flying colors  and she questions Sanpe on his former ties to terrorism and evident lack of full trust from the headmaster - both fair questions. Trelawney isn't even a real teacher, she's just a pawn in some long term chess game that Dumbledore is playing (he laughs that he'd give her a raise after her third actual prediction). The trio feels bad for Hagrid, but Hermione had long said he was a terrible (sometimes dangerous) teacher with no qualifications who was hired because... why again? The trio didn't even want to take his class, even as his close personal friend. Not to mention all the class he's been skipping, or the *several* dangerous human-eating monsters he's secretly brought to or near campus. The school has had a lot of hiring problems recently, most famously the serial killer masquerading as Dumbledore's best friend: these are the exact type of things a responsible auditor would scrutinize.


----------


7. **She threatens Harry with an unforgivable curse and Azkaban.** Let's look at the scene: a lot of waving her wand and dramatically flipping over Fudge's picture. Not a lot of actual spellcasting. If you think Umbridge is evil, then the will to do this fits with her style, but even so, it should seem *extremely* out-of-character. She follows the book to-the-t. She doesn't fire McGonagall or Snape, even when legalistically she could, because she's religiously bound by the law. She concedes immediately when Dumbledore hires a new Divinitation professor and insists Trelawny stays on campus even though it's all highly irregular. She always diligently files for more power, she doesn't stretch the power she already has - bureaucracy is her favorite thing in the world. Can you really imagine her casting unforgivable curses not just in front of a ton of witnesses, but the children of important and powerful Ministry Officials, like Malfoy? Sure, they like her, but that sounds like a rumor that'll spread. And for what gain? To save some time that doesn't need to be saved. This seems like textbook every teacher or procedural-cop-show ever: ""oh if you don't confess right this second we'll expel you/throw you in prison/tell your parents/whatever."" Threatening emptily is very in-character - and it worked (sort of). Actually doing it would be wildly un-Umbridgey and downright stupid. 


----------


8. **She insults the centaurs**. Out of universe, centaurs may be stand-ins for any number of marginalized groups. But in universe... they... don't really make great metaphors. They brutally attack each other and school characters repeatedly. We don't see them doing almost anything else. She seems afraid of them immediately and they... violently assault her leaving her catatonic in the hospital. They were provoked, surely, but saying they were justified is a *lot* of latitude. We see this with Werewolves too - out of universe, we think of them as symbols of discrimination, but in-universe, the only two Werewolves we see are Lupin and Greyback. The former - a certified ""good guy"" - attacks and almost kills his best friend and students because he loses control in his first book, and the latter gleefully attacks and murders people constantly. Without projecting our out-of-universe biases, I'm not sure we have enough information to say whether the metaphor really holds up.


----------


9. **She sends the dementors after Harry**. But does she? 

&gt; ""'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore. 

&gt; 'I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of
&gt; Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!' barked Fudge. 

&gt; 'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the
&gt; Ministry of Magic these days.'""

Right, Dumbledore thinks Voldemort did it. In fact, this is the exact thing Dumbledore warned Fudge about at the end of the last book. In the next book it's confirmed Voldemort is controlling the dementors, and in this book there's a prison break that highly suggests it. How would Umbridge have done this without a paper trail? Waltz up to the most guarded prison on Earth and politely ask the guards? More to the point, *why* would she? Did she genuinely hate this kid she'd never met so much to take such a huge personal risk? Again, it's wildly out of character - everything we *directly* see her do is to-the-letter legal. She *loves* laws. So why'd she say she did it? Well, it's in the same monologue as (8) - Harry challenges whether her threat is serious and she goes 'oh I'm super duper serious, I even sent those dementors just like you thought I did!!'. Right, sure. This seems like more evidence that 8 was empty threats. Even when Umbridge is headmaster, she doesn't expel Harry without cause even though she could without risk, but she risks it all to kill him out the gate? Hmm.


----------


10. **She participates in a court against non pure-bloods**. Not a great look. But keep in mind she'd (SPOILER) had a Horcrux on for months at this point. When Ron had to carry the same Horcrux, on and off, for a little while, he straight up abandons his friends and the fate of the world and goes home to his brother. Ginny hung out with a diary Horcrux and tried to murder half the school and a few chickens and a cat. Dumbledore got hoodwinked by a horcrux in like 2 seconds (could be unrelated, admittedly). We don't damn those characters, so let's give Umbridge the same benefit.


----------

11. **She uses Veritaserum on students**
 - Snape says 

&gt; ""Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry
&gt; guidelines"" 

and she seems like the exact person in place to file for that kind of approval.

----------


**What do characters outside the trio think?**

Percy praises her. Fudge has promoted her to undersecretary. And importantly, Scrimgeour keeps her onboard too. We can nitpick the first two, but Scrimgeour is a pretty ethical dude - he dies under torture to keep Harry safe. Madam Bones seems to work closely with her and everyone loves Bones. The people who have worked with her all give her the marks of a practical and diligent public servant.

**Conclusion:**

Through the eyes of a teenager, Umbridge is the ultimate evil - just like we all thought our least-favorite teacher was in high school, but with higher stakes. I think this is a good thing - Umbridge is written well as a character with enough internal justification for her actions that perspective matters, and that's rare in a children's story chalk full of serial killers. Taken together, a little supervision in a school where children are constantly dying or being put in near-death scenarios sounds not just great, but the minimum responsibility of the government. Dumbledore may be a great resistance warrior, but he's a questionable educator. Harry might be a decent chosen-one, but he's not a model student. Umbridge may not be a good enabler-of-prophecy, but do we need to keep ragging on the one teacher who actually wants to school to be a place of... learning (no offense to Mr. Binns)?",harrypotter,Genuine take: Umbridge is a good guy with an unfair rap - and I have evidence,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bi18qo/genuine_take_umbridge_is_a_good_guy_with_an/,1556356415.0
4506,15_Redstones,1556384132,"So, I've been thinking about all the time related magic portrayed in canon (mostly PoA), and there appear to be 3 different, but connected types:

-Divination by generating and interpreting semi-random patterns, like tea leaves, crystal balls, etc. It's what's taught in Divination class and it's what Hermione doesn't believe in because it's too wooly, although it does seem to create true, although not too useful predictions.

-True Prophecy, we see both the original one and the one Harry witnesses in PoA come true. They aren't a semi-random pattern but a short piece of text that will eventually come true, no matter what, although it's impossible to tell just how exactly it will happen.

-The Time Turner creates a closed time loop where events the time traveler witnessed cannot be changed, but the way in which they happen can. For example, they hear the axe sound and assume that Buckbeak got executed and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happening, but they can change the reason so that Buckbeak survives. Also, Harry knows for sure that their past selves will be saved since he witnessed it and thus is able to save them since it doesn't change anything.

The nature of time travel is that anything that has happened that the traveler knows about cannot be changed, only things that the traveler doesn't know can since that way it already has happened without the traveler knowing.

Any information about events carried back in time causes the events to happen, no matter what the traveler does. Only details not known to the traveler can be changed. 

Just like true Prophecies will always happen, but details not mentioned in the text of the Prophecy can be changed.

**Any information carried back in time is essentially a Prophecy.**

Hermione knows that there will be an axe sound since she has witnessed it, and thus it essentially creates a Prophecy ""Hermione will hear an axe sound at that moment"" that cannot be avoided.

The HP universe, by its very nature, doesn't allow split timelines. If information is carried back in time, it cannot prevent itself from happening. Paradoxes cannot happen.

You cannot travel back and kill your grandfather and prevent yourself from existing, since you exist. If you do manage to go back in time and kill your grandfather as a kid, then that wasn't your real grandfather.

Both Divination and Prophecy are probably based on the same magic as time turners, but they work in reverse: A time turner sends information (the person using it) back in time, Divination is magic that fetches random bits of information from the future (a pet dying, someone leaving), Prophecy is important information randomly traveling back in time into a seers mind.

In each case the information from the future will turn true since it's known that it will happen, but the details that didn't travel back in time can be changed.

It all fits together. Time travel in the HP universe is possible, paradox-free and when you think about it makes more sense than 95% of time travel fiction, including Back to the Future and Avengers: Endgame. 

And sorry Hermione, Divination isn't bullshit. It's wooly and not too useful since you're pulling random bits of information from the future and placing them into a semi-random pattern in front of you, but it's a legit form of time magic capable of making accurate predictions.

4538,Trevor-Wilmot-author,1556341201,"I just finished my rereading of the series and chapter 35: Kings Cross, was really well done and explained a lot of things that could and should be included in the Fantastic Beasts series. Not only did Dumbledore explain about how Voldemort had a major flaw in his plan 
, he gave us more insight in his past involving Grindelwald, his family, and the Deathly 
 Hallows.  

As a student in Hogwarts he was a gifted wizard and he had a bright future ahead of him. But he had pain inside him because his six year old sister named Ariana was bullied by muggles who spied on her though a garden hedge, she was using magic that she couldn’t control yet. That day she was afraid of using magic for the rest of her short life. Percival, the father, found the muggles who attacked her, and was sent to Azkaban for assaulting them. Instead of admitting that his daughter was mad, he accepted his life in the wizard prison. 

Kendra, the mother, moved them to Godric’s Hallow where she kept her daughter inside for her safety. Everyone thought Ariana was a Squib, but she was most likely an Obscurial, since she was said to be very dangerous. When Ariana was fourteen she accidentally killed her own mother since she couldn’t control herself, and her mother couldn’t calm her down, only Aberforth could, but he was at Hogwarts. 

Instead of traveling with his friend Elphias Doge, Albus had to go back home to look after the unstable sister. He hated it because he knew he had a bright future, he could be anywhere and doing anything he wanted, but he was stuck caring for his sister, so naturally he longed for more, even if he loved his family. 

Then one day Grindelwald decided to travel to Godric’s hallow because he was looking for the Hallows and he stayed with his great-aunt Bathilda Bagshot during the summer, who happened to be neighbors with Dumbledore. For two whole months these friends were inseparable making up plans to conquer the Wizarding world together and be the Masters of Death with the Hallows. Albus lost his dad to muggles, his sister was bullied by them, so naturally he had resentment towards them, only made worse by Gellert.

It was for “The Greater Good “, which was their slogan. Dumbledore fell for Grindelwald because he was free, he was an equal, he was manipulating Albus, he was in pain, he wanted more and Grindelwald was the solution, at least he though that. For a long time Albus knew Grindelwald was a dark wizard, but he told himself otherwise until Aberforth showed up to end their friendship since Albus was neglecting his sister, and Grindelwald fought first until all three of them were dueling, until Ariana was hit by a spell and was dead. Albus finally realized he was in the wrong and was manipulated by his best friend. 

The whole relationship was for two months and for those two months Grindelwald had only two things in his mind, the Hallows and to conquer the Wizarding World, with or without Dumbledore. Jk Rowling announced that Dumbledore was gay, which I accept. I see how he fell for Grindelwald. And I can see how Grindelwald fell for Dumbledore. What I don’t see is them having a sexual relationship or kissing and etc. It was strictly emotional and their number one goal is to be the Master Of Death to conquer the world. There was no time for any of that sort, except emotionally into each other. None would actually come forth with it, especially Grindelwald since he was only using Dumbledore, but he eventually  fell for him, which I’m sure he would ignore as much as possible. What Dumbledore said in this chapter explained it perfectly. I might get hate for this by people who want them to show kissing and what not. But don’t you all agree that it would be out of character?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't worry - I've read the book just about as many times. Out of the series, GOF is my favorite and because of that I've read it the most - It's got the most ""fun"" for me - the Quidditch world cup, and all the Triwizard challenges, as well as the flood of additional wizards and witches from the two other schools - it's got a very different format than all the other books, outside of the 7th, I would say.

&amp;#x200B;

*However*, I've finally got it through my thick skull that Cedric's death is truly a turning point in the entire series! As Albus says, ""Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy."" and in the movie (not the book?) Hermione says, ""everything's going to change now isn't it?""

&amp;#x200B;

I finally realized the full impact of those words!!! They indeed are referring to a deep turning point in the story. Books 5, 6, and 7 get increasingly ""darker"" - in terms of revelations, story, and characters lost :(  I suppose its like a reality check for the reader like, hey, this isn't your snow white and the seven dwarves anymore!!

&amp;#x200B;

I realized this is perhaps a major reason why book 4 stands out so much for me. It's the last book that is really about the more fun and magic parts of the harry potter world before seriously diving in to the Voldemort / Horcrux / wizard war plot line (not saying the following books dont have fun parts or that the story is any less excellent - just the nature of the story itself is a bit darker)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I guess I don't really know what I'm trying to say. Truthfully (if you haven't noticed at this point) I'm a bit buzzed right now. My girlfriend is out of town; and I'm home alone drinking some brews. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'll say it: I'm 27, of course not the oldest harry potter fan by any means, but somewhere in my heart these books just make me feel like i'm back in junior high again, exhasperatedly waiting for the next book, and subsequently devouring it at some random picnic table in the park, gasping when professor mcgonagall casts that imperious curse (I know you all did too ;) ), and reading some more until the summer light was too dim to allow you to read anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

This story, these books, these characters, they will never leave me. I just feel - no matter what changes in my life, I know there is always the rock that is harry potter that I can go to.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the movies, (and of course the soundtrack!), well, I think my opinion is clear - they were SO well done! I can't seem to let a year pass without watching at least one of the films! Hell, who am I kidding - I usually can't go a year without rewatching the whole series! :)

Here's where things get interesting. Many of these squibs are either killed or are sent into the muggle world. Over time I believe these squibs marry and have children and these children have children and so on. It is likely that a long period of time is needed to counter act the effects of this inbreeding. For this reason it would make sense that nobody in family would remember a past history of witchcraft. Eventually the bad genetics would be filtered out.

I posted earlier this week with a survey asking for this sub's favorite character from the Harry Potter series (If you haven't voted, feel free to do so [here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0U10qPVmdm3cU8JZOUWl3tgqOWz71Br3SxLgTe5Se1IB5Fw/viewform?usp=sf_link)). After giving it a few days, the responses have stopped coming in, so I am now sharing the results!

I received **42 responses** representing **17** unique answers. For now, it's a good start and there are some interesting trends early on, but I'd love to gather even more.

I compiled all of the results into the following [graphs](https://imgur.com/a/yA3xiUi) which you I are clear enough to flip through. If you're interested, the data was organized onto the graphs after being transferred from the voting form to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TquhGIZc1HJFdSpT0E9wjpEvcE3XhO1KyR9Bsr64RGw/edit?usp=sharing).

With the amount of votes received having such a variety of responses (we could barely go 2 votes before getting another new character named), the list quickly sorts itself out into tiers. 

So far we get the following:

Character | # Votes | Gryffindor | Hufflepuff | Ravenclaw | Slytherin
---------|-------|----------|----------|---------|---------
Sirius Black | 6 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1
Hermione Granger | 5 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0
Luna Lovegood | 5 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 0
Ginny Weasley | 4 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0
Ron Weasley | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0
Remus Lupin | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0

before any form of pattern fades away with the less-popular characters (so far!).

**Interesting Findings**

* Ravenclaw leads the houses with 17 votes (G:12, H:8, S:5).

* Hermione has received 0 votes from her own house, but finds herself in 2nd place due to strong support from Ravenclaw (and Hufflepuff!).

* Sirius Black is the only character with votes from every house.

* Severus Snape's two votes are both from Slytherins, while Harry Potter's two come from Gryffindor.

* 0 respondents listed themselves as unsorted.

Thanks for voting and for reading! If more responses come in, I will update the graphs/spreadsheets and report back with some hopefully more clear trends.",harrypotter,[RESULTS Part 1] Favorite Character Survey!,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bhrjj5/results_part_1_favorite_character_survey/,1556284451.0

Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.
‘I was watching that, Potty!' he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. ‘Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy –'"" The Half Blood Prince Chapter 19

So:

* Peeves can apparate, or a form of travel similar to apparition.

* Peeves can apparate inside anti-wizard apparition enchantments. So it may be similar to house elf apparition in this way.

* Peeves can follow house elves (at least) to their apparition destination, which is seemingly impossible for wizards to do to other wizards, much less house elves.  Though it is possible that Peeves can detect high(er) level mischief or conflict inside Hogwarts and go to it.

This may be a function of how Peeves exists, as he was created as a by-product of building and enchanting Hogwarts as far as we know. So he could have a parasitic or symbiotic relationship with the building and the magic there.  Regardless, I'd say this is a horrifying insight to Peeves' abilities.


Everyone wants to go to Hogwarts but holy fuck I would be scared to sleep in that place because of this poltergeist.

I'm not gonna deny how rude he was being to Harry and his friends, that was really bad. I however have sympathy for Severus since he grew up in an abusive household, stumbled upon Lily's corpse, and then was given the task to kill Dumbledore. He went through a lot of traumatic events. 

I didn't care too much about Severus in the books, it was Alan Rickman's performance in the movies that just made me drawn to Severus (watched the movies before reading the books). Alan was able to convey a character that was neither entirely good or evil, he was a grey character with tremendous flaws and skills. Where his loyalty lies was the most important aspect once Dumbledore died and he chose his love for Lily over his loyalty to Voldemort.

From the beginning, he was portrayed as a villain, then a good guy, then it goes back and forth throughout the series, ultimately ending with him choosing the good side. [The Snape's memories scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHolRZeQNG4) in the deathly hallows part 2 was [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyf-kJWwIg).

4654,Marawal,1556229304,"So, I was thinking about muggle-born children. And there's something a bit weird here : it's how the british government don't seems to worry a lot about dozens of kids stopping to go to school at 11, and not being enrolled in any public or private school anywhere. And well, how can you claim you homeschool a kid that is never here? I mean I'm not from the U.K, but I hope they do check on homeschool kids from time to time to make sure there isn't something shaddy happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it got me thinking and I know have a headcanon.

&amp;#x200B;

There's actually a front school to Hogwart, where muggle-borns are officially enrolled in. Something like ""Saint Arthur Academy for Gifted Children"", or a name like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was created when governments started to think it was a good idea to held parents accountable on how they treated their children, and some muggle-born parents got in trouble because their kids were disappearing for 10 months and no one knew were they were, and parents couldn't say. (Or were saying stupid tales about a Magic School).

&amp;#x200B;

Their Hogwarts  classes and extra-curriculum activities and grades are magically translate into muggles ones. (For example, a O in Potion would be an A+ in Chemistry....""Captain of Quidditch Team"" would become ""Captain of soccer team"" something along those lines).

&amp;#x200B;

It would also help the kids during holidays breaks to talk about school and their life, without breaking the secrecy.

&amp;#x200B;

And when they're adult, they're also are given what is the muggle equivalent of their job, and some of their activities.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I decided that there's a whole shelves of parenting books at Flourish and Botts for parents of Muggle-Borns to help them out. And yes, Hermione's parents read all of them.",harrypotter,Some of my headcannons about muggle-borns.,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bhefki/some_of_my_headcannons_about_muggleborns/,1556200504.0

4681,brackattack12,1556215367,"I was in elementary school when the Harry Potter frenzy began to reach its fever pitch. It seemed like most of my classmates were consuming the books with a voracious intensity. I come from a religious family, and at the time, my mother decreed that us kids shouldn't read the books. She had been scared by other hyper-religious friends, I suppose. (She has come around since, thank goodness). So my mother's admonishment combined with my general distaste of sci-fi/fantasy, I fastidiously avoid the HP fanfare. I didn't read the books, I still haven't seen the movies, I was clueless when it came to houses, etc. As I grew older, I felt that I had out-grown the books and that the HP had sailed for me. I was confused on why grown adults were still so obsessed with these children's books. Feeling that some people were just too eager to escape reality and play out some childish fantasy, I began to look down on my peers. Despite my sister badgering me to read the series, I refused. My biggest fear was that I would somehow be perceived as 'that person' that I  disliked so much.  

&amp;#x200B;

One day last February, for a reason unbeknownst to myself, I decided to listen to the first book on Audible. I have a long commute some weekends and listening to books is a great way to pass the time. I had just finished an unrelated book and saw Harry Potter on the main screen. I had a credit to spend, and I just decided ""why not"". I would have never expected the result. A little over two months later, I finished the series. Hearing Jim Dale narrated the final pages last night left me more emotional than I could have ever predicted. I can finally say I get it. I get it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have become so attached to these characters and this universe. I empathized with Snape. I loved to HATE Umbridge. I gallivanted with Sirius. I laughed at Fred &amp; George. I felt hatred, and then an affinity for, Draco. I shook my head at Hagrid and his creatures. I ran the gamut of emotions when it came to Harry; he was so stubborn at times but also so kind-hearted. I learned from Dumbledore; learned more perhaps than from any other piece of fiction that I've ever encountered. Perhaps this is the moment of my life that I was meant to read these books. I don't think the lessons would've had such a profound impact had I read them years ago. I'm just simply thankful that these books exist at the same time I do so I can share in the enjoyment.

I can't find a Latin translation of the motto though, so I tried to put one together.  I think literally it could be ""Ingenium inmensum ops summa hominibi,"" literally ""Immeasurable genius faculty is the greatest resource of mankind.""

That is why I decided to put all new beasts, shown to us in the trailer and promo, together at one poster. I really liked the contrast between the disturbing reality and the bright, pure world of Newt's deep love for his creatures in the first film. Among the gray streets, witch hunters, wars and future tragedies, the journey to Newt's suitcase becomes a real breath of clean air, pure magic! You can see such beasts here: Nagini, Thestral, ZouWu, Kelpie, Leucrotta, Augurey, Matagot, Bowtruckle, Chupakabra and baby Niffler. Also before I saw the film I supposed that Newt was using Appaloosa Puffskein to calm Zouwu down, so at the art Newt is holding it with LeviOsa to distruct beast's attention from all others, but Kelpie is still nervous about this huge lion-like creature :-\)  ](https://i.redd.it/yajpc2sr3fu21.png)

Mostly about social equality and technological advancement. Like, do they keep up on scientific knowledge gathered by muggles; or do they totally disregard research on biology and chemistry? well, I did not get many clear answers in this area.

I was thinking on it afterward, and I began wondering about space. Do any of the magic governments have a space program? Surely, with so many uses of magic, there is a way to reach and perform activities in space.

I recently read a book by Harry Turtledove called, The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump. In it, the author explored how the modern world would develop if advanced technology never took off. Instead, most of our modern advances and conveniences were replicated using a wide array of magical methods. The Main character even visits a company developing a magical solution to reaching space.

4729,HouseOfSteak,1556167109,"Take for example the Whomping Willow - a powerful tree that will attempt to kill any and everyone via heavy bludgeoning if anyone get slightly within striking distance of the thing. The tree clearly has no actual protections (aside from the sturdiness that comes with being a tree), so a half-competent wizard could fight back to protect themselves, but then damaging the tree would probably yield punishment.  


The faculty is clearly aware of this and highly competent (being able to create a barrier that can stop and incinerate an entire Dark Wizard and monster army, save Voldemort, around the entire school, or prevent all teleportation spells), so any of them could easily just enchant the area around the tree to repel people from getting close, or turning the ground itself into the same consistency of a safety net so anyone hit wouldn't have the second collision to worry about, the latter which could also be applied to Quidditch, which regularly causes weeks or months-long stays at the hospital wing.  


It would be slightly more understandable if Hogwarts was more of a university, with competent, reasonable adult students who *probably* won't do something that highly violates common sense, but exposing dangers to 11-year olds without any proactive measures to ensure nobody gets hurt is rather short-sighted, to say the least.

We all know for basically a fact, that the way the Marauder’s Map was created, was because of the Potter invisibility cloak. After all, wouldn’t you notice a stag, a dog, or rat trying to “sneak” around Hogwarts castle? I sure would! Therefore, I think the only explanation for the Map is that James Potter had the Cloak during his school years at Hogwarts castle.

BUT...

J. K. Rowling writes on Pottermore:

“Fleamont and Euphemia lived long enough to see James marry a Muggle-born girl called Lily Evans, but not to meet their grandson, Harry. Dragon pox carried them off within days of each other, due to their advanced age, and James Potter then inherited Ignotus Peverell’s Invisibility Cloak.”

if James potter did not get the cloak until after his Hogwarts years, when he married, how the heck did he make the Map with his friends and sneak around Hogwarts castle without being detected?

4750,Spinindyemon,1556149787,"Seriously, one prisoner escapes from Azkaban supposedly to kill a student (Harry) and rather than sending Aurors (the people trained to fight and capture Dark wizards) to safeguard Hogwarts  Fudge decides it would be a better idea to assign a horde of immoral, soul sucking emotion draining demons to safeguard Britain’s only magical school. What the hell made Fudge even consider this in the first place? Is the Auror department really so lackluster that the Dementors were the better option?  Sirius Black had already escaped Azkaban and shown himself to be immune to the Dementors’ despair inducing effects so using Dementors to subdue him would be pointless and he could use he Patronus Charm to repel them. The Aurors though had managed to subdue him when he was allegedly caught committing his mass murderer so why not send the Aurors again to catch him. At least with the Aurors you don’t have to worry abt them trying to eat the populace.

Why wasn’t there even more of  an uproar from concerned parents to remove the soul sucking monstrosities away from their children? Apart from Dumbledore forbidding Dementors into the school and Rosmerta the barmaid from the Three Broomsticks complaining abt the Dementors driving away customers, we never heard about anyone, officials, citizens or the newspaper condemning the Ministry for this action. To compare the threat level b/t Sirius and the Dementors. Sirius Black whole powerful is just one man, who has been fought and captured before. The Dementors are unkillable wraiths who cannot be driven off unless you’re capable of casting a Patronus Charm which is noted to be complex enough that even expert wizards have trouble accomplishing it, not to mention they can and will suck out you’re soul essentially rendering you a vegetable and preventing you from passing onto the afterlife. 

You’d think sensationalists like Rita Skeeter would use this to paint the Ministry as incompetent mainly mentioned the attacks on the Hogwarts Express and the Quidditch match and how countless students were left traumatized by the Dementor’s soul draining. As well as writing about how Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived, the person the Ministry was supposed to be protected nearly getting killed twice, passing out to near death on the train in the 1st attack and falling off his broom in the 2nd attack and it was only through luck that he didn’t die",harrypotter,PoA: Why wasn’t there more of an uproar over Fudge sending Dementors to Hogwarts to catch Sirius Black?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bh1s0m/poa_why_wasnt_there_more_of_an_uproar_over_fudge/,1556120987.0

Since I started reading the first book, this question has lingered in my mind. Question is, were the Dursley's actually that bad? 

I ask this because, Harry was a baby when he was dropped off at their house. They took care of him through infancy, as in cleaned his shits, etc. So is it possible that somewhere in their hearts they had some love for him?

4759,commander-obvious,1556145145,"Apparently there was a leak last year about a Warner Bros Harry Potter open-world RPG. I'm not sure if this was an MMO or if it was a single player. Personally, I'd prefer a single player game a la Skyrim. WB has been proactively removing the leaked footage, leading me to believe there may be some merit to this leak.

There has been an small amount of discussion on this sub regarding the game, but the major discussions are archived. Here's what I imagine for the game, feel free to add features you want to see:

# Gear

**Wands**: Wands can offer quite a bit of flexibility and potential gameplay mechanics. Wands are made of different types of wood, imbued with different types of magical creature parts and contain varying levels of pliability, allowing for a potentially rich and diverse set of equips for your character.

**Armor**: Seeing as there's lots of magic in HP, enchanted robes and leather suits can offer lots of potential resistances to various kinds of magic.

**Pet**: You can ""equip"" a pet, and the different types of pets offer different stat bonuses and can aid you in certain ways during battle.

# Crafting

Wand crafting, spell crafting and armor enchantments. You can collect ingredients (like in Skyrim) and use wand/spell/enchant recipes to develop your own stuff.

# Combat

""Everyone is a mage"" and the combat is purely focused on ranged wand combat, with hundreds of spells in your arsenal. Dangerous magical creatures can do physical damage, but your wand can deflect physical damage.

# Open-world

I wasn't sure how you'd make it open-world. Hogwarts isn't that big compared to a large world like Skyrim. They could make the forbidden forest a place to level up and gain loot and experience. 

# Gameplay and quests

I'm not sure if the game should focus on being a student at Hogwarts, or if it should focus on something else like being an Auror, or perhaps both. Quests can focus on magical creatures, dueling, exploration (where?) and solving mysteries.

Overall, I think there's potential for a game like this and I think lots of people would buy it, but I'm not sure how the gameplay and open-world would work.",harrypotter,What gameplay features would you like to see in an open-world single-player Harry Potter RPG?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bh0z6r/what_gameplay_features_would_you_like_to_see_in/,1556116345.0

Dobby clearly adores and worships Harry, viewing him as a hero to non-wizard beings such as himself so as far as Dobby was concerned he couldn’t have found a better master than Harry Potter. The first time they met Harry was respectful to Dobby so Dobby wouldn’t expect Harry to mistreat him. Of course there’s the matter of Dobby wanting payment but Harry had enough money that paying Dobby shouldn’t be much of an issue and Dobby didn’t appear to want that much money anyway (asking Dumbledore to lower his wage to a galleon a week). I mean, plot wise a lot of things would’ve been easier for Harry with a servant that could perform magic that wizards couldn’t (like apparating in and out of Hogwarts so Harry could’ve summoned Dobby to the graveyard in GoF to take him away or have Dobby apparate him to Grimauld Place in  OotP when he needed to check on Sirius) so perhaps that’s one reason for Rowling not having Dobby become Harry’s servant",harrypotter,Why didn’t Dobby go work for Harry?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bgpvij/why_didnt_dobby_go_work_for_harry/,1556048317.0

Also, thanks to the person who messaged me (who wishes to remain anonymous) about the British ‘CPS’ system. And to the one person who downvoted me, I would like to know why! I spend a lot of time on these, and I want to improve. If these are garbage, please tell that they are, and how I can fix them! Oh, and this one doesn’t make much sense and is pretty short. Wonderful, I know.

*Mistakes I made from the last chapter:*
* Apparently you can start High-School in Britain at age eleven (birthday being before or on September 1st). That’s awesome, by the way.
* Guns can be effective against wizards.
* The CPS system in the 90s was awful and they rarely did anything. I’m glad it’s better now.

*Book:* Philosopher’s Stone, British Version

*Chapter:* 4, The Keeper of the Keys

*Synopsis:* The moment Harry Potter turns eleven, a large man by the name of Hagrid comes to rescue him from the Dursley’s. Here it is discovered that Harry is a wizard, destined to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ironically, in this world, he is famous, everyone knows his name. After the Dursley’s try and fail to keep him in the dark, Harry joins the half-giant to gather his school supplies.

*Reactions from u/Wither_Fire:*
* This chapter is the first time someone tells Harry that he looks like his father, but he has his fathers eyes. I’m starting a counter. COUNTER: 1
* This really is an exposition counter. But to a person who would have read this for the first time, fascinating!
* We learn of Hagrid’s backstory, and he hasn’t even gotten to the school yet. Wow, J.K. Rowling, already setting up Chamber of Secrets.
* Hagrid tries to turn Dudley into a pig, but only manages to put on a tail, saying that he already looked enough like one already. Harry said this a few chapters ago. The author is brilliant at this, giving each character a unique sentence describing their physical appearance. Umbridge is toad like, and Snape has a hooked nose. Trelawny is described by her glasses. Because of this description, when Harry sees the prophecy and recounts a faint image of a woman with large round glasses, we know it’s her. We later on instable know someone by a recurring physical trait. I don’t know if this makes sense or not to anyone else. Oh well (I’m bad at explaining things).
* Albus Dumbledore has many titles, one of them being ‘Supreme Mugwump’. Now, what the heck is that? Some sort of Supreme Chancellor (smiles in Sheev)?
* Hagrid keeps an owl in his pocket. Shouldn’t this count somehow as animal abuse?
* Harry gets his first cake! But in the book, it is spelled correctly.
* Hagrid mentions that Voldemort kills the McKinnons (Marlene McKinnon), the Bones (Susan and her mother), and the Prewetts. Wasn’t Molly Weasley’s madden name Prewett? Which makes her two twin brothers Prewetts, too. So Fabian (and the other one who I forgot the name, begins with a G) died by the hands of Voldemort. Also, on another note, she named Fred and George after the initials of her brothers.
* A lot of the dialogue in the movie matches up with the ones from the book here, in this chapter.
* I love how the letter Harry gets is labeled *The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea*. Wasn’t the hut in the Black Sea? Why wasn’t this more specific? Also, *The Floor*.",harrypotter,"Harry Potter Reread: Philosopher’s Stone: Chapter 4, The Keeper of the Keys",https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bgpf3y/harry_potter_reread_philosophers_stone_chapter_4/,1556045536.0

I know in DH book , Hermione mentions she read in one of the Horcrux books she acioed from Dumbledores office that once a soul is split it cant be put back together.

4892,AlexanderTheGreat30,1556042692,"     As we know Grindelwald acquired the Elder Wand after stealing it from Gregorovitch. He’s even seen running away and being chased as he had just stolen it in DH. But was he even the master of the wand? All wands (usually) have to be passed down by disarming or the original owner gifting the wand to you (like Hermione did to Harry) in order to have full control and connection between the wand and the wizard. It’s not killing or just simply stealing when they aren’t holding the wand (like how Harry took Bellatrix’s wand). Grindelwald stole the wand and ran away so if the rules apply, the wand shouldn’t be his.
     Of course this would mess up the future timeline because Grindelwald needed to own the wand in order for Dumbledore to own it and eventually Harry himself, but that’s when Ollivander comes into play. In DH he explains to Harry that wandlore is complex and the rules often seem to bend making it hard to understand. He practically admits that there are things about wands not even he knows and even goes as far as to say that disarming is the recommended way to acquire a wand but not the only. Just because it’s consistent doesn’t mean it’s the only way. Ollivander makes it clear to Harry that “the wand chooses the wizard”. What if Dumbledore was one of those rare exceptions where he didn’t need to disarm the owner of the Elder Wand in order to claim it, it just chose him.
     This would allow Grindelwald to never have truly owned the wand but the rest of the story to continue as it did. If this were true, then it would really speak about how great a wizard Grindelwald was in order to participate in the greatest duel ever with Dumbledore, and not even be the true owner of his wand.

TLDR at the bottom, cause it's a longer post than expected. 

Costumes
This was honestly the most annoyng part of the movie for me, I could understand them in the first movie since our beloved hufflepuff was trying to blend in with muggles, and maybe American wizards just dress normally, who knows.
But I just could not buy them in this movie, Albus Dumbledore dressing like a muggle? Muggles-hating purebloods dressing like muggles? FRENCH WIZARDS DRESSING LIKE MUDBLOODS? LESTRANGE WIZARDS DRESSING LIKE MUDBLOODS?
it was honestly the most distracting and annoying part of the movie for me.

Nagini
Why was this necessary? Maledictus are a cool concept: I like cruel inevitability in a character's destiny, but WHY NAGINI? Just give her another name she seems like a character that could be interesting if well done, but knowing she is the hateful snake that killed the riddle's mansion gardener and killed Snape AND served Voldemort just makes her automatically uninteresting for me.
Also she seems to hate purebloods but then she is fine being by voldemort's side? Does she loses her humanity when becoming a snake?

Credence
DUMBLEDORE'S BROTHER? REALLY? WHY?
The idea of him just being some powerful mage who could've been born out of a muggle family could have been so fascinating!
The fate of the entire magical world decided by the son of a muggle family? Such a powerful idea!
But no, he's part of one of the most famous wizard family in the world.
:(

The whole boat ordeal
Ok, this is just a gigantic plothole.
First of all the lestrange family, with branches all over Europe, and has houses and power all over the continent decide that most secure place for a full pureblood wizard is America with an HALFELF HYBRID, because of ONE boy who wants to kill him? Wtf?
Literally just gang up on the guy, kill him before he even finds out where you live, cast a fidelius spell on your hideout, put out a reward for his head!
So many different things could have been done and sending him away from their influence with an hybrid being definitely sounds stupid.
Then ON THE SAME BOAT there's a secret dumbledore heir which, by logic, is a fourth son of dumbledore's father, he seems to be much younger than dumbledore, maybe 6-7 years? Wasn't dumbledore's father AT AZKABAN AT THAT POINT? and even if he wasn't, we know he loved his family over any doubt, he literally gave up on his life over the anger he felt for what the muggle kids had done to Ariana, but he had a secret affair with someone and sent them to America BY BOAT? why not ANY OTHER MAGICAL MEANS?
This whole thing is so forced it completely ruined the twist that Tina was the one responsible for her brother death.

Fawkes
So let's just strip away one of the coolest thing that dumbledore had going for himself, being worthy of a fucking phoenix and let's just say it's a family heirloom, sure. 
Such a genious move. 
Congrats, I hate it. 

Hogwarts
How can you make hogwarts look... Boring? Maybe that's not the right word, but the place just looks so... Not magical.
It looked so.... Plain, how do you even manage to do that? I grew up with the books and the movies, and hogwarts always had this strange and whimsical aura, but in this movie? It just looks like a normal, boring school.


Let's talk about positives now


Queenie
I LOVED her arc in this movie.
She just wants to love whoever she wants, she just wants to be free, and Grindelwald ideas are so appealing to her from the get go.
She is obviously used to emphasise how manipulative Grindelwald really is, and how absurdly suffocating the rules of the magical world must be for someone like Queenie.
I think she may very well become an ""anti-snape"" type of character, turning evil because of love, instead of turning good,but I am really afraid that they're going to fuck this up and just make her redeem herself, which, in my opinion, would be the most boring ending to her arc.

Tina
She is a really interesting character, she is a Slytherin but not an evil person, granted she murdered her own baby brother but then she just sacrifices herself to save newt's brother (I can't remember his name sorry, so many characters in this movie!) , in the end they leave us with the doubt that her final ""I love you"" was directed to Newt, and I hate that, but generally her character left a good impression on me.

Newt
I think he's great honestly, I have a soft spot for these kind of quirky/weird characters, absolutely loved his interactions with his brother, but I don't think he got too much character development in this movie except for the ""I picked a side"" thing, which I don't think makes much sense, he obviously is against grindelwald ideas from the start of the movie.

Nicholas flamel
Loved him tbh, I was so happy he was being introduced as a character, and the idea that his immortality is not eternal youth got me laughing a bit.
He does prove to be a really powerful wizard by the end of the movie, and I hope he'll be important in future plots as well.

Jude law as Dumbledore
His acting was on point I think, thay just didn't give him much to work with, but I liked most scenes with him, although he doesn't seem to age at all between newt's generation and the present of the movie, which was a bit weird to me.

Grindelwald
I liked him.
He probably had the only remotely ""wizard-like"" costume, he came off as ruthless and manipulative and incredibly powerful.
Am I the only one who thought the eye make-up was weird? It was super distracting for me during the scenes he was in.

Fantastic beasts.
I mostly enjoied the CG (except the familiars in the ministry they looked remarkably fake) and most of the creatures looked interesting, even though they were not a big focus in the movie.
The big cat thingy was cute :)

I think that's all, that came out longer than I expected, thank you if you read all of that :D

I have read the Harry Potter series upwards of 50-60 times. Make no mistake - I enjoy the ride every time I do. Something about not only this story but the magic in Rowling’s writing gets me captivated every time.

BUT...

At this point, I can’t help but feel that every time I go to start again, as I’m reading through the first few books, it’s like fuck I’d love to fast forward to Goblet of Fire here. It’s not that I don’t love everything about all of the books. But I do find that as a knowledgeable, avid reading who knows (nearly) everything about the series, the first two and arguably three books can sometimes be painful to read. Not because the story or the plot is subpar. But because the initial three books were written, as you could argue they should be, to really focus on introducing the reader to this world. So every encounter - not just the first chapters, but late in the book as each area of Hogwarts is discovered - is written from the perspective that the reader knows nothing about it. For book one - absolutely valid. Books 2 and 3 unfortunately also do this, for some reason assuming that someone would either start the series out of order or that a returning reader needs a refresher. I find it a bit of a grind getting through these, particularly the first two.

But for some reason, I don’t have it in me to actually skip ahead. I feel like my reading won’t be authentic if I don’t read every book, so I force myself to get through them and not skip. Again, it’s not that I don’t enjoy the stories in these first few books, but find that as an experienced and knowledgeable reader and fan they are more difficult from this perspective.

Anyone else feel this way? Do you also have a mental problem with skipping ahead to maintain authenticity? Lol

4957,acerthorn,1556001998,"Quidditch is intentionally set up so that Harry can win the game single-handedly on his team's behalf. However, this comes at the expense of the rest of the players on his team seeming completely redundant. SuperCarlinBrothers had a video where they propose a minor overhaul of the game, but even their version of the game still takes away the narrative purpose of the game (that is ... that Harry can singlehandedly win the game for his team entirely on his own).

However, I have an idea for a single tweak - not even an overhaul, just a minor addition - that would have the best of both worlds. It would enable Harry to singlehandedly win the game for his team all by himself, but still cause the rest of the team to actually matter in-universe.

Think about other sports. There are indeed other sports that both have a time limit and decisive win condition. Usually, combat sports (such as boxing or MMA) fall into this category. Most fights are usually booked for a set number of rounds. However, the fight can end prematurely if one fighter scores one of a variety of decisive win conditions, like a submission in MMA or a technical knock-out in boxing. However, if neither fighter achieves a decisive win condition before the last round ends, then the winner of the fight is determined via points that are awarded by judges at the end of the each round.

That's a model that quidditch could have followed. Catching the snitch instantly ends the game and scores the seeker's team 150 points, but that only causes the game to end *prematurely.* The game is booked to a certain time limit, and if there is no snitch capture within the time limit, then the winners are the team who got the most quaffel goals.

This would enable Harry to singlehandedly win the game for his team entirely on his own (if he catches the snitch fast, then the quaffel goals don't matter), but at least in-universe, the other players actually make a tenth of a difference in the outcome of the game without sacrificing the importance of the seeker.

4965,acerthorn,1555992990,"I've noticed something about the train rides to Hogwarts in ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince."" Specifically, I've noticed some similarities and differences between the two, and I wonder if this was intentional on J.K. Rowling's part, and if she intended to convey some sort of thematic symbolism or something.

Both train rides involve Ron &amp; Hermoine leaving Harry behind because they have to attend prefect meetings, forcing Harry to find other people to keep him company on the train ride there. In both books, Harry chooses to sit with Ginny, Neville, and Luna, and then finds his conversation with them interrupted by potential romantic partners (Cho Chang and Romilda Vain, respectively).

However, the way these two scenes are handled from one book to the next couldn't be more dissimilar.

In Order of the Phoenix, Harry sits with Ginny, Luna, and Neville because he has no choice. This is the first time he met Luna and he finds her extremely awkward. Neville makes an ass out of himself with his magical plant that he got for his birthday, and just as the foursome are drenched in something that smells like poo ... BAM ... Cho Chang stumbles upon the carriage. Harry is extremely embarrassed, and wishes that Cho had noticed him hanging out with some popular kids who were laughing at his jokes.

Fast forward one year, and Harry is once again hanging out with Luna and Neville (Ginny was invited, but she agreed to meet with Dean, her boyfriend at the time, so she politely refused). Then he gets interrupted by Romilda Vain, not a woman he has a crush on, but a girl who has a crush on him. Despite having infinitely more self-confidence than Cho, and despite Luna and Neville both still being their awkward selves (as Rowling writes ... ""'You don’t have to sit with them,' she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville’s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl""), Harry point-blank refuses to part with them, telling her “'They’re friends of mine,' said Harry coldly."" Emphasis on the word ""coldly.""

I wonder if this is meant to show Harry's grown affection for Luna and Neville. Harry had always been friends with Neville, but he was never proud of being next to Neville whenever Neville made an ass of himself (as evidenced by his inner monologue in the equivalent scene in Order of the Phoenix). Meanwhile, he initially found Luna so damn awkward that he didn't even want to so much as be her friend. In Half-Blood Prince, possibly due in no small part to fighting alongside them in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Harry openly acknowledges them as friends with his head held high.

Has anyone else noticed that before now?",harrypotter,Train rides to Hogwarts in Books 5 and 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bgbxx0/train_rides_to_hogwarts_in_books_5_and_6/,1555964190.0
4967,Wither_Fire,1555989884,"Oh, you thought I’d given up? Have you? Well, not yet! No one corrected my mistakes yesterday, so I’m assuming that there were none and I’m moving on.

*Mistakes I made from the last chapter:* N/A

*Book:* Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, British Version

*Chapter:* 2, The Letters From No One

*Synopsis:* After finally breaking free from his long lasting punishment, Harry’s home from school for summer break. Dudley has already broken many presents, and Harry has to prepare for secondary school, Smeltings. However, for the first time in his life, he receives a *letter*. Mr. Dursley uses all the power in his hands to stop Harry from reading it, and all the ones that follow.

*Thoughts from u/Wither_Fire:*
* Dudley’s already broken half of his birthday presents and his racing bike. But what about his *gold watch*?
* Teacher at Harry’s school should have noticed at least by now that he’s being abused. Why hasn’t CPS (the British equivalent) gotten involved?!
* If Smeltings is an institution, wouldn’t Harry have to be tested? And since he’s normal, wouldn’t a teacher there have noticed and done something about it? What is the Dursley’s plan?
* Harry is savage here, and he is only ten. I never understood that joke about the head in the toilet until now. He’s saying that Dudley is stupid because his head is always down the toilet (right?). Does me not knowing this make me as dumb as Dudley? Maybe.
* How much money does Mr. Dursley even make? He’s sending his son to a private school, and buys him a gold watch. Petunia doesn’t work.
* Harry is ten years old (eleven by the end of the chapter). How is he already going to secondary school? Is it different in Britain?
* People blame Harry for not opening the letter in the hall, and even he admits that later. However, I would have done the same thing. I probably wouldn’t assume that my guardian would go psycho over a letter, either. But these are the Dursley’s, they are weird enough to buy their child a gold watch for his birthday.
* Mrs. Figg doesn’t like her cats as much anymore. The question is, did she even like them to begin with (see my chapter two notes for context)
* Mr. Dursley complains to the the mailman and the post office about the letters. How are they supposed to know about letters appearing in eggs?
* Mr. Dursley continues to go psycho here. He buys a gun. *A gun*. Now, there is nothing wrong with buying a gun, but what does he think it’s going to do against a group of wizards?
* I love how Harry counts on Dudley to know the days of the week, just based on television. That part always cracks me up.
* Imagine being the lady at the front desk. You receive dozens of letters all addressed to the same person. You confront the family, half of them obese and then that one skinny half-malnourished boy. He grabs out for them and then the obese man grabs them with a crazy look in his eyes.
* Yay! Harry turns eleven. These last two chapters have been super weird, and super interesting. Here, Harry is a regular boy. He comes home to 4 Privet Drive for school break, and gets ready to go to a new school. He dreams of going to a place without Dudley. He doesn’t have to deal with Voldemort or evil Défense Against the Dark Arts teachers. Part of me always wanted to see what would have happened if he attended Smeltings, made a few friends. What would he have grown up and done? I would totally read that. FanFiction writers!

4983,triforc3-mast3r,1555981743,"Perhaps I need to reread the books again, but to my understanding, Voldemort was able to create the horcruxes by killing people, which was explained as being an abomination against nature, thus splitting his soul, and then transferring that part of his soul into something else. My question comes in two parts then: how was he able, knowingly or otherwise, to create Harry as a horcrux, if the transfer of his soul is an intentional act? And if it can be done unintentionally, as is implied with Harry, why isn’t he creating horcruxes left and right whenever he kills anything, as he does frequent killings after creating Harry as a horcrux?",harrypotter,Question about horcruxes,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bga2a7/question_about_horcruxes/,1555952943.0
4985,Spinindyemon,1555980792,"Never understood Dumbledore’s reasoning for not telling Harry that Voldemort would try to send him fake visions to lure him into the Department of Mysteries which is why he had Snape teach Harry how to block his mind. I mean he knows that Harry hates Snape and vice versa thus he’ll have a hard time keeping himself cool (an essential in Occlumency). If Dumbledore wants Harry to apply himself in Occlumency, then he best way to do so is to give Harry a motive for learning, in this case making sure Voldemort doesn’t take advantage of their connection to invade Harry’s mind. Tell Harry that as long as the connection exists, Voldemort could use it to spy on Dumbledore and the Order which is why Dumbledore has been avoiding him all year or worse, Voldy May try to possess him as he was possessing Nagini at the time. Given how paranoid Harry was abt the possibility of Voldemort possessing him after witnessing the attack on Mr Weasley, no doubt Harry would’ve jumped on the chance of learning how to keep Voldemort from invading his mind if he knew that was the point of his Occlumency lessons. The Order members for some reason or other seem to be board with not telling Harry why he needs to learn Occlumency even though they know he’s stuck with Snape whom he despises and likely to be miserable. When Harry told Sirius and Lupin that Snape had stopped teaching him, at that point either one of them should’ve said “Voldemort is trying to lure you to the Department of Mysteries via fake visions to get you killed. That’s why we had you learning Occlumency!”",harrypotter,Why didn’t anyone tell Harry the reason for learning Occlumency?,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bg9wf4/why_didnt_anyone_tell_harry_the_reason_for/,1555951992.0

Problem is, you can't watch the bloody thing. The 1st task? Perfect, probably a really enjoyable viewing experience. 2nd task? Not only is it already pretty boring (especially compared to the other 2), but if you ain't a fish you can't even see Harry swim about. 3rd task? Even worse than the 2nd, cuz you don't even get to see some cool transformations n' stuff.
