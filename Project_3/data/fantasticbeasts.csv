6,Zivio104,1559566660,"Don't get me wrong I really like this series despite what some critics and fans are saying, there is just something that bothers me a little and that is that there is little to no suspense because we already know what happens.

In CoG there is this whole thing that Dumbledore can't fight Grindelwald because of a blood pact and that he says that Newt has to do it. But we ALREADY know that Dumbledore will fight Grindelwald eventually in the last movie. That battle is one of the things Dumbledore is most known for. We also already know that Dumbledore doesn't die because he dies in film 6 so the suspense that he may die is also destroyed. And about Grindelwald, you don't have this feeling that he might win, because you already know he doesn't. He literally gets defeated by Dumbledore in the last movie. When watching Infinity War for the first time, imagine already knowing that Thanos wins at the end... that destroys all suspense of the movie doesn't it? Well that's whats up with the Fantastic Beasts series. We already know the ending. And since the title is is literally called Fantastic Beasts and Newt is the protagonist, we also already can assume that Newt is still alive in chapter 5. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now we have the 3 main characters of the series that we already know will be safe the whole series in every situation possible, that includes the final film. And we already know that the big bad guy gets defeated. So we already now the outcomes of the main characters. So in every film there is not that little suspense that:  Will Grindelwald win? Will Dumbledore get defeated? because we already now the ending.

This is my first post on the Fantastic Beasts sub (my first post on _any_ Wizarding World sub, actually), and I just want to say that I love the Wizarding World and will forever be grateful to have found Harry Potter! I’ve met a handful of truly wonderful Potterheads on various other platforms, and I’m excited to get to know even more here on this sub! :)

Ok, but now on to the main point of my post…

So I don’t know how many of you are familiar with the YouTuber Seamus Gorman, but when I first started getting into YouTube a few years ago and starting discovering videos and channels involving some of my most favorite obsessions, his channel was one that I stumbled across and found very fascinating! (I don’t have a YouTube account, so I don’t subscribe to any channels, but if I did, his would be one of them).

Of the various subjects that Seamus focuses his videos on, the Wizarding World seemed to be one of his major topics. And I was impressed by the level of thought and dedication he poured into his videos, and obviously I loved his passion for the series!

But over the last few months, something about his videos has begun to turn me off. I feel like he has gotten lazy with his content and is now just making videos about whatever the latest trend on YouTube is, and saying and doing things just because he knows he’ll stir drama and get views. He’s also been one of those countless people to jump on the J.K. Rowling-hating bandwagon, and now, after this latest video from him, I’ve officially lost interest in his content.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci6aDAQStSo

There are still a few channels out there that I still greatly admire and respect the amount of effort they put into their content (shout out to SuperCarlinBrothers), and Seamus Gorman used to be one of them. But unfortunately he seems to have devolved into one of those click-baity, controversy-stirring YouTubers that are all too prevalent on the internet today.

I would love to hear others thoughts on this, if anyone else is familiar with this channel or any other media personality who you used to greatly admire but now feel has lost touch with their connection, dedication, and appreciation of a masterful artist and their beautiful works.",FantasticBeasts,"Seamus Gorman, long-time Potter fan and YouTuber, has officially lost my support",https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/br7fn0/seamus_gorman_longtime_potter_fan_and_youtuber/,1558395155.0
33,_davidrobertjones_,1557778496,"I'm new here, just watched the 2 movies last weekends several times, like 4 times the 2 movies in the last 3 days. 

I didn't like it at first, but now it's an obsession. I've got several theories.

I've been told that JKR confirmed that AD and GG were gays, but what I see is something different. I put the blame on the presence of Flamel and some light reading on alchemy, one of my favourite subjects. I know that this is entertainment, but it can be more, and my theory is that it is more. That the audience is reading it 'too literal'. One doesn't play with the figure of Nicholas Flamel in vain. 

What I've seen is that AD and GG have very similar personalities, and both oppose Scamander's. Fascinating triangle. 

GG is the grand deceiver. I liked very much how he's written as the great manipulator. How he was when played by Colin Farrell and then by Depp. Both did a great job.

AD manipulates too, but softer. He's the guy who always knows what the other person needs to hear, that he admires Newt because bla bla, and Leta, and Theseus. He's also a player. It's just that he's more subtle than GG. He doesn't risk that much.

Scamander, on the other hand, has an amazing talent to connect with all. That's why he's so good with beasts. He persuades. I adore the scene in which he seduces the Chinese dragon. Must say that I've never liked the actor before. He's done an amazing job here. 

Perhaps GG and AD are gays, but to me it goes beyond, it reaches their  nature and greed and ambition and power. They both have the same power, but play it differently. 

Am I the only one seeing symbolism in the characters, in sentences, ideas blah blah? 

Is there much different in the books?",FantasticBeasts,"Dumbledore And Grindelwald are not gays, but the same 'person'",https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/bo8kzm/dumbledore_and_grindelwald_are_not_gays_but_the/,1557749696.0
34,MetalVenomLudens,1557771647,"Some of the changes I wish I could edit in my cut of the film:

1. Since I've switched the opening scene to Credence's Rebirth, as we see floating baby Corvus, I'd want a voice-over of people chanting ""Return Great Avenger With Wings From The Water"", which would set up The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus at the very beginning, set up a mysterious thriller vibe and also convey effectively to the audience that pure-bloods take The Predictions very seriously. 

2. I've tried to cut down on the exposition as much as I can to ensure a proper flow of storytelling and wish I could do the same to Nagini's introduction. Imagine if Nagini's condition and origin formed a part of a natural conversation when Credence visits Nagini. They could speak about escaping to Indonesia where she is from and she could say something along the lines of I want to be free before her condition takes her and it would work far more effectively and also make us empathize with Nagini.

3. Keep the Parisian Garden scene with Queenie and Grindelwald, where we see Grindy take Queenie to a marriage and have the bride be the Red-Haired Witch maybe which would set her up visually before. This scene would be crucial in convincing Queenie and would definitely add to her character development. 

4. In the same Parisian Garden scene, have Queenie watch Grindelwald set a bird free. The bird flying will be a continuous shot which will culminate with the bird arriving on the rooftop where Credence is sitting during the Murmuration Deleted Scenes, all while Blood Pact plays in the ground. (Blood Pact playing in the background is a personal preference) 

5. Set up Matagots being Spirit Familiars and Guards of the French Ministry when Queenie first enters the Ministry, with a swirling shot that shows us the whole of Ministry, so you can cut down on the blatant exposition by Newt before Leta stupefies the Matagots.

6. Since most of Dumbledore's scenes are moved to the start of the movie, I still want him to have a presence in the plot. If you've seen my cut you'll know that I have intercut Credence and Nagini in the Alley, with Grindelwald using his Skull Hookah to inform his followers. When Grindlewald says ""he's desperate for family"", intercut Dumbledore walking by, setting up the Aurelius twist.

7. In the same scene when Gellert asks Krall, ""who represents the greatest threat to our cause?"", and just as Krall says ""Albus Dumbledore"", intercut it with footage of doing some genius work as we know he does in books (since Albus is barred from teaching, he's focusing on his own magical study). Maybe have him study the 12 uses of Dragon's Blood or something that might help destroy that Blood Pact, which will also organically set up Fantastic Beasts 3 and demonstrate Dumbledore's genius intellect. 

8. I've added the song La Vie En Rose to focus on the romantic relationships before Grindelwald""s rally, and during the Albus and Gellert parts, maybe show a flashback scene with them carving the Deathly Hallows symbol in Godric's Hollow, also maybe holding hands? 

9. Since the movie is called Crimes of Grindelwald, maybe show him STEALING the Elder Wand or some proper hint as to what his role was in Ariana's death.

Here are a few suggestions I came up with that I personally think could yield good results.

1) Make a Linear, focused, and clear story line: Lets face it, the second movie had quite a lot going on, too much for the majority of viewers. The next few movies each need to have a clear objective and point; leave minimal to zero room for the audience to potential get confused by whats happening on screen.

2) Trim the fat: An extension of my first suggestion, some of these characters will have to be put aside. Jacob, Nagini, Theseus, and Tina should not play key roles at least in the next movie. I like Jacob but his comedy relief Schick is starting to wane, a lot of movies sometimes fall into the trap of giving a side character more time than needed. Sometimes less is more.

3) Liven up the lore: While I am intrigued by the Dumbledore vs Grindelwald storyline and what it adds/can add the overall potter lore I feel that it's not being presented in an enticing enough way that can keep the general audience wanting to learn more. I also feel like there is an overreliance on having to tie everything back into the harry potter story, my main example of this is Credence potentially being a Dumbledore, it seems too contrived for my taste. I think these movies would be served better if they didn't lean so heavily into lore we already know. Create/expand new lore, explore the world, and have stand-alone adventure stories that can work on their own and but also loosely tie into the greater plot thats happening in the background.

My cut of the movie aims to do just that. Credence is given the focus he deserves, entire scenes have been recut and restructured and new footage from Behind The Scenes and Deleted Scenes has been reinserted into the movie to make it flow much better and make sense.

If you've already seen the original movie many times, you will notice that a lot of the scenes in my version have been restructured by taking them out of context to construct entirely new scenes. Some footage from the first Fantastic Beasts like dialogue has been reused to make character decisions make sense.

1. CREDENCE IS NOW CENTRAL TO THE PLOT INSTEAD OF BEING RELEGATED TO A MERE PLOT DEVICE.
2. QUEENIE IS CALLED OUT FOR BASICALLY ""DATE RAPING"" JACOB AND A GLIMPSE OF THE PARIS GARDEN SCENE HAS BEEN ADDED TO MAKE QUEENIE'S DECISION TO DEFECT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE.

Grindelwald's speech plays out like in the film (visions, killing curse, etc.). He senses Theseus and aurors' arrival and senses Travers' orders to arrest every member of the audience, Grindelwald tells his followers to flee and orders his acolytes (plus Grimson) to go to the Pere Lachaise to fend them off, showdown begins.

Two battles happen at the same time like in Infinity War: Battle of Wakanda (Pere Lachaise) and Team Iron Man vs Thanos in Titan (Lestrange Mausoleum) while Thor is prepping a weapon at Nidavellir (That one would be Flamel casting some sort of charm/spell to summon his allies like Eulalie Hicks).

Pere Lachaise: Theseus, Travers, Spielman, Arnold Guzman and Aurors vs Vinda Rosier, Krall, Abernathy, Grimson + Grindelwald's men.

Lestrange Mausoleum: Newt, Tina, Leta, Yusuf Kama vs Grindelwald.

Theseus and aurors defeat and capture some of Grindelwald's acolytes, Rosier and Grimson escapes and head straight to the Lestrange Mausoleum

Grindelwald defeats Newt and Co.,Theseus and Ministry arrives and got defeated as well. Choosing sides take place like in the film and blue flames. Flamel and allies arrive to rescue them, Leta survives and they all manage to escape the mausoleum. Wands to the earth happens and seal it.

Grindelwald doesn‘t kill those people himself in CoG. He lets his companions kill (the baby, ...).
We still don‘t know whether Leta has been killed or whatever.
Is Grindelwald unable to kill ANYONE because of the blood pact?

82,legooregon,1555432771," From the imagination of Wizarding World creator J.K. Rowling comes the Fantastic Beasts film series, magical adventures set before the time of Harry Potter. At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.

95,RedSiren2,1555014551,"Hi there :)

A small theory about Leta and later on Theseus relationship to their past … and how it might effect theirs not in a negative way… 

Enjoy :)


_______________________________________________________________________________________



**A little voice inside her head**

Throughout the second movie, Leta is haunted by a sort of vision of her little brother drowing … I believe it’s not just the chance of someone who potentially could have bonded with her in some way (despite Corvus’ influence) … but also great fear of having an own child.

I do believe she wanted a future with Theseus, and children… but was terrified of how she could never forget what had happened to her brother, and how responsible she felt.

I think Theseus didn’t know about her past … but maybe can relate to how she feels … since very likely, he carries guilt as well.


_________________________________________________________________________


**Man, myth... reject**

So far, we know that he saved the lives of muggles during WWI … but during war, one can never save every life  … and I’m pretty sure he has rather painfull feelings about being called a war “hero”.

Technically, he cannot be blamed either, since he only tried to help … but just like her, he may not be able to live with how he influenced who lived and died, although it may likely have happened anyway.

Considering this, the pasts and feelings they are battling with actually come very close - Leta was just a child that wanted to sleep, and Theseus a young man who wanted to protect people … and they both struggle.

Also, in almost 20 years of working as an auror, Theseus had to kill people in some situations … and I think it’s even more clear how he feels about this when he mentions to Newt how he doesn’t like to have a bounty hunter involved in the hunts mission either. He seems to feel, at this point, that sometimes there’s no other way to ensure the life and well-being of the majority, but it doesn’t feel right to him.

It’s actually something Tina may be able to relate to as well … in her case, we can only talk about 5-7 years of active law enforcement and no involvement in WWI, but there must have been some cases of self-defense etc. in her history as well … while Newt struggles with the unintentional death of the Sudanese girl he only tried to help … there are very well-placed parallels between the two couple’s traumata, it’s very interesting :) I really wonder if this is going to be brought up at some point … makes for a nice message of how it’s important and often very helpfull to talk about what weighs on you with people who know what it feels like. 

Getting back to topic, I believe Theseus would have liked tp have children as well, but on his part couldn’t live with the chance of them loving/looking up to him and not knowing about what he thinks he has done.


_______________________________________________________



**Shared pain **

I’d actually really like to see (if Leta should turn out to be alive) a storyline in which they reveal their respective burdens to each other - maybe even in relation to Leta having given birth to a child by the third movie - and realize on a deeper basis why they belong together. They see what the other considers his dark side, his unforgivable past - and accept it. Continuing their relationship with all masks off.

It's the accent"". So she wouldn't be able to read his mind and she would get to know him unless she actually talked to him. Another reason is that if Jacob ended up with her she would have to start from square one because he would have forgotten all of the magical world about her and how she met him.

**After Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was released in China, Grindelwald became very popular amongst Chinese fans. J.K. Rowling did not include much about Grindelwald in the Harry Potter series, so how did you create this character?**

First, I had to get the foundation right. Jo gave me many suggestions, and other than that, the most important part was just the screenplay. I made many notes on the script, and through reading the script multiple times, I slowly added flavour to the character. I didn’t want him to be a character that people could just take one look at him and understand him. He’s a master of manipulation who wants to convince people to join his side, and on the other hand, he does have softer, kinder parts to his personality. My take on him was that any internal conflict you had in yourself becomes very dangerous when dealing with Grindelwald. I think he has a double personality: one side of him is his original self, and the other is the side that tries to oppress - one clear, one mysterious. That’s also the reason why I chose to have different coloured eyes, to show the two sides to his personality. 

**The relationship between Grindelwald and Dumbledore is something that many of the fans pay particular attention to. Did the events that happened in their past have any influence on the way you created Grindelwald’s character? And did you film the “Mirror of Erised” scene together with Jude Law?**

No, when I got to set, Jude Law’s parts had already been shot. Jo has really written an amazing story, and she really showed how Grindelwald and Dumbledore’s love and at the same time, hate, for each other was built up. I think the two of them are a sort of surprising pairing. To each other, they are the best person in the world. I believe that there once was a passionate love between them, and this love was born because they both saw a reflection of themself in the other person. But for Grindelwald, his love came with an envy. He had always thought of himself as the greatest dark wizard, but in his heart, he clearly knows that Dumbledore has the same level of power that he does, and that Dumbledore will become even stronger. His conceitedness is eventually the reason why they went on different paths. 

From then on, Grindelwald harboured a grudge in his heart. But do you know what this grudge represents? There’s a side to his grudge that no one gets to know of - it’s wounds, it’s pain, and it’s this hatred that he has, having this, in a way, forbidden, love, yet having nowhere to vent his frustration. I understood Grindelwald and Dumbledore’s relationship from this point of view, and from some lines in the film, you can feel this paradoxical opposition between them, where they oppose each other like fire and water do, but yet are bound to each other. Grindelwald’s decision in the end was to continue on his path that led him to become the Grindelwald we know now. These are things that you can’t see on the surface of the story, because they’re all hidden within the tiny details. I think Grindelwald and Dumbledore’s past is filled with pain, so I also really want to know what exactly happened between them. 

**As we see in the movie, Dumbledore says that he cannot move against Grindelwald because they made a blood pact. If the blood pact did not exist, would Dumbledore be able to move against him?**

I believe even without the blood pact, Dumbledore would still be extremely hesitant whether he is able to move against Grindelwald. This is also Grindelwald’s internal conflict, because he isn’t sure if Dumbledore will one day return to his side. But I’m guessing he’s also somewhat anticipating the day when the two of them finally meet to fight, because Grindelwald needs this battle to happen in order to achieve his final goal. His hatred, envy and bitterness will all be let loose in that one battle. Grindelwald is very confident no one in the wizarding world can be a worthy opponent to him, because his name is his faith. But in the end, it will be this exact arrogance that will lead to his downfall.",FantasticBeasts,Johnny Depp talks about COG in a Chinese magazine,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/bb59bf/johnny_depp_talks_about_cog_in_a_chinese_magazine/,1554768260.0

It’s been shown that Leta was prone to dark magic, and infers later that Newt always can see the good in monsters. I think that Leta may have been in league with Grindewald and intentionally pushed the narrative that Credence wasn’t Corvus to further Grindewald’s goal of using Credence to kill Dumbledore. 

Why else would they show Grindewald’s minions placing the family tree there?

100,RedSiren2,1554684464,"Hey :)

After poking everyone with my previous C=G posts, I think it’s time to go over where and how this entire journey could have started - especially considering the prophecy we learned of.

Enjoy :)


_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Firstly: I’m almost 100% sure Credence real name is going to be **Anton** (first name in both Sweden and Germany), since Harry’s schoolmate’s name is Anthony, funnily, the name’s letters can be found in Porpentina … and yes, since Grindelwald calls the Chupacabra he uses and then throws out of the window after hugging and calling him needy “**Antonio**”.

And the name he was told by Grindelwald, Aurelius, simply translates to “golden one”.

That just for the beginning, now let’s go back to before his life even began.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Heritages and Calculus**


Since Linda Santiago (the actress of Credence’ aunt) is swedish (a country that the Durmstrang institut is possibly located in) and the Goldstein’s parents are, it seems so far, of jewish-german heritage (Durmstrang takes students from several countries - one is, of course, Bulgaria, but the school accepts german-speaking students as well), it is very possible that the magic one of said parents went to school there… and if we now calculate how Tina and Credence were born in 1901 and Grindelwald in 1883… we get a difference of around 18 years.

If we now assume that the Goldsteins married shortly after the magic one’s graduation, it would not only make perfect sense that they had their first child(ren) one year later - but also that one of the Goldsteins went to school with Grindelwald - perhaps even was in his grade.

So, if they had twins … what led them to sent one away to live with an aunt, one that visually would have easily been believed to be his mother - but resembles Tina a lot as well? A woman that has their Salamander eyes?

Maybe a certain propecy?


_______________________________________________________________________________



**Shadows of Durmstrang**


I believe that Grindelwald was not only spending his days at school researching the Deathly Hallows and eventually performing disturbing experiments with dark magic, but that he was also very interested in foretelling and prophecies - since he is a seer himself, it’s actually very likely that he came across the prophecy of the Great Avenger very earlily.

And I believe - he also had a vision.

One that showed him vaguely where the Great Avenger would come from… but I don’t really believe there actually were many candidates.


________________________________________________________________



**Where to turn**


I do think he considered the offspring of Corvus Lestrange IV to be the Great Avenger as well when he was born … but that this did not exclude other options, not even half-blood ones - especially not for a man as determined as Grindelwald.

It seems that it was a widely spread rumor when exactly the Avenger would be born … and that this eventually alarmed the newly wed Goldsteins.

They knew what Grindelwald was capable of, and that he would try and use their child to rise to power … so when their twins were born, they decided to sent their male baby away.

I know the Goldsteins were very loving parents, but I think they likely didn’t think their daughter would ever be a great avenger. It makes for an interesting connection to the line

“A son cruelly banished”

It was not cruelty that made them banish him, but not expect anything from their daughter. It’s sublte cruetly.

(and they still may have been mistaken …….. but that‘s really far ahead now)

So, they decided to sent him away to live with his aunt in the US and pretend this twin had died at birth - and never to tell their children. And after the shipwreck, whether or not the aunt survived, they thought their baby was dead.

I wonder if Grindelwald had a few visions around this time, either about what they would do or what the outcome woud be in 25 years … but either way, I believe that he knows the truth

According to Pottermore, he planned to use Credence against Dumbledore back in the first movie already … and telling him that he is a lost brother that was abandoned by his family is just setting him up right.

And how is Credence supposed to know he is being mislead once again?


___________________________________________________________________________



Anyway, that’s my theory. The Goldsteins knew Grindelwald, at least one of them likely in person, and were candidates to give birth to the great avenger. They had twins and decided to sent their son to safety - eventually, his trail was lost through Leta switching the babies, another dying in his place at the shipwreck, and the aunt only either having died or witnessed this.

I thought about splitting it into pieces, but wasn't really sure how to divvy it up, tbh. So much of this dynamic is intricately strung together, figuring out how to split it up started making me panic and overthink. I tried to be as thorough as possible, there are definitely some bits meant to refresh the reader's memory just in case it's been awhile since they've watched the film/read the books that could probably be cut. As well as pieces that require more explaining than I've been able to do, and for those I've provided sources for further reading if the reader is so inclined.

The post examines who exactly Credence is, the mysterious Aunt who was responsible for taking him to America, a look into the Albus/Gellert relationship, as well as the Grindelwald/Credence\\Aurelius relationship, a hypothesis on Credence's obscurus as well as why he's still alive at all, with a little tidbit about Queenie's role in all of this. 

**tl;dr:** **I believe Credence is Aurelius Dumbledore, on Percival’s side** rather than necessarily Kendra’s. Maybe full-blooded, if Kendra had sisters and Percival was into those kinda shenanigans. **Things are foggy re: whether or not Albus knows who he truly is.** I lean toward not. Partially because Grindelwald stands to hurt Albus so much more if he doesn’t know. If you want details for why I think this, read the post.

As for the blog itself, I dunno when any updates might happen. Tbh, I need a break from working on meta for a little while, but I'm open to requests if there's anything y'all want me to dig into.

Theseus could've had that badass moment in act 3, I'd rewrite that scene where Grindelwald's acolytes surround Newt, Tina and Leta, they get outmatched and have that moment where they look like they're about to die and the Theseus and aurors come to the rescue, puts up an entrance like Sirius in HP5 put up a good fight because come on, Rowling has been teasing he's a powerful auror but we didn't get to see that.

148,DCandMore,1553464451,"Considering the fact that I always hear from my friends, who also like the wizarding world franchise, about the parallels/similarities between the character of dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald and the real life Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, I always wonder about what Rowling can do with Grindelwald’s character, his story arc and the relationship between him and Dumbledore in the subsequent sequels that are yet to come.

I thought about it since Crimes of Grindelwald came out in cinema since November and I concluded what I would like to see happen, Grindelwald turns out to be this universe’s Hitler.

There are a few reasons I like this and why I think it would work:

1. JK Rowling has stated that the Fantastic Beasts films would be spanning about 19 years from 1926 to 1945, meaning the final film will not only end with the great duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald but also with the end of WW2. Considering the fact that no human has ever found out what happened to hitler after ww2, it would be explained that Grindelwald was finally sent to Azkaban for his crimes.

2. Grindelwald’s motives are truthfully explained in crimes of grindelwald. He simply wishes to prevent ww2 from ever happening. Despite this however, the war still happens as he foreshadowed at the rally. It would be powerful and compelling to see him realise the truth, that he has become the thing that he so wished to stop. His character development in the films can be down brilliantly if it was similarly to Walter White’s from Breaking Bad eg going from loving man caring for his family to one of the biggest drug leaders in history (or in Grindelwald’s case, from wizard revolutionist caring for his race to one of the most universally despised men in history).

Overall, I would really like to see this happen as it would be fun twist on common history but seeing it through the magical perspective. So I’m hoping for the ending in Fantastic Beasts 3 that he comes up with the alias of Hitler and maybe it also ends in 1939, so ww2 begins",FantasticBeasts,"A Fantastic Beasts theory I have, that I truly hope comes true",https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/b5243n/a_fantastic_beasts_theory_i_have_that_i_truly/,1553435651.0

He gets demoted from his head auror post after failing to capture Credence, messing up on Grindelwald's rally and having lose aurors on his watch. The ministry would take those losses seriously and they wouldn't let Theseus walk away from the setbacks which prompts them to demote him.

So where does his story go? I imagine it would be like Poe's arc from The Last Jedi.

1. Ministry gets a new replacement for Head Auror, someone by the books and stricter yet level headed/charismatic (I imagine someone like Lena Headey, Tom Hollander or Phoebe Waller-Bridge for the role).
2. Theseus, now demoted is tasked under the head auror's wing. They bicker and don't get along.
3. Having the ministry asked for assistance in Rio, they go there to help the government contain Grindelwald's emerging forces. They crossed paths with Newt and co. looking for an object that would destroy Dumbledore's blood pact.
4. With Grindelwald's forces overwhelming them, Theseus insist to continue fighting to give Newt more time to get the substance (from a beast) that would crush the blood pact and she's told that it would allow Dumbledore to face Grindelwald.
5. The head auror decides to stay and ask everyone to leave while she holds off Grindelwald's forces on her own and fights off Credence/Aurelius, Queenie, Rosier, etc. and sacrifices herself.
6. Theseus realise the importance of saving lives and working together, it would be a closure to what Dumbledore told him ""not to break up Grindelwald's rally.""

165,lucy_dal11,1553039480,"So bit of background, me and my sister saw the crimes of Grindleward and disappointed is an understatement. I thought the story was full of plot holes. The story was weird and nonsensical. And tbh don’t even get me started on the whole titanic thing or whatever that was. 

Due to our bad feelings towards the film but our love for everything HP we decided to re-write the plot. Let me know what you think. 

- firstly I would say maybe keep the prison escape part. I think it’s fairly useful in terms of plot setup I think maybe do it in more of a better way because it seemed a bit to easy to highjack that flying cart so maybe something to add a bit of drama. 

- next we again keep in newts trip to the ministry however, leta is not there. Newt is asked to joint the search for missing aurors and they need newts creatures to help find the missing people. Newt firstly rejects the offer and walks until his brother catches up and says that leta is actually missing can he please help him find her so he agrees to help.

- we can keep in the scene where newt goes home to his like zoo place. That’s fine and shows of the animals for a bit. 

- at this point newts like I’ll go to Paris with my brother but I have unfinished business first. So he goes to Hogwarts and we are introduced to Dumbledore (who teaches transfiguration). Newt explains leta is missing, newt talks about internal struggle because he doesn’t want creatures in danger and not himself in danger. Who will look after creatures if he gets captured to that sort of thing. Dumbledore is like I’ve got your back, if you need me here’s some kind of token that you can do something with and help will come (at this point maybe like a magic coin or something (like in HP OOTP when Hermione makes that magic coin for the DA)). 

- newt does some internal contemplation on the journey to Paris about his feelings for leta and also Tina. 

- side note: sorry any Jacob fans but the memory thing just was not working for me so that part was out.  

- newt arrives in Paris with his brother and a few other unnamed background aurors and go to the french ministry for magic to like check in or magical passport control whatever they have to do. Maybe the have like a little base or office there, I don’t know but you get the point. On newts arrival to the ministry he bumps into a distressed queenie who is in Paris looking for Tina because she’s missing. Newts like omg I will totally help because I’m already looking for some other people and Tina is a potential love interest. 

- so maybe at this point we will check back in with the big G himself Grindleward. He’s not up to much just killing muggles and plotting, and that sort of thing. Maybe committing some crimes as the title may suggest. 

- this part is maybe a little bit of searching and researching for the missing aurors supposedly caught by Grindleward (haven’t got a motive for this yet but I’m trying my hardest okay). 

- they then find Grindlewarda secret hiding place like hidden in central Paris somewhere, by the use of some random creature that has the ability to find them easily as it’s convenient for the plot. 

- team newt enter the like prison place or wherever they are being held captive and have a mini battle break out scene. 

- team finds leta and Tina have both been trapped together for a period of time and are now BFFs. Newt then is like more internal struggle as there’s a new love triangle (just for a bit of sauce and drama tbh). 

- newt and team then contact french aurors to let them know they have found Grindleward and they need back up to catch him again. 

- this then leads to Grindleward realising that he’s going to get capture and he then calls his followers to defend him. At this point we could have a bit of monologuing and explanation of motives etc. 

- then we start having a magical fight scene which I personally think we could have so much fun with. So I’m thinking all different people have fighting techniques (which they would anyway) some people can transfigure into like wolves and stuff and fight that way. Some wizards use like normal wand waving magic. Some use like wands still but maybe for alternative uses, such as levitating big objects into people. There could also be someone made some sort of potion bombs that are light hearted for example you throw one and it’s like a freezing potion and it turns into a mist and people can’t move for like a minute or something. So yeah just fun wizarding stuff like that. 
Side note: I did have the idea that we could have say newt, Tina and a french auror all shout a spell at the same time but because they all went to different school and speak different languages they all say a different word but for the same spell. Say for example expelliarmus and the same outcome happens but it’s a light hearted moment when you don’t know who actually disarmed the bad guy. 

- newt then is like oh well better call my pal Dumbledore he can help us. So Dumbledore comes to the fight and is like I will never fight Grindleward we agreed. Newts like I know but it’s really hard for me right now. So newt and Dumbledore devise a plan quickly. Dumbledore is going to distract Grindleward and newt is going to help all the good team escape. All the good aurors one by one get into newts suitcase and hangs around in there for a bit while Dumbledore and Grindleward have a face off. (Preferably in front of the Eiffel Tower for dramatic effect) 

- the two guys have a chat like I can’t believe you change, Miss you, blah blah blah. It’s gets a bit tense and they both draw their wands and are dueling (Harry and Voldemort styles). then newt gives the signal to Dumbledore. Dumbledore and Grindleward have a moment while dueling then we hear an disapparation crack, screen to black end of film (this implies that we don’t know who left first if it was Dumbledore protecting himself or Grindleward trying not to get caught) so a mini cliff hanger. 

- potential end of credit scene where newt opens the suitcase in his house in London and like 50 people get out majorly confused and some are french and that assistant lady that newt had is just making loads of tea and biscuits or something dorky and British. 

So yeah that’s what we decided. Might h e missed some bits out but what did you think?

I am not sure if I would claim this is a theory or just a random thought, but I am wondering if Tom Riddle (Voldemort) was a presence at all during Grindelwald’s reign. According to the timeline of the books, Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s epic battle takes place in 1945 (cue World War II tie ins), which would also be during Tom Riddle’s final year at Hogwarts. By this time in his life, he has already murdered his parents, released the Basilisk, and has even seduced the Grey Lady into revealing where she hid her mother’s diadem. 

Now, I am not saying that Tom Riddle would be a major player in the war, but I feel this would maybe explain how Tom would become acquainted with Nagini, whom we all saw lean to the side of good in Crimes of Grindelwald (which takes place in 1927). Dumbledore does not seem opposed to having his lieutenants gather at Hogwarts, which means that if Nagini remains fighting against Grindelwald, she would like be at Hogwarts on a somewhat regular basis, likely suffering from her curse of permanently turning into a snake. Tom Riddle, a parcel tongue, is also known to be manipulative and charming in his younger years and is head boy by 1945. 

I don’t believe Tom would be involved in any of the battles though because 1) Dumbledore “always saw through” Tom Riddle’s façade of being innocent and 2) when Voldemort confronts Grindelwald in the Deathly Hollows they don’t seem to have any history of meeting each other before. I am just wondering if we will be able to encounter a beta Voldemort in the final film.

P.S – I have seen a couple of threads mentioning theories of Voldemort being Nagini and Creedence’s lovechild. I am surprised this is even a theory since Voldemort’s origin (birth and parentage) was explained in the books and films so I am not including that in my curiosity of him appearing in the final FB movie.",FantasticBeasts,Will we see Tom Riddle in the final Fantastic Beasts movies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/b2qfhk/will_we_see_tom_riddle_in_the_final_fantastic/,1552926542.0
171,ShturenkovSergey,1552909078,"It has been twelve years since that terrible accident which took off my dear Stacey’s life. That evening I stayed at home with our son, Oscar. It happened when she was coming back from her parents, it was raining heavily, and visibility was nearly at a zero level. Getting dark is a quite early thing in our area. I do not even know if Stacey had a chance to survive. The car was completely burnt out after the collusion, identification was carried out by DNA. It took a lot of time for me to believe in what was going on. Too many coincidences, but even more pain and even more emptiness. Oscar was just a year and a half when she was gone. I thought we would come through it, but life had another point. The first month was just unendurable, it is hard to say where I took a power to live on. A dreadful depression and a lack of meaning in future existence killed me every single day. Every day I woke up and desired to die. I stayed alive only for him. Our little Oscar, a small piece of your soul.

I long for you to see him, he is a real genius. At the age of seven he painted a picture which took the first place at city’s competition of children’s drawings. When he was in the kindergarten I’ve already sent him to the art school to divert his mind from the tragedy somehow.

I’m writing this letter, and occasionally I feel a smile through tears on my face. After all, the achievements of our son are of our merit, too. I’m proud of him. When I finish writing my thoughts, I will have to hide this letter. After three days I will burn it alone with nature. I will burn out all my pain, as my psychoanalyst said. At least it should become much easier. I need to live further, Stacey. I can’t be like that anymore…

I put a pen aside and wiped the tears away. I had to conceal the letter on the top shelf of the bookcase. Nobody has peeked there for five years.

— Hi dad, I’m home. — Oscar shouted while entering the house. I should confess he had me over the barrel. — What has happened? — He understood I was remembering his mother again. My eyes didn’t have enough time to become dry. — Everything is alright, don’t mind it. Give me a couple of minutes. — I tried to avoid showing him my tribulations. He had suffered enough without maternal love.

— Imagine, I made a mess in a whole class today. I proved to my physics teacher that his task may be accomplished in two ways.

— You should spare his nerves, he is to teach a lot of generations a thing or two. — I softly made witticisms to divert from my thoughts.

— Don’t worry dad, I will substitute him if something happens.— And we laughed.

Oscar went to his room while I started making a dinner.The TV-set was broadcasting in the background, and I was in high spirits, what seemed strange. Firstly after all these years I felt myself good. Maybe it was because I saw our son being happy, or maybe my psychoanalyst’s task had an effect. It is hard to say, and there is no need to delve into these things, the main thing is that it is good for me and that the son comes home with a smile on his face.

I put lasagna into the oven and went upstairs to the first floor.

— May I come in? — I asked having knocked at the door.

—Yes, sure. — Oscar was sitting in front of the notebook, evidently, he was chatting with friends. Social networks, they are like the whole world for teenagers.

— Dinner will be made in twenty minutes, will you go downstairs?— I went up to the window and began to stare into the distance.

—O.K., I’ll just finish one deal.

—Listen, maybe we could repeat that evening? Remember, when we were watching ‘’Dreams behind the Wall’’ and discussing everything happening on the screen without carrying emotions.

—I'm only for it, I’ll search for something interesting right now. —Oscar lit up with a foretaste of the joint evening.

— I’ll wait for you downstairs, come down after all. — and I left him alone that he could calmly clear off his deals.

We had a bite and having put the dishes in the sink made ourselves comfortable on the couch. Flash drive has already been in the TV-set, we should only turn on the next masterpiece.

— What’s its name? — I asked with a great interest.

— ‘’The Dark Matter’’, something about universe. Rating is very high. — he began to conduct manipulations with the TV remote, and signature tune appeared on the screen.

\*\*\*

It was an incredible film, I declare. Some theories of eminent physicist of the whole world were at the heart of it. 

I won’t give you the bottom line, omit spoilers. But its idea turned out more attractive than a hackneyed title.

After watching we brewed tea and powwowed what we had seen. During the film we did not want to do it at all. The theme was too difficult and besides very interesting. Generally, Oscar and I were sitting in front of TV like two decent zombies.

— The core isn’t there. — son argued with me. — People made it by themselves having alienated collective mind from them. We hate each other and want to survive in this chaos. It’s impossible until every man for himself. People must understand that we should live for the sake of others. We will develop all fields of our science in leaps and bounds only together.But for now we’re just animals which can speak. Humans’ progress is at a very low level for now. — I was sitting with my mouth open having nothing to say. He was absolutely right.

— We’re just animals which can speak. — I repeated his words.

— Dad, are you okay? — he was looking at my face and snapping his fingers near the eyes.

— Oh, yeah. I buzzed for a while. Your thoughts are pretty well. I thought it’s much easier.

— All right, I'm going to bed, I am to get up at seven in the morning tomorrow. —he rinsed a cup out and went to his room.

After his words I couldn’t come to my senses for a quite long time. All telecasts seemed to be a primitive delusion which was entertaining slavers tired of routine.

I fell asleep wandering in my thoughts continuously leafing through channels. I had an output the next day, so I could afford to lie down at any time.

\*\*\*

Oscar went away so silently that he didn’t wake me up.He certainly does not want a sense of tact. I got up about twelve. My head was in such a state as if I didn’t sleep at all. Coffee, a shower, a morning walk. Coming to consciousness becomes more difficult with age.

I was walking in a high street then that terrible bell rang.

— Mr. Lionel? I’m a school pediatrician.

— Something happened to Oscar? —the ground started to slip away from under my feet.

—He’s alive, don’t worry. — the doctor falsely cleared his throat and continued. — Once a half of a year we take a sample from children and Oscar’s last results confused us a lot. Sir, we checked his data a lot of times, error is excluded. By and large, a rare breach is found in his DNA. Only seven people on the planet have it now. Our medicine is incapable of curing this. We don’t know the nature of phenomena like this. As practice shows, he has about six months left. I’m very sorry, Mr. Lionel. — my phone fell on asphalt, and I ran as fast as my legs could carry one. I was running till the forces ran out.

I was revived by some strangers, apparently I lost my consciousness because of overload.

— Are you okay, sir?—they were anxious about me. — Maybe we should call a doctor?

— No, there’s no need to. What time is it now?— I lost all track of it when I broke my phone.

—Twenty minutes past five. —they took me by the arms and helped to stand up.

— Thanks for help. Visibly, I lost my consciousness. Don’t worry, now I’ll reach my home. —staggering strongly I walked towards my street.

Oscar came home at about 7 p.m. I drank a half a glass of whiskey to take away the stress. I shouldn’t tell him about the disease. So it will be easier for him.

—Did you see the news? The whole world is chained to the screens. All channels transmit only one thing. —he turned on the TV-set not allowing me to say a word.

A slight tremor swept over the whole body.

«Unidentified flying object hovers above New York. For now it is hard to mention what it is, but experts from NASA persuade that it has come from a long space. They were observing it for a long time, but no one rushed to draw conclusions ahead of time. Strange creatures were registered by some CCTV cameras. They are obviously familiar with teleportation, because they easily appear and disappear in the remotest corners of the planet. Eyewitnesses do not carry their emotions. Aliens did not show aggression till now».

— Is that what, someone’s joke? — I glazed at my son.

— Hardly. Looks like extraterrestrial guests are exploring us. I heard they cannot talk. Communicate by some unintelligible sounds.

— The main point is that they are far away from us. I would not like to be in New York now.

—That's for sure. — Oscar slightly laughed.

About eleven the son went to sleep. And I prolonged watching news.

After a half of an hour I heard my son’s scream. Falling down the couch I ran to the first floor. The door was locked, and I kicked in the lock’s area with all my might. Breaking a part of doorjamb I rushed in.

An alien was holding my child’s head and scanning his brain with a dark blue laser.It is difficult to convey what happened next, but I calmed down only in a half of an hour.When I fell flat-out on the humanoid having brought my hands down to the bone. It has been lying motionless for nearly twenty minutes, and I was striking in his face in the heat of passion at the while. Having lost my vigor totally, I fell on my side. Son came to me and hugged me standing on his knees.

— Are you alright? — I had a strong shortness of breath.

— Everything’s okay, I was frightened only when I saw him. The rest of the time I was as if in my sleep.

After an hour we called an ambulance, and we were brought to the military hospital. Heaven only knows by what this unbidden guest could infect us. He was taken by some special services.

The next morning a head doctor went to me.

— I have two tidings for you, Mr. Lionel. The first one will please you much. Your son is completely cured. No flaws were detected in his DNA. But the other one…

— I hope it’s good news, too? — I glanced at the doctor, but he was obviously delaying the answer.

&gt;Dan Fogler: Spoilers.. you get fuckin’ toasted by… you get Blue Fire Toasted.

&gt;Zoe Kravitz: Leta Go Bye Bye.

&gt;Fogler: Leta Go Bye Bye. Did they give you any idea you’d come back as a ghost or something?

&gt;Kravitz: It seems very unclear.

&gt;Fogler: I want you to haunt Jacob or something. Like you’ve got something to tell from beyond the grave.

&gt;Kravitz: I’d love to do that. A little haunting action would be cool. I don’t know. It was, I think it was a **kind of a last minute change that she gets toasted.**

&gt;Fogler: They’re going to have to bring you back somehow. I think they’re gonna have to.

&gt;Kravitz: It’d be cool if they did, but if they don’t, that’s fine.

So...  Apparently Leta was not originally meant to have died.  To me this leads credence (no pun intended) to the theory that Leta is not really dead.  If JKR didn't plan to kill Leta, chances are she has plans for her in the future.

I wonder what Leta was originally meant to do in that scene.  Leave with the ""good guys"" or join Grindelwald?  My bet is on the latter.  I also wonder how late in the making of the film the change happened.  There is so much CGI in that scene they could have filmed the scene intending on having her cross over the flames and changed it in the CGI room to have the flames disintegrate her instead.  It would explain why her ""sacrifice"" doesn't really make sense (what prompted her to sacrifice herself at that moment exactly?), and why the Scamander brothers have a somewhat muted reaction to it.

No wonder they don't let fans see the original version of the script. 😂  With the bizarre ways they handled Leta, Queenie, and Credence's subplots, who the heck knows what was actually going on with the three of them?

Now this is where it gets tricky. Is water in this sense literal or metaphorical. If it’s literal maybe it could be retrieving the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the lake. That enables Harry and friends to defeat many of the Horcruxes, which in the end helps defeat Voldemort. 

If it’s in a metaphorical sense, take this expert from Google;

Water gives life to the body, the Living Water gives life to the soul. Water is not only a metaphor for life — it is also a metaphor for the One who gives eternal life. When God uses water as a metaphor for life — we need to be sure that we are drinking good, healthy life-giving water as God designed.

With wings from the water could metaphorically mean; avenging everything Voldemort does after “coming back to life”. 

This is a far out theory, I know. Hell, I don’t even buy my own theory to be honest. Just something fun I made up on the spot.

193,Mattholic,1552522366,"I'm approaching this idea from a primarily literary position. That is to say, the literary 'tells' underlying Aurelius's reveal seem to me to be far more inductively appealing than what can be deduced from the plot or the characters' motives thus far.

It has been noted by a few on here that Grindelwald could merely be using this supposed Dumbledorian identity as a means of further manipulating Credence/Aurelius into helping carry out Grindelwald's master plan. Indeed, there is no doubt in my own mind that this is precisely what Grindelwald is doing. However, manipulative though Grindelwald may be, I don't think he is lying. Rather, he is taking a piece of truth and morphing it to his narrative.

Purely when examining character motive, I think it is reasonable to suppose that Grindelwald, as a master manipulator, could have thought up a hundred different ways for seducing Credence, as well as fabricated any story he wished. To go as far as convincing Credence that Credence is Aurelius Dumbledore, however, immediately takes on the flavor of incredulity. Grindelwald would have to have something out of which he could seriously make that case, and I think this particular claim is not one that can be made without at least a shred of truth from which to weave the rest of his narrative. And it certainly can't be made by Jo Rowling through Grindelwald unless she has a great twist on how Grindelwald is able to weave such a story

As I mentioned, I want to approach this from a literary angle, moreso than an angle of character motive. So what are the literary tells for me? There are three:

1) The most obvious tell is that the reveal comes at the very end of the movie. When something like this happens and creates a major cliffhanger for the next movie, it is intended as a great setup that leads an even greater payoff in the next installment or series of installments--that is, IF the writer knows what they're doing. Jo has written the story, herself, and although she has shown a knack for coming up a sight bit short in the department of literary convention, she tends to hit the big notes well and in a way that drums up mystery without misleading anyone. I very seriously doubt that she would give us a reveal like this that ultimately leads to an empty payoff.

2) Aurelius's name starts with an 'A'. I don't think it would escape anyone's notice in the wizarding world (least of all Grindelwald's notice) that Percival and Kendra Dumbledore had a compulsion for naming their children with the first letter of the alphabet. However, while it would be entirely plausible for Grindelwald to be aware of this and take advantage of it for the sake of building credibility to the claim, I also know that Jo, herself, has an obsession with meaningul names. And since ""Aurelius"" gets a name packed full of meaning, not just in terms of etymology, but also with respect to Dumbledore family naming conventions, it seems to suggest, at least on the surface, that Jo is hinting to us that we should take this claim seriously.

3) Credence gets a phoenix--possibly. I say possibly because again, it's entirely plausible that this is something that Grindelwald thought up as part of his plan, and since Aurelius' place in the plan is to take out Dumbledore, the personal nature of the act might drive Grindelwald to create his narrative as intimately as he can, which might also include sharing the Dumbledore family legend with Credence and leaving him a phoenix to create the illusion of Dumbledorian heredity. But with that said, most (not all) of the time, I'm a fan of the principle of Occam's Razor. I believe the more you have to explain, and by extension, the more Grindelwald has to explain, the less likely it is that Grindelwald is merely pulling this out of his own metaphorical sorting hat.

As I've just touched upon, Jo is a stickler for meaningfulness in every character and artifact she places before her audience. And just as importantly, she loves tying stories together in interesting ways. So I think that yes, a phoenix really appeared to Credence. AND, if I may be allowed this one concession based on nothing but intuition, I believe the phoenix is Fawkes. For anybody who knows the HP books inside and outside, this claim might raise both eyebrows, as we know that Dumbledore at one point claimed to Harry that he was Fawkes's only owner. However, we can begin to surmise some things. During the events of ""Crimes"", Dumbledore does not yet have Fawkes. It would also be perfectly poetic that since ""Crimes"" is also not-so-subtly a Dumbledore origins movie, we will also learn about how Dumbledore came to be in the possession of Fawkes. Indeed, it seems that Dumbledore himself will be ""in need"", as the family legend requires, and we will find all along that Fawkes had found his way to the ""family"", however indirectly.

As a side note (and side theory), I'm going to go even further in saying that Jo may take this opportunity to indicate that the reason Dumbledore's Patronus charm takes the form of a Phoenix is not merely a result of his personality, but also of the outcome of the three-way struggle between Grindelwald, Credence/Aurelius, and himself, and of his subsequent inheritance of Fawkes.

We see numerous times in the HP stories that when something traumatic happens in a wizard's life, their patronus charm changes into an animal that represents someone they love dearly. Albus may not have known Aurelius well or at all, but I suspect that as soon as he was made aware of another sibling, he would have loved them with all his heart--especially in light of having lost a sister he regretted not showing enough love to. I know this is strictly speculative territory, but if it happens, I want to be able to say I called it. ;)

---------

There's a very obvious literary question that the revelation of Aurelius raises, which is: if Credence is truly Aurelius Dumbledore, how will Jo explain his total absence from the Harry Potter books? It seems to me that it can be explained one of two ways. On the one hand, it may come to pass that Aurelius's obscurus becomes too powerful and volatile for even the likes of Newton Scamander, who has experience with such entities, to manage. In such a case, Aurelius ultimately has to die.

On the other end, they may find some more benevolent means for saving Aurelius from himself, but doing so requires them to contain him somewhere magically. In either case, it seems that the utter darkness of the situation is something that most people involved will want to bury in the first place, and something that Dumbledore himself will want to prevent from becoming another blow to the family name. This might fit well with my patronus idea.

---------

And now we arrive at the 20th prophecy of the Predictions of Tycho Dodonus. Are you still with me? You are? Good. Let us retell this apocalyptic poem:

""A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter
Return, great avenger
With wings from the water""

If you remember, I claimed that I wanted to explore my theories from a literary position, and that is what I wish to do with this prophecy. It seems quite a few people think the prophecy may be about multiple subjects, just as the character Yusuf did when he assumed that Corvus was the banished son and himself, the great avenger. Now, it very well may be that multiple subjects are implicated, but not in the way I've seen it presented. If anything, the prophecy may have a double meaning, but ultimately, it is about one subject, and when you pay close attention to the clauses in the poem, I think the banished son and great avenger are one and the same. The prophecy is describing Aurelius Dumbledore.

In a poetic move, the spirit of lines alternates, with the first and third lines telling us what's happening while the second and fourth lines entreat us to contemplate the identity of the individual who is returning. And so we have:

""A son cruelly BANISHED...
...RETURN, great avenger""

In 1 and 3, we find that a son was banished cruelly, and now returns to avenge his own cruel exile.

In 2 and 4, we learn the peculiar circumstances of the avengers banishment and vengeance:

""Despair of the daughter""

This can be understood in one of two ways, or both, in the context of the preceding and succeeding lines. The line could be commanding the banished son to despair the daughter (presumably and logically, his sister), and/or it could be revealing to the reader that the banishment itself was the cause or result of the the daughter's despair. In all cases, this also potentially adds another dimension to the third line, which is that the banished son is not merely avenging himself, but also his sister, who was in despair.

""With wings from the water""

This can refer to something about the avenger's identity which has either already been revealed to audiences in some capacity, or is yet to be shown. Personally, I think it more likely the former. Remember that Aurelius was saved from the sinking ship battered by the seastorm. The line may very well refer to this event.

So if we take the prophecy to refer to Aurelius, then we have to explain its relevance. Suppose Aurelius was indeed ""cruelly"" banished. What would be the purpose? I suspect it has much to do with the despair of the daughter. In this proposition, that would be Arianna.

We can state fairly confidently a few things about Arianna at the time of her death and how it could pertain to an infant Aurelius. First, based on her explosive magical outbursts, one of which killed Kendra Dumbledore, it seems beyond doubt that Arianna was an Obscurial. Second, Dumbledore's suggestions about Grindelwald to Harry in the afterlife heavily implicate Grindelwald as the one who killed Arianna during his duel with Aberforth and Albus. Third, Dumbledore, by his own admission, absolutely despised taking care of his siblings at that time.

If we take these into consideration, I think this is how the prophecy unfolds:

Grindelwald killed Arianna, but unbeknownst to the Dumbledore brothers, her ""despair"", the obscurus, survived and attached itself to Aurelius. Usually, it is the Obscurus which eventually kills its host, but perhaps her sudden death created a window for it to leap to Aurelius another host. As Newt demonstrated, it is possible for the obscurus to outlive its host.

Stricken by the death of Arianna at the hands of his beloved partner, Grindelwald, and still fighting an unresolved hatred for his role as guardian over his siblings, Dumbledore sends Aurelius away, feeling he can no longer carry the burden of his family. Aberforth likely begrudgingly agrees because he, himself, is not capable of the task. Alternatively, Albus and Aberforth were aware of the Obscurus and felt that with being attached to their infant brother, it would do little harm now, especially if he was raised by a loving family and allowed a healthy outlet for his magical powers, instead of inheriting the Dumbledore family drama and reputation. Nevertheless, this was the combined result of Arianna's death and Albus's then-cold disdain for looking after his siblings, making Aurelius's departure a cruel banishment.

When on the ship to America, Aurelius is switched with Corvus by Leta, and as the ship goes down, Aurelius is saved by this choice. In time, he is allowed to return from his cruel banishment with wings from the water, who is Leta, her family crest being an open-winged raven. By being with her, he is saved from drowning, and by tracing the path of the family he thought was his to her, he is indirectly led to his true identity as the avenger.

But if Aurelius is the avenger, who then does he take his revenge upon? Grindelwald. Each line of the prophecy being understood in light of all the other lines, he must avenge the death of his sister and subsequent subjection to an obscurus, all caused by Grindelwald himself. If Grindelwald believes in the prophecy, he may strongly suspect that the prophecy pertains to Aurelius, but fails to see himself as the true object of Aurelius's prophesied revenge, instead seeing Dumbledore and even muggles as the objects of Aurelius's vengeance. It was Dumbledore who sent Aurelius away, and it was muggles whose attack on Arianna served as the catalyst for her Obscurus.

Of course, this raises another question. If prophecies are meant to be fulfilled (and we see in Harry Potter they are very much fulfilled, even if in defiance of expectation as to how), then how is Grindelwald still alive? I would say that for one, although vengeance usually portends murder, it need not be fulfilled through it. Two, there are magical things at play that may ultimately channel the prophecy through a paradox. In the same way Harry's unforeseen role as a horcrux presents as an unconventional channel for the fulfillment of Harry's prophecy, I suspect that Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's blood pact will come into play to do something similar. I just can't imagine how yet. But if the Harry Potter story formula is any indication, the prophecy involves the bad guy, and its fulfilled by severing an otherwise-unbreakable bond between the bad guy and the good guy (in this case Dumbledore).

It's interesting of course, that I haven't really considered Newt's role in all of this, but although Newt is the protagonist of these movies, it's pretty readily hinted at in ""Crimes"" that Newt is the shoulder we are happening to look over in the story of Dumbledore and Grindelwald because Newt happens to also be indispensable to Dumbledore.

---------

One last minor alternative theory:

The prophecy is indeed about Corvus, who was ""cruelly banished"" to death at sea, by his own sister, which became the source of her despair, and being a Lestrange whose family crest is an open-winged raven, will by some coincidence or source of magic return ""with wings"", ""from the water"" (wings possibly being a metaphorical double meaning for the swaddling wraps flowing around him as he sank in the sea). His return will mark the vengeance of his sister, who was killed at the hands of Grindelwald.

The problem I have with this theory, however, is twofold. In the first place, the movie seems to suggest pretty strongly that in the end, the prophecy was *not* about the Lestrange family, including Yusuf's misinterpretation, and that the Lestrange family tree showed Corvus as dead. As soon as this was established, the Lestrange issue took a backseat and it becomes obvious that Grindelwald manipulated Credence's search for his family as well as Yusuf's and later Newt's beliefs about the prophecy in order to isolate and seduce Credence through the loss of false hope, and reveal the more important truth in a way that would direct Credence's subsequent devastation at Dumbledore.

In the second place, Grindelwald lives, and since the plot's focus seems to remain on Credence, with an eye for the impending battle between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, it's hard to imagine how Corvus's place in the prophecy can take the front seat next to the Albus-Grindelwald-Aurelius trichotomy. Jo would also have a much harder time explaining why the role of Corvus was never mentioned in the recounting of the story of Grindelwald during Harry Potter's time. Such a scenario would lend itself much less credibly to the personal need of Dumbledore to conceal the transpiration of events, and therefore, I don't find it particularly interesting from a literary position.

So for me, Corvus is out of the picture and the Lestranges were not part of the prophecy, save that Leta was the ""Wings"" that returned the great avenger from the water.

However instead of Rowling’s reasoning that an “obscurial cannot be destroyed in obscurus form,” the small fragment of obscurus feebly makes its way back to the rubble of the New Salem Philanthropic Society. In the ashes of his former home, the ocscurus comes across a small chick in a pile of ashes in the rubble. After a moment. The chick moves in to the obscurus and the obscurus gently passes through the chick, like he does later with Nagini in the deleted scene Murmuration. The fiery light inside the obscurus begins to grow and soon credence is reborn in the ashes of his old home. But not only reborn, healed. The obscurus inside no longer is a secondary force but now a part of credence. He picks the chick up out of the ash and places it in his pocket. And begins his journey.

Upon returning from Rio, they open up an underground cafe for wizards in London… let’s simply for now call it “The Goldmine”. ( 💕)

Above, it’s still just a small bakery that also sells strange looking dough creatures, but once in a while, a customer pointendly asks Jacob where he has learned all of this.
In 1935, his response is “Paris” … it varies over the years, of course.

This word grants the asking wizards entrance through a small door in the sidestreet next to the bakery, and a wink from the little golden angel on it.

The stairs behind it lead to a cellar cafe, where they are greeted by Queenie and countless other wizards enjoying their lunch or coffee (or tea of course) and cake.

The Goldmine not only becomes to place to grow up in for a few certain children, but also a meeting spot for the leaque of extrodinariy ladies and gentlemen who can be seen on framed photos on the wall, next to pictures from city- and landcapes the US, England, France, Brazil and China etc. … and drawings of magical creatures.

I feel like this idea is even something that you could read out of the scene of Jacob and Queenie’s first meeting - they found that they both love to cook and bake, and to make people happy through this (Jacob’s words even when he talks to Newt a little later) - and, as aforementioned, it would provide the group with a proper meeting spot for the fourth and fifth movie, and the years between - a little like the room of requirement for the DA.

It would, in any way, be the perfect future for these two, and a great way to try and settle a little after all the adventures they had to go through so far.

208,Jtlock990,1552196798,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since I’ve learnt to read. I had the original Fantastic Beasts book when I was little and loved the first movie and Newt along with his fun companions. But everything changed when I saw the second installment, and even more when I saw so many people liking it and finding excuses to say it was good, even though it wasn’t. What worries me is that fans are so desperate to love anything Harry Potter, that they will accept any level of quality as “amazing,” leading to worse and worse stories and overall quality. I’m going to explain in little detail what I found wrong with the movie (since I could probably write a whole essay on it. Don’t have the motivation to do that right now) but would love hear any counter arguments (as shown in the movie) to them. 

To start off, the movie had bad storytelling and character interactions. For example, Queenie joining Grindelwald at the end, but Tina not showing emotion about it or mentioning it afterwards. Would a blood sister act this way when her only sister is joining a dark lord? No. Did Newt’s brother show much emotion after Leta died or mention it at all after? No. These characters died or left to the dark side and it wasn’t mentioned again. 

Then you have plot holes. The Mirror of Erised doesn’t show the past, the pensieve does. McGonagall as a teacher in hogwarts before her time. The fact that the last time Dumbledore saw Grindelwald, it was when they DUELED along with aberforth in a 3 way duel, so how did he make a blood pact before that?

Newt and Tina broke into the ministry like it was nothing, where is the security? Nagini somehow joins the heroes at the end. Why? Then you have Leta not going to find her family tree until the very end. If they knew it was so important, why didn’t they find it earlier? It makes no sense. 

All in all I think the movie was a disgrace to the Harry Potter universe and it was also not put together very well. It felt weak and unsatisfying.

The greek legend of Theseus also includes a philosophical paradoxon/question that makes an interesting connection to the character in Fantastic Beasts …

It is said that the greek heroes’ ship lay in a harbour for 100 years … during this time, all it’s original parts rotted away and were replaced - the question being:

**Is this Theseus’ ship any longer or not?**

Technically, it is his property, but not the actual one any more…

Looking at the character: we know that he used to be a rebel, so much so that he actively defied the ministry during WWI to go and save muggles … but in 1927, he has seen a lot and become very attached to the establishment … his original self has been rebuild, what broke over the years replaced … so one could say he still owns the ship of his person, but many parts are different now … although the end of the movie suggests that he finds himself and his rebellious side again (in my mind a big part of his storyline in this series) - and that he can become his old self again.

The screenplay left so many important details and even complicated the major characters like Dobby, but still, we loved everything about the films, the aura just got better. And now we are getting complete essence of J.k Rowling and people are just criticizing the new movie the Crimes of Grindelwald for its complicated plots. Well, listen up people, that's what she does, spellbound us with her story, weaving the story in a way that leaves us to wonder. The crimes of  Grindelwald is just not for muggles and if you are criticizing it then maybe you don't deserve the charm of J.k Rowling. The little things like how in the last book of the Harry Potter series like how Lupin was having the cold feet about the war and how eloquently make him do so,  it was just so effortlessly good but if it was in the movie it would have given more emotions to cry upon like every scene in the Crimes of Grindelwald which we can't afford to unsee.

I dont know if this has been discussed already or if someone else has already suggested this idea but I don't think Credence is a Dumbledore.


There's just no way no one ever mentioned him being Albus' brother in the HP novels. Also, why would Dumbledore's father and/or mother be in Africa heading to the US. I feel like if the Dumbledores were on the same ship that the Lestrange siblings were, they would've known.


Anyway my idea is that it's a Harry Potter parallel. It connects with the Ariana's-obscurial-is-in-Credence theory. Basically in the same way that Voldemort's soul was in Harry, Ariana's obscurial went to Credence. So if Grindelwald truly believes that Credence is a Dumbledore, then perhaps he sensed Ariana's obscurial, in the same way that the Sorting Hat sensed Voldemort's soul in Harry, thus sorting him to Slytherin. Also, in the same way that Harry got Voldemort's parseltongue with the snakes, Credence got Ariana's phoenix-magnet charms.

Jk has answered this one directly, when asked why Queenie didn’t realize Graves was actually Grindelwald, she answered “Occlumency”. Queenie is a natural Legilemens but Grindelwald is a highly skilled Occlumens, even Voldemort could not read his mind and according to Pottermore he was “The most gifted Legilemens the world has ever seen”.  I could be wrong, but I get the impression that Queenie’s ability is strong but untrained, it’s possible that she is unaware of Occlumency and a gifted Occlumens can not only protect their thoughts but mask the fact that they are doing so, perhaps even project different thoughts. Look at how Occlumency has been successfully used in Harry Potter:

Voldemort was unable to read Grindelwald’s mind

Snape concealed his allegiance from Voldemort 

Lupin concealed that Sirius was an animagus from Dumbledore and Snape

Barty Crouch Jr successfully convinced Dumbledore and Snape that he was Mad Eye Moody

Dumbledore insists that Slughorn must give his memory of Tom Riddle willingly because he is an Occlumens

Writing a novel isn't really something you ""cave"" into doing since it's such a massive, exhausting affair (I assume), so I'm not sure how this would happen. Maybe sometime over the next few years, Rowling will have a change of heart and decide she really wants to make these stories into books. Seems unlikely though.

&amp;#x200B;

But *man* it would be great to have full-fledged, detail-rich book versions. The plot would have so much more room to stretch out and things that don't seem to make sense would be much clearer. I think it would also help at the box office. Some people may not care about these movies about this random guy who isn't Harry Potter, but if there were new book installments in J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, I think more people would eat that up and come out to see the films. Having books to base the movies off of would probably benefit the plots too, as Yates would have a ton of scenes to pick from in composing the film.

&amp;#x200B;

257,DuppyLoLo,1551047751,"I’m of the belief that no one understands Wizarding World universe more than Rowling, its author and creator.  Film critics, casual fans, and even hardcore fans seem to be under the impression that they know better than Rowling and that she is failing this series and keep pointing to major “plot holes”, and I just don’t buy it. 

The plot hole gripes I see most often:

1.  ~Minerva McGonnagall shouldn’t be in the film, she was born in 1935~

This one seems to be the most pervasive. First off, the 1935 date is fanon not canon, an actual birth year has never been given in canon. Rather than copy-paste, here is an excellent article with a solid argument that McGonnagall is in fact much older and that it does not violate canon.

https://www.hypable.com/when-was-mcgonagall-born-age/


2.  ~At the end of the film Newt and Co should not have been able to apparate onto Hogwarts grounds~

The answer here is obvious. In the Harry Potter series Dumbledore is not only the sole exception to this rule but he is able to lift those restrictions as well:

“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.”

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.359

And

""As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed."" Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.544

It stands to reason that, as Dumbledore is the both the exception to the apparition rule and the executor of its enforcement, he created the rule himself after becoming headmaster, either in response to growing tensions in Grindelwald’s rise to power, as a result of an incident that we are not yet aware of, or due to the need for security during the First Wizarding War.

3.  ~Dumbledore was a transfiguration teacher, not Defense against the dark arts~

Here’s a forehead slapper. Dumbledore taught more than one subject in his history at Hogwarts. 
In Book 1 Quirrel is a returning, known professor at Hogwarts and yet it his first year teaching DADA, yet no one seems to have a problem with this. In Crimes of Grindelwald we witnessed the Ministry of Magic banning Dumbledore from the position of professor of DADA, so he changed subjects.

The other issue that comes up is that in Half Blood Prince we learn that Tom Riddle wanted to take over the position of DADA instructor from Galatea Merrythought, who taught at Hogwarts for nearly 50 years. Yet, we do not know that he was in that singular role for his entire tenure. Also, even if it is the only subject that he taught Dumbledore could have taken over for a spell (see what I did there?) due to a sabbatical, illness, vacation etc.. Remember that Hagrid only taught Care of Magical Creatures and yet this was temporarily taken over by Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.

4. ~Accio Niffler shouldn’t work, the spell does not work on living things~

While Accio shouldn’t work on a living thing it would work on the objects that the Niffler was carrying in its pouch: 

""'Accio' only works on inanimate objects. While people or creatures may be indirectly moved by 'Accio-ing'objects that they are wearing or holding, this carries all kinds of risks because of the likelihood of injury to the person or beast attached to an object travelling at close to the speed of light."" -Jk Rowling


This one seems more problematic at first because of the, I must say, fantastic jewelry store scene in the first film. Why didn’t Newt use the spell in that scene? Comic relief people! Haha. No really, I think there was more risk to the Niffler.  In the second film they are out in the open and there is no obstruction between them. Boom.

4. ~The Mirror Of Erised is supposed to show you what you most desire but for Dumbledore it seems to show him the past~

This one is simple, we’ve always known that the Mirror of Erised is multifunctional. Harry Potter Book 1, the mirror shows Harry that the Sorcerer’s Stone was in his pocket. He wasn’t seeing it because he desired to see it there, it was revealing to him a truth of which he was unaware. 

Also, Dumbledore is a bad ass wizard with incredible command of magic. Perhaps he just desired to see the past. 

5. ~Aurelius what? Dumbledore only had two siblings, Arianna and Aberforth~

I whole heartedly agree with you. Practically speaking the dates do not add up: Dumbledore's father, Percival, was sentenced to life in Azkaban when the three Dumbledore children were still very young. Dumbledore's mother, Kendra, died years later in 1899.

Credence is 18 years old in the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film, which makes his birth year either 1907 or 1908, it’s not possible. 

Why trust the word of Grindelwald, who’s entire character arch has been that of a liar and master manipulator? He definitely did not think that Credence was a Dumbledore in film one, when and how would he have learned this? What’s clear is that Grindelwald is grooming Credence to be his weapon against Dumbledore. 

Crimes of Grindelwald was largely about Credence seeking an identity; he begins at his weakest and most vulnerable state his purpose to find his identity, and ultimately Grindelwald empowers him by giving him a false identity through which he can enact Grindelwald’s purpose. It’s an allegory for how people are seduced by fascism. This whole series in fact is an allegory about danger of fascism and eugenics, so Jk Rowling. Consider that the story takes place between 1926-45 which mirrors the rise and fall of European fascism and we are following a tyrant who wants a special class of people to rule. 

As to whether there is a parcel of truth in his story.. it could be that the obscurus itself once lived in Arianna, so he’s a Dumbledore in a sense. Ariana means Silver in Welsh and Aurelius means Gold in Latin; we know that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were pursuing alchemical knowledge. My guess is that Grindelwald was somehow using alchemy to extract Ariana’s obscurus which lead to the confrontation that ultimately killed Ariana.

-

Personally, I’m over the moon that Rowling is writing the script. I imagine the knee jerk reaction by critics and fandom against this franchise is largely due to the fact that this is not a traditional film series, this is not Star Wars.  A master author who writes complex ring structured novels has the unprecedented position of having total control of the screenplays. This will end up being a very different movie series because of this, the films will play out like a novel with slower complex reveals that will break the Hollywood mold and upset people along the way, I think that’s s great thing. 

Personally, I’m stoked on the series. It has the fandom analyzing and theorizing in a way that hasn’t happened since the Harry Potter book series. We all know Jk Rowling can tell a great story, I can’t wait to see how this one plays out.

With the introduction of the Maledictus, Nagini, and the supposed brother to Albus Dumbledoor, Arelious. (AKA Credence). Is it possible that JKR is leading the way to The Dark Lord’s birth?

It makes sense to me on several counts. If something were to happen to Credence (the father) throughout the story arch of Fantastic beasts that results in his death, while Nagini (the mother)  gives birth to Tom before falling victim to her blood curse, it would be the perfect setting to leave orphaned Tom Riddle behind. 

Also it would make sense on the account of Tom being a parcel-tongue (a supposed ability from his mother, in addition to making her a horcrux). While bequeathing tremendous magical abilities that could come from the Dumbledoor bloodline (if Credence TRULY is related). Also follows suit with Tom being a mudblood, as he’s described in the books. 

Furthermore, if this is the case it sets up Tom to follow in Grindelwald’s footsteps. By wanting to rid the world of half bloods and muggles alike and believing in the ideology that pure blood wizards are superior. 

I could be mistaken but I don’t think Nagini has any magical abilities she is just victim to her blood curse. I’m sure there are holes in this theory, but just looking at those points could JKR be leading us to the birth and rise of Lord Voldemort?

&amp;#x200B;

The only conclusion I could come out with is that people were so into the books that they gave them a pass regardless how bad they were while since FB series are not novels and therefore does not have that novelty people openly blame it for not being childish enough.

&amp;#x200B;

The FB actors &amp; plots &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The HP actors &amp; plots. Now this is not all the actors fault per say, but rather HP series started with the idea that it would be the greatest wizarding confrontation ever and really did not live up to it compared to what we are seeing in FB.

 \- I mean HP, is just a regular wizard kid who gets to play hero because the villain chose him to be his rival. I mean Newt who most consider an average wizard with extraordinary mazoology skills would be running around HP at his best in Deathly Hallow.

 \- The said  Villain Voldermort is mainly a creepy guy who did shitty stuff and ruled via fear tactics compared to actually being a strong villain. Grindelwald in comparison is not only a stronger villain (both mentally and physically) but he actually makes you shudder on things he can do with his power compared to B grade villain Voldermort.

 \- We heard the Villain and his goons did alot of bad deeds but when you compare to their actual fights vs HP and the Order of Pheonix... well call it PG 13 ing it but really mainly shooting lots of stun spells at each other with a few notable exceptions who were using the AK spell, but when you compare it to people in FB were most go for kill spells in duels it really makes you wonder how strong they actually were. Maybe its cuz the HP series era things were mild down a nothc but you cant argue that FB era was the like Wild wild west of the wizarding era.

Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million years, yet only the last 4,000 have been of any significance. So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men, and rocks that came to life. So we called them 'gods' and 'demons,' and begged them to spare us and prayed for salvation.

In time, their numbers dwindled and our numbers rose. The world began to make more sense when there were less things to fear. Yet, the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.

Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, we must stand up for ourselves.

While the rest of mankind dwell in the light, we must stand in the darkness to combat it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane, normal world.

281,RedSiren2,1550597371,"Hi there :)

For a while now, we have known that the Acromantula Aragog, prior to coming into Hagrid’s possession, travelled to England as an egg, in the pockets of a traveller - almost certainly Newt’s suitcase.

Yet, something did not make sense from the start - why would an experienced magizoologist, the best in his field, probably at the peak of his sucess and establishment at 45/46, give a significantly large egg that he should recognize to a thirteen-year old boy?

Unless he experiences the classic mistake of being too secure in his own abilities that every human, especially those in high professions, is met with sooner or later, there may be another way …

JK Rowling stated that the next movie will take place in 1935, and I’m pretty sure this is also when Newt and Tina finally get together and marry/have their first child.

Now, said child may have a few friends … why not the son of Mr. Hagrid?

___________________________________________________________________________________________________


**Friends from the north**

We know that they used to live in the Forrest of Dean in England where Hagrid was born, but never learned what Mr. Hagrid was doing for a living … but since he fell in love with and married a giant, that might just be his expertise.

Who knows, maybe he even is/becomes friends with Newt, being kind of an outsider in the wizarding community as well due to his interest in the giant species (which is even heavier frowned upon than magical creatures, all the way into the 1990s).

I wouldn’t put it past that they start visiting each other and Newt’s child/ren, along with their cousins etc., quickly bond with young Hagrid, who is happy that they are friendlier to him than most kids (having grown up learning from their entire small family and alongside all kinds stranger creatures). Of course, he is at least seven years the senior of the oldest child, but I can see him as a gentle older brother figure :)

I can also see him getting along well with Newt - maybe this is exactly where his interest in magical creatures began?


__________________________________________________


**A brave little sibling**

Now, when Hagrid enters Hogwarts, the oldest child of Newt and Tina is at least 6 years old - and 7/8 around the time he is expelled… just the age to start making more or less thought-through decisions.

What if he or she learns that Hagrid is afraid of going back to Hogwarts after his father’s death, because his grief is still too strong?

What if the child cannot stand the thought of him being alone with this and steals an egg from Newt’s case or the hospital (maybe simply because it’s big), and somehow makes sure Hagrid doesn’t tell anyone (maybe sneaking a package into his Hogwarts luggage, signed with a Newt Scamander sigil?) ?

Who knows, maybe Newt had the idea of giving him a pet as well, though a more harmless one … which his child either didn’t know about or found out too late.

Either way, the truth eventually surfaces along with Hagrid’s expulsion, and I’m sure the poor child will be in great distress, thinking it is fully to blame for it. Yet I’m pretty sure noone will be mad at the child, since it only wanted Hagrid to be happy/not alone and was more than willing to break the rules for it - sounds like an excuse the Scamander parents would accept :)

It would be a cute story about friendship, and even a light in the story of how Hagrid was expelled … in the way that he could be used as a scrapegoat by Tom Riddle because of something latter would only find once and much later -  a true friend.

That scene changes a lot and I'm kind of pissed they didn't include it in the final cut. 
First of all, the way Dumbledore talks about grindelwald's vision doesn't make it clear if that ""vision"" talked about Dumbledore specificallAt or if that's just interpretation. 
Because in that case, we'd have another self-fulfilling prophecy on our hands. 

Not to mention it has potentially gigantic consequences for the whole Ariana thing. If grindelwald had that vision before the summer of 1899 or during (which must be the case if dumbledore knows about it), Ariana must have been the obvious candidate for the obscurial in his vision. I'm still pretty confident that her death was an accident, since I don't think albus or aberforth would lie about that to harry in deathly Hallows. But IF the vision left it up to interpretation if it was talking about Dumbledore or not, grindelwald might have thought it talked about someone else and he wanted to take them with him and Albus as they left to have her kill whatever man he thought the vision was talking about.

What if Arianna, through her misbehaving obscurus, got her hands on the Elder wand by defeating its previous owner? And Gellert and Albus knew this? What if the fight that broke out between them and Aberforth was over defeating or even killing Arianna to claim ownership of it? And in the heat of the battle someone did kill her and then, seizing the moment, Gellert grabbed the wand and ran. 

Now I know what you’re thinking. If Albus was the one that killed Arianna then the Elder wand wouldn’t have worked for Gellert all these years. But this is where the blood pact comes in. I think the blood pact is allowing the Elder wand to work for both of them. That’s why it isn’t resisting him like Voldemort. However, I think Albus knows that in a duel the Elder wand would not kill him and reveal that he was the one who killed Arianna and is the rightful owner of the wand.

330,RedSiren2,1549988014,"Hi there :)

This is a small theory on Abernathy’s part in TCOG and among Grindelwald’s followers in general - and I hope you forgive me for drifting into Aberbunty-shipping by the end XD Enjoy :)

__________________________________________________________________________


**The road**

By the beginning of TCOG, we learn that Abernathy is actually a follower of Grindelwald (perhaps even was during the incidents of NY). He helps him escape and can be seen getting the required skull for his visions with Rosier and among the rest of his higher-ranked henchmen, but more than once doesn’t look convinced of what he is doing … even nervous, frightened.

First of all, I think Grindelwald recruited him for a reason. Since he oversaw a department including the wand permit office and welcomed the european officials who would transfer Grindelwald to the old world, I’d say he’s the head of the MACUSA’s department for international magical cooperation.

Not only can Grindelwald use someone with experience in this field, but also bribe him with the promise of a high rank in his new world, maybe even becoming new president of magic of the USA… but not just that :) 


**A golden trophy**

We saw in the first movie that he is infatuated with Queenie - so perhaps Grindelwald promised him early on that he would, in a way, make this happen once the war was over? I’d say it would be in his own interest as well to have a legilimence among his followers, and, as we know, there are ways to jinx someone into agreeing to a relationship.

This could even lead to a comical scene in FB3, in which Queenie (who most likely rejected his (polite) advances in the years leading up to Rio, actually quite surely) confronts him about this plan, and about who could live with a jinxed partner, which earns her some eyebrows risen beyond the hairline from the rest of the group (although she has an out, she wasn’t going to keep the spell up permanently).

Anyway, concerning her aka her being one of the reasons, maybe even the greater one why he is a follower of Grindelwald, we can also go a little further …

We know he likes her type - I’d say a broad smile, specific facial features, a cheerful nature … my theory is that he, maybe even in the next movie, either meets or is told to get in contact with Newt’s assistant Bunty. 

_______________________________________________________________________


**The unexpected**

We don’t know if his tounge is still split by the next movie (which I wouldn’t put past, maybe Grindelwald conditioned him so much that he wears it proudly as a sacrifice for his master) but his muteness could be used to attempt draw her in using her compassion, and the fact that she has no problem with silence (having worked with animals) - and because of the beautiful large green eyes (a feature he shares with her prior crush) … I’m sure she’ll notice them :)

An so, eventually, something goes wrong - he starts falling for her and she, never having stepped from the loyalty to both Newt and Dumbledore, helps him to switch sides and eventually asks Newt to try and fix his tounge (which he agrees to do only for her, not having forgotten how Abernathy scolded Tina in 1926 (although he was only doing his job)).

Afterwards, I think his and Bunty’s kids could become friends with the ones from the rest of the group - but that is much further ahead :)

Anyway, what do you think? Anything to add?

334,DuppyLoLo,1549933636,"
As we have all pointed out here the timeline doesn’t fit for Credence to be a Dumbledore sibling. I don’t believe that Credence is a Dumbledore, I believe that he is being manipulated by Grindelwald to hate and ultimately fight Dumbledore.  

First, it’s important to remember that Grindelwald posing as Graves definitely did not think Credence was a Dumbledore in the first film and had basically used and disposed of him before Credence had revealed himself as the Obscurial. Notice the pheonix chick only comes into Credence’s possession immediately before Credence meets Grindelwald in Paris and that it only turns into a mature pheonix at the end of the film when Grindelwald, who shares a blood bond with Dumbledore and is gifted in transfiguration, handles the chick. 

One thing we know for sure is that JK Rowling is not a lazy writer, she weaves layers upon hidden layers only to be discovered upon future reading. Regarding Leta’s story of the swapped infants and the sunken ship. I believe that it’s too convenient that by happenstance a baby of the same age and of magical ability is across the hall from Corvus, Leta, and Irma. My theory is that Father Corvus, paranoid of Corvus Jr being targeted in transit by Yusuf Kama, sent a decoy baby with Leta and his servant Irma, basically painting a target on that baby while the real Corvus was across the hall. Once father Corvus heard that the baby across the hall, Corvus, drowned he no longer had use for the baby and it went up for adoption. It’s important to note that Yusuf Jana’s blood oath is intact, indicating that Corvus is still alive. Remember, the only “proof” of Corvus’ death is the family record which was stolen from the French Ministry of magic by Grindelwald’s Acolytes early in the film and likely manipulated to serve Grindelwald’s narrative.

But to go deeper, in Fantastic Beasts 1, Grindelwald tells Creedance that he is a squib, that he could smell it on him the first time he met him...  Grindelwald obviously has close connections with the LeStrange family, he held his rally in their tomb after all.. my belief is that Corvus was born along with a twin brother, and that Grindelwald identified one of the twins as a squib. Only Corvus Sr, Clarrise LeStrange, Irma, Grindelwald, and the “aunt” would know. Squib baby, being disposable, was used as decoy, Corvus across the hall. So the babies were double swapped and Leta essentially saved Corvus. Reading the script, Creedance’s aunt’s only line is: “Irma? They want us to put on life jackets!”, so Irma was on a first name with Creedance’s aunt. 

The prophecy of Tycho Dydonus which is referenced multiple times in the movie fits cleanly with this theory:

A son cruelly banished (Corvus/Creedance)

Despair of the daughter (Leta)

Return, great avenger
With wings from the water. (Corvus, who’s family emblem is a Raven and who’s name is literally Latin for Raven) 

-
A squib, although lacking magical ability, is still useful. But not to father LeStrange. My guess is that Grindelwald himself had Creedance placed in that magic hating household, to make him desperate and easily used later in life. That’s why Grindelwald, as Graves, had selected Creedance to identify the source of the obscurus, and why Leta appears to recognize Grindelwald in the crypt. 

Linda Santiago is the actress who played Credence’s aunt. We’ve heard that the next movie will feature Rio de Janeiro, I imagine her character will connect with Brazil. My guess is the Credence’s aunt is a Lestrange relative that lived in Brazil who was tasked with raising Corvus away from France and in secret. 

As to whether there is a parcel of truth in Grindelwald’s grand reveal.. My guess is that the obscurus itself is the same obscurus that lived in Ariana, so he’s a Dumbledore in a sense. Ariana means Silver in Welsh and Aurelius means Gold in Latin; we know that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were pursuing alchemical knowledge. My guess is that Grindelwald was somehow using alchemy to extract Ariana’s obscurus which lead to the confrontation that ultimately killed Ariana.

Magically speaking, we know Credence is nowhere powerful enough to kill Albus Dumbledore. Credence, in his genuine rage, couldn't even hurt that beast hunter who killed the half-elf nurse.

If Grindelwald was going for an emotional trauma/guilt-about-Ariana angle, that doesn't work either because, according to the interview of Yates, Dumbledore has no idea who Aurelius Dumbledore is.

So what on earth was Grindelwald planning to do? Show up at Hogwarts with Credence, do a 5-min powerpoint presentation about how Credence is indeed related to Dumbledore before ordering Credence to fight?

343,Sponge400,1549800723,"First thing I want to say the movie was absolutely fantastic. My jaw was dropped the entire time, I couldn’t contain myself. 

Next: after the first movie I think a lot of people were a little weary with the casting of Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. IMO holy shit did he do a damn good job. I mean seeing Voldemort just knowing that he was this full out dark wizard. Murdering and plotting terrible atrocities everywhere. Grindelwald however a dark wizard seems much more empathetic and strategic in his cause. He has a dark agenda, but is so convincing in holding onto what I would call “moral high ground” in his cause. He doesn’t murder for the sake of his own psychoticness. He does it when his cause is threatened. Which yes terrible, but not Voldemort level psychotic. I mean Voldemort murdered Pius during the battle of Hogwarts purely cause it seemed as though Pius was annoying him. I’d be lying to myself if I said Johnny Depp didn’t show Grindelwald perfectly. Truly impressive. 

Furthermore: Queenie pissed me off. She has no business siding with Grindelwald. (Don’t freak out she does. It makes sense I’m just mad that she did it. I feel bad for Tina)

Continued: idc what she does idc if the story doesn’t even line up. Fuck Nagini. I hate snakes especially that one. I’m being ignorant I recognize that but she can fuck off. 

Out of transitions: I find it really weird that in the Harry Potter movies Daniel Radcliffe’s acting could be described as kind of bland and lacking in emotion. I personally agree and disagree in some places. But I find it kind of funny that now Newt is an awkward sort of emotionless or emotion hiding character. Really no theory or correlation to each other but I think it’s kind of funny. 

Lastly: Does Newt have some sort of mental ailment that explains his sort of awkwardness and disconnection. He’s obviously a very interesting kind of person. I’m curious if anyone thinks he has some type of thing. I mean it wouldn’t be the first time JKR injected it into the story. Having the dementors be of creation of inspiration from her own bout with depression. Don’t freak out it’s an innocent question. I don’t mean to be insensitive or offend anybody.

By TCOG, we’re in 1927 … somewhere in early summer, I think (considering Newt’s book exhibition was in march and Tina had enough time to overcome her grief over his supposed engagement to date someone new ….it has been revealed that the next movie takes place in the 1930′s … and I’m pretty sure it’s 1933.

1. Newt and Tina met in summer 1926 - in 1933, they’ve known each other for almost seven years … if they likely get together in 1933, and marry in summer 1934, it took them exactly seven years to get from meeting to marriage.

2. The third movie could take place exactly ten years after Rio, in 1943, which would give us not only a new situation, all children and the story of how Aragog came into Hagrid’s possession (pockets of a traveller!!!), but also only two years until 1945, when the last movie takes place.

3. Between 1933 and 1945 lie (roughly) 12 years … enough time for the group to have the first set of children in 1934 and have a nice scene by the end of 1945 at King’s Cross, sending their offspring to Hogwarts :)

What do you think, could this work?

359,swirlywhirly356,1549243556,"As in, the entire Harry Potter fandom. I’m sorry, Harry Potter has always been dark, and I remain so confused as to why a huge contingency of casual and non-fans really hate that about it and want to insist that the franchise is really supposed to be “lighthearted and cute and colorful and fun.”

Um, it has occasional humor, but these stories have always been dramas. Not even dramedies. Dramas. And I remain confused as to why people hate that about it. 

This series has always relied on the sub genre of gothic fantasy and even fantasy horror. As much as any “whimsicality”, grit, darkness, tragedy, gravitas, and even terror are all hugely important to making the Wizarding World believable and what it is, and I think we’re finally reaching a point with the FB series where people just don’t like that. 

Listen; this is a series about World War 2 that is, in the words of a Rowling tweet, about a war between the magical and non-magical communities. It incorporates a character’s fairly tragic and dark backstory throughout. And the closer we get to World War 2, the darker it needs to get, because: 

1) That’s the most satisfying form of tonal progression and the gradient that allows the plot to thicken the most. As Katherine said, Rowling always finds a way to take her stories to a new level, and “there’s always an element of extreme darkness to these stories”. Extreme darkness. Meaning to the extent of occasional brutality and horror, not mere kid-friendly spookiness, and she’s right. Neutering the Fantastic Beasts stories to appease the Niffler-loving masses wont make the critical problem better, in fact, it’ll make it worse. 

2) You CANNOT write a film that has anything to do with World War 2 and pussyfoot around, make light of, or sugarcoat themes. You have to tackle them with balls if you’re going to even come near that arena

...so making an FB3+ that is “lighter and simpler” feels like they’re taking steps backwards, shying away from their dark themes, trying to please too wide an audience, and neutering the series. I’ll be furious if this release date push is really about them rewriting the trajectory of the series because they’re too afraid to be thematically bold and shocking anymore. 

In short, the creatives have caved to the demands of the contingent of people that always complain after the release of every goddamn Wizarding World story development that “the book/film was too darkkkk! Me want cuteness and sparkles! :3”

Listen, I’m glad you think Niffler’s are cute and all, but if your chief complaint is that the Fantastic Beasts series needs to “lighten up”, then I hate to break it to you, but this franchise isn’t for you. Sorry. There are legitimate grievances to have against the story and the film, but this isn’t one of them. Harry Potter is a dark series. If you don’t like that, stop reading the books and watching the films and demand they neuter and pink-wash them because they’re not “fun” enough for you. 

“Simpler” also holds potentially damaging connotations, because Harry Potter is literary. The Wizarding World is known for its complexity and subtext and theme. Make it too simple, and it becomes childish, dull, and uninspired. The Wizarding World isn’t Marvel. 

Look, I really hope that old “lighter and simpler” David Yates quote is preemptive and exaggerated, because if the subset of pussy reactionaries that can’t handle dark content has gotten to the creatives to the extent that we’re going to get progressively more joke-y, simplistic, and immature content, than y’all have seriously ruined it for me and for so many others. 

I almost feel like this has become a thing just because people are made that they can’t make excuses for their lack of investment or interest anymore. The Wizarding World as a brand developed for adult audiences coming off of the progressively more adult marketed Potter series, and the only excuse superficial fans and haters could make as to why they don’t take this series seriously was “because it’s for kids”. Well, that’s obviously not been the case since 2001/2002, and, with naked makeouts, infanticide, and self-mutilation plus many more instances of horrors occurring throughout the series since then, they changed their form of dismissal into constantly insisting that “Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts shouldn’t be so dark and adult because it is for kids”...look at the recent box office demographic breakdown for CoG by age. The Potter series has long been an adult oriented entertainment brand. We need to stop insisting that it isn’t.

393,thebosd,1548497378," I want your opinion on a cryptic (at least for me) line of FB2.   


The line in which Nicolas Flamel, when he meets Jacob in scene 86, says ""\[...\] I am an alchemist, and therefore immortal.""?  


What does that ""therefore"" stand for?  


I always thought that Flamel was the only known alchemist achieving immortality. I admit that I always expected that maybe he wasn't the only one to succeed. But the word ""therefore"" seems to imply that all alchemists are immortal. And that ""Cartesian"" tone, makes it look like a natural and obvious consequence.   
I don't know if Flamel is softly claiming to be the only real alchemist, as the only known creator of the Philosopher's Stone. Or if there is something more relevant going on.

And so I'm confused.

413,MetalVenomLudens,1548081447,"The movie has James Newton Howard's amazing score to its credit (Blood Pact especially), the noir aesthetics are gorgeous to look at and while yes, I do believe the movie's second act meanders a lot with a very contrived and convoluted French Ministry storyline there's so many scenes that do function on their own and serve their purpose really well:

Grindelwald's escape from MACUSA

Dumbledore's introduction (and that magic glove)

Newt in his basement

Queenie and Jacob's tiff on the streets of London

Circus Arcanus (minus the whole expository Nagini bits)

Dumbledore's interrogation at Hogwarts

Leta's flashback and childhood friendship with Newt

Mirror of Erised 

Salamander Eyes

Leta's Confession (though a little convoluted, it's very tragic in itself)

Grindelwald's speech at Pere Lachaise and Protego Diabolica

Wands into the Earth

Do you guys agree?! 

I'm not denying the movie's faults as it struggles to juggle a lot of characters and stories, the editing and the need to trim it to a 134 minute runtime butchers the flow of the story (second act is the biggest victim) and the very fact that they cut the Croissant scene which we will never see, but despite all this I don't think Crimes is anywhere close to a franchise killing disaster. It's merely a transitional piece and while a story should stand on its own with a definitive ending, the film does indeed leave us with a huge effing cliffhanger to ponder upon. I just think the shortcomings of its story's flow make the incomplete nature of the story much more apparent.

In the upcoming movies they should start showing him killing/manipulating important muggle officials, orchestrating magical terrorists attacks, really getting into the whole ""expose the magical world"" aspect of his agenda. 

It can't just be wizards that know about Grindelwald and want to stop him, so we should be introduced to muggles who also want to take him down as well. The first movie kinda touched on the fact that there are some muggles(like the second Salem group) who know about and hate magic and want to exterminate wizards, thats a plot thread that should start showing up more throughout these movies.

If he was Kendra's son by Marvolo (lol), he wouldn't have been a Dumbledore. Kendra wasn't a Dumbledore by blood.
If he was Percival's son by Mrs Gaunt, then he wouldn't have been a Gaunt. Even if we assume Mrs Gaunt was her husband's paternal parallel cousin or even his sister, and thus a Gaunt by blood, I don't see how she could have had a child older than Merope by an imprisoned man.

441,DuppyLoLo,1547686115,"Reading the script, I found the handful of real world locations that Rowling mentioned to be interesting and likely very intentional. I thought I’d share. 

St. Paul’s Cathedral- 

Where Newt first meets up with Dumbledore on the rooftop. This one jumped out at me. St Paul’s Cathedral was built on Roman ruins of a temple of Diana, the Goddess of wild animals! It’s also a notable location in WW2 as it miraculously survived the Battle of London with little damage as the neighborhood around it was leveled. I wonder if we will see a major battle take place here? Perhaps a protective spell cast over it? Also notable is that famously bells were sounded from St. Paul’s to celebrate liberation of France and later the end of the European war. 

Trafalgar Square-

As Newt and Dumbledore walk together through the fog and Newt questions Dumbledore’s intentions for sending him to New York they pass through Trafalgar Square. There is a major landmark in Trafalgar Square: the Landeer Lions surrounding Nelson’s Column. The Landseer Lions are four lions surrounding Nelson’s column, obviously another parallel to Newt and wild animals. The column itself has Horatio Nelson standing on top. Trafalgar Square was historically a site of a major game changing battle in which under Nelson’s command Napoleon was defeated and prevented from invading the homeland. Perhaps this is an allusion to Newt’s ultimate role in the coming battle with Grindelwald, to support Dumbledore.

Cliffs of Dover- 

Where Newt and Jacob take the bucket Portkey. 
We know Rowling is a big Shakespeare fan, Hermoine’s name comes directly from Shakespeare after all. The cliffs of Dover feature  prominently in King Lear and are ment to represent the boundary between the known and unknown, a poignant metaphor as Newt travels to France in search of Tina. Also interesting, you can see France from the cliffs.

Place De Furstenberg-

Where the French Ministry resides. I know the least about this one but historically this area was a monastery complex turned gunpowder/arms depot during the French Revolution. In the late 1800s on it become a famous haunt for intellectuals and artists, social oddballs. It feels natural that the wizard community would set up here. 

51 rue de Montmorency-

The house of Nicolas Flamel.  Literally the Nicolas Flamel house, or Maison de Nicolas Flamel. 

Anyway, I found this interesting! I hope you do too

481,leepLethora,1547010145,"So that everyone understand first off we must remember that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to change allegiance, Grindelwald stunned Gregoravich while he had the wand. Either the stunning spell made the allegiance change or the stealing did, both show that the original owner doesn't need to be in possession of it. 
This is also true of Harry forcing Draco's wand off him, the elder wand being in Dumbledores tomb at the time which was in allegiance of Draco at that point, which then changes allegiance to Harry.

What I believe is that Newt is now the true owner after defeating grindelwald in the subway with his pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below:

""With a sense that he’s been holding this one back, he slashes it through the air: out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around GRAVES like a whip. GRAVES tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers, struggles and falls to his knees, dropping his wand.""

This would be a clear act of defeating Grindelwald, bound and disarmed, regardless if Grindelwald dropped it of his own accord, if he did then it's a sign of giving up and defeat more so then it being ""disarmed"" from him.

Grindelwald will be able to use the wand as normal when he receives it back but it will not act like an unbeatable wand for him. 

With the knowledge of the last movie having the blood pact and the theory that they cannot harm eachother which leads to the theory of Arianas death being a spell rebounding off one of them then hitting her instead due to the blood pact not letting them harm eachother (this is from another theory of how the blood pact works by not allowing them to hit eachother with spells which ties in with how a spell would of ricocheted and hit ariana instead), the same may happen again. 

Dumbledore may send a disarming spell and it rebounds off Grindelwald and hits Newt without meaning to which would then cause Dumbledore to be the true owner, then recognising that it's now attacking his master, causes the next spell that Grindelwald casts to rebound back at Grindelwald which does not go against the conditions of the bloodpact, which then defeats him, possibly a disarming spell since Grindelwald doesn't die which then causes the wand to fly up and Dumbledore then takes possession of and ultimately defeats Grindelwald.

I'm of the mind that Percival perished in Azkaban well before Kendra died so I don't really see how he could have had another child, whether by Kendra or by another woman, around 1899-1901.

Although the Credence's-Obscurus-is-Ariana's theory sounded really silly to me at first, and still kinda does, I hope it turns out to be true. I really just want the Dumbledore family to remain as it is; there's no need for a bastard half brother.

Anyway, if Credence does turn out to be just a figurative brother or not a brother at all, which family do you all think he'll belong to? One we've already heard of? Will he somehow end up being revealed to be Corvus Lestrange despite what went down in CoG? Will he be a nobody?

Is Harry Potter a Dumbledore?

I think Harry Potter will be a Dumbledore.

Seriously.  I think Creedence will actually be a Dumbledore and Lilly will be a  descendant from him. That is why Lilly could use the ancient magic to  protect Harry. That is why the Phoenix burns when Harry first sees it,  and why it comes to his aid when he is in trouble. That is why  Dumbledore acts like a father to Harry.

JK  have shown that she wants to tie the old and new stories together and  doesn't mind changing things along the way. She has also dropped hints  of future twists early on.

I'll try to save the best for last.


1. So mogonagal(apologies if it's spelt wrong)...I've seen some statements for this one that makes it eligible for her to be there at this time so I'm not going to dwell to much on this one

2. How could queenie (although he's all powerful)  not be able to read grindelwalds intentions? 


3.Everyday I'm nifflein,  correct me if I'm wrong but was one of the main points in Fb 1 that he couldn't just acio niffler when he was in helping himself to all the goodies in the bank....yet in the second movie he can do it no problem :/.

4. À là strange...I could have a few errors in this one BUT this whole end of the lestrabge bloodline business.... Yet does bellatrix not end up with rudolphus lestrange (married)....tare me apart for all my errors in that sentence lol

5. One of the main ones and probably the most interesting is one I read on someone else's page...(Deathly hallows, wand doesn't answer to the big V because harry disarmed draco so technically it belonged to him bla bla bla)...what I seen someone point out, did Tina not disarm graves in the first movie? So technically going by 10 years worth of movies, does it not answer to her now?



Feel free to point out my many errors but just wanted to start a discussion on a few points I was unclear about...anything to take my mind off the whole credence conundrum... 
Which I've the answer to but I'll leave that for my other thread lol

493,johncg_1,1546742041,"To get it out of the way, I did thoroughly enjoy CoG and I am a die-hard HP/FB/Wizarding World fan. There is no doubt about that. 
However, it is irritating that we have been left in the dark with quite a few details in the most recent installment. Instead of continuing the storyline and solidifying our view of the WW and these new characters, it seems to have created more questions and confusion. It pains me to see fans (casual and hardcore) drifting away from JKR's writing and dismissing her most recent developments on expanding the WW. I wish she would publish more clarifying articles on Pottermore to smooth out the confusion, just to get us to the next film in peace (because I do believe at the end of the series everything will make sense). Instead of these useless facts about Wizards shitting themselves 😔. 
CoG was clearly a set up to a new direction with the FB franchise. The first film being an intro to a new Wizarding World dynamic with new characters, the second introducing/setting up the new storyline for this franchise. I do wish that FB was a stand alone film, just how the book is a mini-spinoff (focusing a lot less on Grindelwald, maybe just keeping it as something happening in the background to get our little nerdy minds going crazy). To get us riled up for a new trilogy (seperate from the FB spinoff). Kind of like how Rogue One or Solo is to Star Wars. I love Newt (I identify with him the most out of all HP/FB characters) and the Magical Creatures are my favourite part of the WW. But he seems forced into the Grindelwald storyline, and his character development and our education about the Beasts suffers because of this bigger storyline consuming them. I did enjoy the fact that in CoG they did maintain the neat new creatures, but it just seems forced.
I am happy that we are getting new WW films and expanding this awesome universe, so I can't complain too much. I am well aware that there is a whole different business side to this. But in my idealistic world that is how I feel things should have gone. I also think that is why people feel like it has turned into a money grab. I truly don't think that is the case though. I just think it is JK battling with the money side and the true creative side of things, and unfortunately it has made things a little messy. 
Anyone agree, or have thoughts on my thoughts? I know it isn't necessarily a hot new take on things. But it has been on my mind for awhile, and seeing a lot of off-the-cuff negative comments about our beloved Wizarding World has made me want to share my thoughts amongst fellow fans.
If this post was pointless to you, I apologize. So I will leave you with this (possibly) more interesting outcome for Queenie at the end of CoG, to make it worth your while 😁
So it's a semi-minor change and I will set it up with this statement: I am not a huge fan of Jacob's character being such a big focus in CoG I think he could have been left behind in FB and maybe a small little cameo in CoG might have been cute, but nothing more. Having a No-Maj taking up so much screentime frustrates me because I want to see more magical stuff going on. I have spent my whole life as a frustrated No-Maj and it's not what draws me to the WW haha idk just my opinion. So I think it would have been a lot more dramatic and impactful (maybe a bit morbid) if Queenie and Jacob both ran through the fire at Grindelwald's rally. Both of them truly believing that Grindelwald was a revolutionary with great ideas. Then as they run through Jacob is consumed by the fire, while Queenie makes it to the otherside. Thus creating a much more sinister moment (emotionally) driving the evilness of Grindelwald. Then, not sure how specifically, Grindelwald still persuades Queenie to be by his side (to utilize her mind reading power) then we see Queenie turn a complete 180° into a more sinister corrupted character. I think it would be better this way because:
1) the scene would be a bit more powerful to the audience imo. Seeing a strong romance come to a bitter end
2) Seeing Queenie transform into a truly dark character would be fascinating to watch. And the struggle between her and Tina could be heartwrenching and dramatic. Or maybe seeing her become dark then return to her senses and start being resentful towards Grindelwald and become a double agent for Dumbledore (a la Snape)
3) We would see a definite end to Jacob's character (providing more screen time to more dynamic characters to this complex plot) while still having a sentimental connection to the story.

But ya that is the only thing I would have changed in CoG. Not mad about the actual outcome, just thought it would be a more intense change. Even though there are some holes in the unfolding plot, I am not worthy to question or alter JKs writing. I do believe she has written everything the way it is supposed to be and it will make sense in the grand scheme of things. Excited to see where this journey takes us. For those of you who made it this far into my ramblings, thank you for your time and I would love to hear your opinions on the matter.

  Personally, I don’t believe that Creedance is a Dumbledore at all, I believe that he is being manipulated by Grindelwald to hate and ultimately fight Dumbledore. Notice the pheonix chick only comes into Creedance’s possession immediately before Creedance meets Grindelwald in Paris, and that it only turns into a mature pheonix when Grindelwald, who shares a blood bond with Dumbledore, handles the chick. 

One thing we know for sure is that JK Rowling is not a lazy writer, she weaves layers upon hidden layers only to be discovered upon future reading. I believe that it’s too convenient that a baby of the same age and of magical ability is across the hall from Corvus and family. My theory is that Father Corvus, paranoid of Corvus Jr being targeted in transit, sent a decoy baby with Leta and Irma basically painting a target on that baby while the real Corvus was across the hall. Once father Corvus heard that the baby across the hall, Corvus, drowned he no longer had use for the baby and it went up for adoption. 

But to go deeper, in Fantastic Beasts 1, Grindelwald tells Creedance that he is a squib, that he could smell it on him the first time he met him...  Grindelwald obviously has close connections with the LeStrange family, he held his rally in their tomb after all.. my belief is that Corvus was born along with a twin brother, and that Grindelwald identified one of the twins as a squib. Only Corvus Sr, Clarrise LeStrange, Irma, Grindelwald, and the “aunt” would know. Squib baby, being disposable, was used as decoy, Corvus across the hall. Reading the script, Creedance’s aunt’s only line is: “Irma? They want us to put on life jackets!”.  

A squib, although lacking magical ability, is still useful. But not to father LeStrange. My guess is that Grindelwald himself had Creedance placed in that magic hating household, to make him desperate and easily used later in life. That’s why Grindelwald, as Graves, had selected Creedance to identify the source of the obscurus. 

Linda Santiago is the actress who played Creedance’s aunt. We’ve heard that the next movie will feature Rio de Janeiro, I imagine her character will connect with Brazil. My guess is the Creedance’s aunt is a Lestrange relative that lived in Brazil who was tasked with raising Corvus away from France and in secret.

In CoG, we learn that Credence, *according to Grindelwald*, is actually Aurealis Dumbledore.

512,ajraptor,1546345650," 

**Facts we know for sure:**

1- Aurelius Dumbledore is not mentioned in history

2- Grindelwald possessed the Elder wand during the final battle but still lost but was taken alive i.e. knocked out or stopped fighting

3- Albus Dumbledore continuously downplays his role in defeat of Grindelwald

​

​

**What if:**

Aurelius is a half-brother of Albus as his father didn’t die in Azkaban but escaped to USA at the time mentioned for his death. During that time, he sired Aurelius in secrecy in USA.

Before the final battle Aurelius realizes that Gellert had been playing him from the start and turns on him. Thus, the final battle is not just between Albus and Gellert but a 3-way battle between Albus, Aurelius and Gellert . Aurelius dies in the battle. His betrayal as well as sudden death causes Gellert to lose his conviction and give up the fight.

​

​

**Parallels with the first battle:**

1- Both battles include Grindelwald and 2 Dumbledores (Albus+Aberforth and Albus+Aurelius) in a 3-way battle.

2- In both battles, a Dumbledore dies, first Ariana then Aurelius

3- Albus is left for cleanup after both battles

4- Each battle included an ***""unlettered but infinitely more admirable brother""*** of Albus Dumbledore. Aberforth was powerful and clear headed but unlettered while Aurelius was also powerful and only known case of surviving an obscurial past the age of 10.

​

​

**Why Aurelius is still forgotten by history?**

He wasn’t really known before the events and played an instrumental role in rise of Grindelwald. Thus, marking a Dumbledore as responsible for Grindelwald’s rise and subsequent downfall will add further controversies to the already controversial lineage. Hence, his involvement in the battle was kept a secret till the end.

​

**How this affects the original HP Universe?**

\- In known history, the Elder Wand has never been defeated in a proper duel :

\-Albus planned his downfall but was defeated by Draco when he wasn't even fighting.

\-Draco lost the wand when he was holding another wand

\-Grindelwald didn't really lose but gave up fighting and then got disarmed (if at all)

\- Nobody knows of Aurelius as he was always shrouded in mystery

\- Grindelwald's remorse in the Second Wizarding War was due to 2 of his most powerful allies ever turning on him making him question his earlier motives.",FantasticBeasts,The Duel of Ages was a 3-way Duel!,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/abhuh7/the_duel_of_ages_was_a_3way_duel/,1546316850.0

&gt;!He was in the trailers more then in the actual movie. Many of his scenes got cut. It was not made clear how he survived the first film (I hate having the google afterwards to understand a movie) How the F did he end up in Parise? Scene was cut... How did he end up with Skender? Also cut. Was about him looking at Nagini's poster? Not there. We didn't see one of Grindelwalds men giving him the note (I missed the 2 sec scene of Grindelwald instructing one of his followers to give it to him. And i was like ""WTF is that Credence? What is he giving her? What is happening.....!&lt;

&gt;!Was he a prisoner at the circus or only Nagini? His old nanny ignored most of his questions and gave awners to questions he did not ask. The fight scene was longer in the trailers.!&lt;

&gt;!Scene on the roof was also cut. Does he control his powers or not? He didn't even make Grimsonn flinch....!&lt;

&gt;!Even in acompaning books he seems to have the short end of the stick. He is barely in any of them at all! And if he is it is still with FB1 harecut and clothes. I've seen more pics with him and Nagini eating some bread. Not in the movie.....!&lt;

&gt;!After FB1 J.K. Rowling said he would ' come back to life in a 'very painfull' way. And now it's just ' Oh yeah. he's immortal OK. He wasn't even hurt in FB 1"". There was supposed to be a scene where he would go back to the church and find his birth certificate there and FOR THAT REASON go to Parise. And now he just happend to chill out there untill someobe passing him a lot saying ' He man luckey you. You're find your awnser within walking distance. Aren;t you luckey!' .....!&lt;

&gt;!Hell does he even know Grindelwald was Mr. Graves??? Why was he suddenly all huggy with Grindelwald? The character of FB1 would at least have \*some\* reserve...!&lt;

&gt;!Even the actor was worried they cut him from FB Beast 2 because he was confused his ' ressurection' scene was cut and he was killed of instead.!&lt;

&gt;!For me, i really like Newts character. But yeah he is a good guy. Dumbeldore will defeat Grindelwald and Newt will marry Tina. I already know their end and the ' inbetween' is just amusing filler.!&lt;

&gt;!The character of Credence is the only really interesting! And it seems they changed their mind completely on his storyline!

Hi,

First of all i apologize for my bad vocabulary, i am not a native and for taking your time coz i don't have anyone to talk about these things (Not much crazy potter fans in my country) I have been a HP fan for a long time now and every time i binge the series, i cry... Like tears roll down my face. I am too emotional with these stuffs. Also i haven't read the books (I am currently reading the first book but plan on saving the rest 6 for later, i get most comment to read the book but i think i should save them.) i have only watched the movies.. possibly like 6 times the whole series or may be more, i forget stuffs lol.

I think the reason i am attached to the potter world is coz my mom used to buy me Harry potter movies when i was small and i still remember them releasing movies year after year. Its Nostalgia that makes me like this.. I came to this last time i binged the series sub found a friend and stuff PMed for a bit and that was fun. I am probably came here now coz i watched Fantastic Beast CoG now and struck by how good it is and i just want to talk about it.

As i am not a book reader don't spoil the books or upcoming movies for me but what an awesome movie CoG was. Awesome graphics, awesome story.. so much fucking twist and i was just awesome seeing a WW movie again with Hogwarts and all. So there were many many references to HP than the first FB movie.

I got some question but dont spoil the books and upcoming movies.

Why tf was Nagini a human? she looked like she was on the good side. i feel bad for her now. also i saw some people criticizing for her being Asian i personally liked her in the movie.

and then it was twist after twist... Queenie turning to other side Lestrange dying credence being a Dumbledore.. Lets just talk about this awesome series of Wizarding World and how it connects. get in here.

Then there was an incident with a Jarvey that Leta was responsible for, and another student was hurt/endangered.  Newt decided to take the fall for what Leta actually did, and was expelled from Hogwarts as a result.  Because Leta ""was a taker"", this ended their relationship and broke Newt's heart.

That being said, I don't think the movie is perfect. The story *did* seem a little all over the place, not because of the content but because the events from scene to scene felt rushed instead if natural decisions made by the characters. Again, it doesn't mean I didn't like said events, I disliked the transitions between them. Sometimes it felt like the subplots overlapped without real connection. It made me wish JK would write the books and let someone else write the scripts.

That, and the music, would be my only big complains. I wish they would've made a more iconical soundtrack... It felt generic.

Surprisingly though, two of the most solid parts of the movie were every Dumbledore and Grindelwald's scenes. Before watching CoG I was a bit worried because 1) all the criticism Johnny Depp has had lately, 2) I wasn't sure Jude Law could portray Dumbledore for multiple reasons. **At the end**, their scenes were the ones that immersed me in the story the most. 

Since I tried to stay away from spoilers, the blood vow took me by surprise. That was a great little twist. It was a bit ""un-epic"" how Newt got the thing. Why would Grindelwald have the vial in such an easy place for someone to steal?

I also *loved* pretty much every scene with Newt in it. Interestingly enough, he wasn't really the hero of the movie nor the main protagonist by the end of it. That disappointed me a little, I was expecting a great character development for him but, in general, he only confessed to and *""chose a side""* quite forcefully.

Finally, what got my attention was the Credence subplot. He's more powerful than I imagined but I still can't see a real threat from him. He doesn't feel convinced enough yet. Same as I don't really see Newt convinced enough to be a hero for any violent cause yet. I still think he would look for another way to fight other than violence. But... you know... Epic magic movie, there has to be a big fight between heroes and villains at some point.

571,Newts-Commander,1545213215,"**The Obscurus: A Parasite at the Center of the Story**

While I am by no means a Harry Potter expert, I am an aficionado, and as such I have developed and am still developing a framework in which to fit all the amazing new information we have learned in the recent *Crimes of Grindewald*. I will go into several important points below, but take in mind that I am also a veterinary student with interest/experience in parasitology research: when I found out JKR was including parasites in here expanded wizarding world, I was ecstatic. Naturally, many of my ideas will be replaced or confirmed as future movies are released, but I believe the Obscurus will remain central to the story’s development.

**The nature of the parasite:** You can read as well as I can the Wiki page on the Obscurus, but suffice to say that this is a magical parasite which represents a dark force arising from a an Obscurial, the magical child with repressed magical energies in which it resides.The balance between parasite and its host is delicate: while the parasite wants to maximize the amount of resources it steals, it also wants to keep the host alive because it is a conduit for its activity, safety, and transmission in the world.

We meet a “tame” or dormant Obscurus in the first FB movie. It lives in Newt’s suitcase and comes from Newt’s previous experience with an Egyptian girl whom he was trying to save. Unfortunately, the wizard/witch who is host to an Obscurus often dies before they mature, after which the Obscurus typically dies too. However, it seems this isn’t always the case: **some Obscuri can survive outside the host** even after the host has died. How is the parasite removed? Can it be transmitted to a new host? Why does it prefer children who are magically repressed? How does it find the child in the first place (assuming it was transmitted to the child and not a manifestation of itself from birth)? All good questions that need answering.

Here is the question I want answered: first, where did Credence’s obscurus come from, and second, why is this important enough for JKR to put at the center of her story? I have a tentative answer below:

1. The Obscurus is often described as a “dark twin” of the Obscurial in which it resides. As such, it is intimately connected to that person. The most likely person from which it arose was Ariana Dumbledore, the sister of Aberforth and Albus. She had the clear hallmarks of an Obscurial, what with her magical repression at the age of 6, her uncontrollable powers and temper, and her clearly powerful magical blood. Though exact details of her death are unknown, it is likely that a) Grindelwald and Albus desired to use her as Grindelwald currently wants to use Credence, b) Aberforth would have been in favor of removing the Obscurus though worried it might kill her, and c) her Obscurus might have survived either upon removal or upon her accidental death. Why does it fit well with Credence? If the Obscurus left Ariana, it would have plausibly caused chaos wherever it went, such as a storm in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Credence was crying as a baby during a storm, the only event I know of where an Obscurus might have entered him. \[side note: the REAL LeStrange baby seems to have died in the ocean...BUT, the poem-prophecy says “return, great avenger with wings from the water” possibly a reference to the Obscurus entering one of the children who was in the water or coming out of the water itself before entering Credence…\] Further, Credence connects well with Ariana Dumbledore because we see a phoenix chick has found him somehow, before Grindelwald ever has a chance to trick or deceive him into thinking he is truly a Dumbledore by blood. Why would a phoenix come to Credence? Because part of Ariana now resides inside him—that powerful part calls the phoenix, just as the Fawks is drawn to Albus in the original seven books. Further, if Grindelwald knew about Ariana’s Obscurus and upon her death lost the Obscurus which he highly valued, it makes sense that he would search eagerly for it and after finding it in this boy, he would lie with a half-truth and tell him his new name is “Aurelius Dumbledore”. Some have speculated that this is potentially Ariana’s child, a long lost sibling of the Ariana/Aberforth/Albus, or just a relative….I believe it is a believable lie from Grindelwald because he knows part of the truth concerning the origin of the Obscurus inside Credence and he knows that a phoenix might be called to him, as was said of great-grandfather Dumbledore.

2. It makes sense that JKR would pull out an Obscurus from the backstory of Albus, Grindewald, and Ariana because these are all characters that have been directly placed in the story as important OR alluded to in the case of Ariana (though fleshed out previously in the seventh HP book). It also makes sense that in the context of a pentalogy about magical animals, parasitic magical organisms are a new and interesting direction to go but need to be introduced properly….so both the first and second movies so far have mentioned parasites directly, first in the context of the Obscurus and second in the context of the parasites “from water dragons” as was found in Yusef’s eye. Am I just interested in parasites? Well, after watching *Crimes of Grindelwald* a second time and being inspired to write this, her inclusion of the water dragon parasite seemed to be out of place unless you put it in the larger context of “reminding the audience that **parasites are central to the story**”. \[I also looked up more about the parasites just now on google, and found an article where HP fans mention the Ariana Obscurus theory that I came to on my own, so I feel like this is really on the right track…([https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/11/19/18102515/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-harry-potter-exit-survey](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/11/19/18102515/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-harry-potter-exit-survey))\]

When Grindelwald told Credence that “most heinous of betrayals was purposefully bestowed upon you”, it clinched the deal that Grindelwald, who feels betrayed by Albus already, connects that past relationship to what he knows about Credence’s origins.

&amp;#x200B;

I have remaining thoughts on several other topics that could get their own post….but I’ll just mention them now.

\-The logo with nine golden wands in the shape of a rising sun I believe represent the Order of the Phoenix or what currently exists as Dumbledore’s network of friends and will give rise to the Order of the Phoenix. Nicolas Flamel has a book with pictures on pages (nine of them?) which allows the members to communicate: so far, members include Albus, Nicolai, and Eulalia Hicks (an Ilvermorny professor). 

\-Birds seem to have taken a prominent role in these movies, including a thunderbird, a phoenix, a raven, owls (?), and several bird-like relatives such as the occamy (and hippogriff previously, maybe the snallygaster in the future).

\-The possible romantic relationship between Albus and Grindelwald seems to be confirmed by what Albus sees in the Mirror or Erised: Grindelwald himself. There relationship, when referred to as “being like brothers”, Albus turns around and says “we were closer than brothers”. This is a common euphemism when talking about gay relationships that originates as far back as the Old Testament, seen in the context of David’s and Jonathan’s speculated relationship. Furthermore, Grindelwald wears “his heart on his sleeve” when he wears the vial that represents the blood oath between Albus and himself.

\-Grindelwald represents the wizarding world equivalent of Hitler with his winsome rhetoric, his dividing of two people groups (Jews/non-jews::wizards/No-maj), and the ideal of a pure blood/arian race. The historical context of the coming WW2 adds so much to the story because he can play on the fear of the people—an actual war will come and destroy Paris.

\-Leta’s death plays a key role: when she attempts to kill Grindelwald and fails, she refocuses on destroying his magical skull artifact which seems to predict the future, and succeeds. This will probably be key later on now that he has lost this resource.

\-Lastly….Nagini is actually a good character, but we find out that her blood-curse will one day permanently turn her into a snake and then eventually kill her. How is this prevented? When Voldemort eventually makes her a Horcrux and so keeps her alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Just hoping to add to the discussion surrounding *Fantastic Beasts*—I haven’t done much reading or digging yet to see what else is out there, but this is my first Reddit post and I wanted to get the ideas out before absorbing too many other fan theories.

572,borednerd7,1545201885,"Saddest individual event for me goes to Irma Dugard's death. It was just so sudden and unfair and really caught me by surprise. I'm not sure why it affected me so much but that.

&amp;#x200B;

Saddest plot is everything to do with Queenie. I hate how much of the good she did in the last film seems to be reversed here (not negated, but the dramatic changes in her character). It's clear she's misguided and love is twisting her mind to do things she would ordinarily never do, which is tragic and heartrending, but it's also hard to have sympathy for someone who thinks it is acceptable to use force to bend someone to their will, especially someone they love. After the first movie Queenie was my absolute favorite character but she's honestly become so much less sympathetic now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also Leta's death. I really love Leta's character and how complex and layered she is and how that was developed in such a short amount of time, relatively speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

These movies and books make me wish my mind could better tease apart parasocial relationships from actual social ones lol

574,vivichase,1545182560,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Grindewald may actually be Corvus Lestrange.  I say this because JK Rowling is extremely unlikely to make the story's central prophecy so obvious.  It is not what it seems, in the same way the Halfblood Prince was not who we thought (i.e. Harry, Voldemort). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*A Son Cruelly Banished*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Despair of the Daughter*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Return, Great Avenger*  
&gt;  
&gt;*With Wings from the Water*

&amp;#x200B;

The most obvious interpretation of this prophecy is:

* *Son Cruelly Banished* = Credence
* *Despair of the Daughter* = Ariana
* *Return, Great Avenger / With Wings from the Water* = Credence

Most people who are unfamiliar with JK Rowling's plotting style and her tendency to culminate major, tantalizing, enormously significant plot questions with a twist, will draw the conclusion above.  But of course, we know better.  Here is my theory on why the Great Avenger is Grindelwald, who is in fact Corvus Lestrange who did not die as an infant.  The prophecy by Tycho Dodonus is actually centered around Grindewald, not Credence  Several of these reasons below are speculative and based on my predictions given JK Rowling's plot styling.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Return****, Great Avenger*

&amp;#x200B;

The use of the word *""return""* is JK Rowling's effort to mislead us.  *""Return""* strongly leads the audience to think it must be Credence, who is returning after being a long-lost brother.  The words *""banish""* and *""return""* is an intuitive pairing, and is the conclusion most likely to be drawn.  And this is why it must be wrong.  If Credence is not the *""****son*** *cruelly* ***banished****""*, then the list of possible candidates is: Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Newt, or an unknown character.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*With* ***Wings*** *from the* ***Water***

&amp;#x200B;

The **water** refers to the ship sinking.  The **wings** refer to a black raven.

The raven is the animal on the **Lestrange family crest.**  It is also the **symbol** that **Grindelwald** has chosen for his cause**.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Lestrange Family Crest](https://i.redd.it/3mvyn2fav4521.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

[Grindewald's Symbol](https://i.redd.it/b5w40y3jt4521.jpg)

Now why was Corvus Lestrange on that ship?  We know Corvus' father loved him, and sent him away to protect him from Laurena Kama's family, who sought revenge for his imperiusing and kidnapping (and rape) of Laurena.  Corvus died the night of the ship sinking.  **Or did he?**  I think perhaps Corvus' father deliberately had that ship sunk and fake Corvus' death, thus protecting him from Laurena's family, who swore to kill Corvus.  Corvus' father was a despicable man, and his willingness to kill an entire boat of innocent people to save his son is entirely in his character.  Corvus grew up secretly, perhaps even in Grindelwald, Switzerland (a city in the Swiss Alps directly adjacent to Germany).  Corvus then attended Durmstrang.  Perhaps he changed his name from Corvus to Grindewald to conceal his identity.

**Summary:**

1. The Lestrange family crest is a **raven.**
2. Grindewald symbol is a **raven.**
3. The rally location Grindewald chooses is the **Lestrange family crypt** in Paris ([Cimetière du Père-Lachaise](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_du_P%C3%A8re-Lachaise)).
4. Corvus is Latin for **raven.**

**Further Considerations:**

It's still unclear who the *""son cruelly banished""* and *""daughter's despair""* is.  The leading theory is Credence is the son, and Ariana is the daughter.  If Credence is the son *""cruelly banished""*, it implies he was sent away out of malevolence.  Since Credence was born 9 years after his mother's death, the only logical possibility is he is the son of his father and another woman.  Since his father was in Azkaban, Credence would have been conceived there.  The other woman may have been another inmate at Azkaban.  She later was released (she couldn't have escaped, since we know Sirius Black is the only inmate who ever escaped Azkaban) and gave birth to Credence.  It is unclear why either Dumbledore's father or this other woman banished Credence.

&amp;#x200B;

The *""daughter's despair""* refers to Ariana, with the *""despair""* being that she killed her own mother.  It's unclear if this *""daughter's despair""* is casually related to either the *""son cruelly banished""* or *""Return, Great Avenger / With Wings from the Water""*.  My hypothesis is that it's likely the former.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this all make sense?  It might just be a few fries short of a happy meal here.  :/

579,iuriau,1545142851,"So I've been thinking about this since I woke up today, and I might be missing or skiping some info we've had from the HP series.

From HP, we've always known Dumbledore was one of the most powerful wizards ever. I always assumed this knowledge came mainly from him being the one to defeat Grindewald, the great dark wizard before Voldemort.

In CoG it is said more than once that Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard out there, besides Grindewald, and the only one that can rival him in power and defeat him. My question is: how does everybody know that?

CoG's Dumbledore is portrayed as a young wizard, in the early stages of his teaching carreer. We know he will later even be considered for Minister, but this is all only after Grindewald is imprisoned in his castle. So, what had he done that made every wizard, even ministry aurors, state that he was more powerfull than all of them? I know he already was friends with Flamel, so his works with alchemy were probably already known, and maybe the uses of dragon blood as well. But besides this, what else? Was he known as a skilled duelist? His fame as a transfigurator or DAD teacher were that big already? Did he do something uterly impressing as a student - as is school/college fame enough for someone to be know as the best of them all?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just trying to figure out how Achilles would play into the story seeing as he seemed to be a minor (and possibly fake) boyfriend of Tina. I've seen theories that he's someone who's got ins with Grindelwald and is trying to get close to Tina which would be very interesting. In FB1 we had little hints for characters in FB2, as briefly as they were mentioned (like ""Theseus Scamander, the war hero?"" + all the Leta stuff). I might be looking into it too much, but I feel like Queenie's could have just been left at ""Tina's seeing someone"" without mentioning Achilles name, but the fact she did makes me thing it's just a tiny piece of foreshadowing we might see him in the next movie. I hope it doesn't play out like some dramatic love triangle or anything like that seeing as we spent all of COG finally seeing Newt and Tina establish their feelings for one another, I just couldn't deal with another whole movie of pining tbh we know they get married lol just let it happen.

583,azgx29,1545098050,"Ok ok. Hear me out about this. Let me first say the Grindelwald is not Hitler. Hitler had no reason to get rid of Jews like he did. Grindelwald on the other hand kinda has just motives for wanting to expose wizard kind. You even hear him say that he doesn’t want to kill all muggles but only the necessary amount. Plus we have to remember the position they are in. To most wizards it isn’t fair how they cannot be free and cannot marry who they want and express themselves. After thinking for a while can we really consider him being a villain. Yes he does some very bad things but as he said in his mind he is doing it for the greater good. He wants to forcefully expose wizard kind. You can also see the regret he has after killing the muggle family in Paris. That look to me means that he is making the hard choices for the greater good. Also we have to consider the ministry now as well. Like they are true villain of this movie. Anyone who listens to him must be arrested. Have you heard of free speech. They choose to listen. They were not forced. Also Travers practically put Dumbledore on house arrest because he won’t help them. It is not like they can make him. Bottom line, how can we consider him a villain when he wants to help wizards. And until we know whether he wants to get rid of most if not all of Muggles like Vinda Rosier, or just want to harm some more to forcefully expose Wizard kind and rule with them or over them. He wants wizards free.

He was obviously a popular character from the first film with a lot of folk admiring colin farrells performance and im pretty sure I might have spotted a few clues on his possible return.

First off, it would make complete sense thst Graves would want a new identity, probably feeling ashamed about being tricked by Grindelwald and putting others at risk, not to mention how others might treat him going forward. 
They mention his name at least once and Jacob laughs, almost like its a made up name. Newt stresses for the second time in the movie that he's a auror to really establish that point.
Lastly, the first film makes it clear Tina and Graves did have at least a working relationship before she was demoted and he his identity was assumed by Grindelwald, so perhaps with her being upset over Newts ""engagement"" and him feeling ashamed they somehoe comforted each other.",FantasticBeasts,Tinas new boyfriend...,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/a6y276/tinas_new_boyfriend/,1545007017.0

592,RedSiren2,1544996529,"(because I’m pretty tired of all the nagging about it - here’s some positivity)

______________________________________________________

1. Tina thinks that Newt is engaged, but moved on with her life and started dating someone else. She doesn’t go crazy or hate Leta for what is happening, it is Newt who seeks her and does everything in his power to explain to her that he didn’t betray her trust

2. Leta and Tina get along, are even nice to each other – yes, we only see them together after Tina learns they aren’t engaged, but let’s not forget that she had an extremely special friendship with Newt, and he fell in love – both which Tina knows, but she’s still open and friendly to her

3. Leta Lestrange – honesty I did not expect, but she never makes a secret of what she has done (despite as a child) and how she sees herself – more critical than healthy of course, but she’s a very true character ... but is she? We don’t know everything about her yet...

4. The Scamander brothers have their issues, but never lie to each other – Newt was accordingly “evasive” during previous questionings, furthering the point

5. What Leta does has consequences – but not bad ones, if you look closely. She switched the babies, but saved Credence – she attacked Grindelwald and apparently died (though I think she faked) but it brought Newt and Theseus back together

6. Leta specifically said that Corvus V was the last male member of House Lestrange – yet three followed in the next decades, carrying her name

7. What Newt does firstly seems good, but has bad consequences – he doesn’t want to hear Queenie’s side of the story and forces her to lift Jacob’s spell, pretty impulsively – and by that is a little bit responsible for her switching sides – also, he could at least try to make things work with the engagement – but he doesn’t. Theseus is apparently tired of this after several months, but Leta still tries to encourage him to be a part of their new family – which he rejects

8. The scene with the Hogwarts incident that got Newt expelled was left out – at first I was mad, but I feel like this is going to come back later …

9. We see obvious flares in Newt’s behaviour – he’s pretty judgemental of all aurors, kind of obsessed with finding Tina (let’s not forget how he was hung up on Leta for 15 years)

10. The movie yet now fully jumps on the fact that he falls onto the Aspergers spectrum – both showing that there are things he cannot change, but many that he can if he wants to

11. All characters are, in a way, crazy, and they make mistakes, which becomes a vital aspect of the story

12. A small typing error in a newspaper led to a conflict between Newt and Tina – sounds like a message about the effect of media/fake news

13. The costumes – Newt is depressed (grey coat, less done hair), Tina is gaining confidence (leather coat), and Queenie’s clothing is darker, more laced up … and Theseus’ clothing gets darker the more he stands against Newt, but when they start fighting together, his hair loosens, and it starts looking much like his brother’

14. The relationship between him and Leta – they got together, I think, because of their respective traumas, but we see that they both aren’t over them – he starts finding himself and peace again by the end, but she leaves

15. During Newt’s questioning, he sits on one side, the ministry officials at the other – by the end, they all stand on one side before Hogwarts

16. Newt and Tina didn’t kiss. Thank God – they really need to be in the same place for a while and date like most people. Not to mention that there are things they have to personally work on before they can start a relationship - I’m all in for the message that the best romance is the one that grew slowly, not exploded

17. The ministry does have a reason not to trust Dumbledore – they know about his relationship to Grindelwald, and he even admits how close they were

18. The Scamander brothers both stray from standing alongside when it comes to important things, very much so – but both get back to it in the end, firmly. Someone already said that this stands as a contrast to Tina and Queenie, who seemed like perfect sisters in the first movie - I think Newt and Theseus stand for that someone you can argue with a lot, but still stand together with when it really matters - kind of making a point that you don’t have to agree always, and avoiding conflict all the time isn’t going to help when it can’t be avoided any more

19. All main characters cry once again – and Theseus joins, literally, by the end.

20. Grindelwald makes for a very interesting villain because you see him do/plan terrible things, but at the same time it’s hard to stay strong when he presents that there will be a second world war they could stop (which he personally doesn’t plan, but nobody in the crypt knows that)

21. The Niffler has a magnificent role in the end – I couldn’t believe how he suddenly fit into the plot

22. I think we get a lot of set up for the coming movies … Abernathy’s tounge is still cut, Circus Arcanus is still out there somewhere with people and beasts in captivity, not to mention knowledge of Credence’ person of several months

23. We get an interesting set of heritages of actors playing certain characters – especially in connection to Durmstrang : Skender is Russian, but his actor is icelandic, so he could have been to that school – so is Grimmson. And perhaps the women we saw playing Credence’ aunt – she is Swedish actress Linda Santiago. And let’s take a note of that they could ALL have gone to school with Grindelwald. Let’s keep that in mind (more on Linda being Swedish in my 20 hints on Credence actual identity theory)

24. The character of Yusuf Kama is sent to kill Corvus V by his father – later on, Grindelwald proposes to send Credence into battle to kill Dumbledore – who sends in Newt to at least work against Grindelwald

25. The blood oath – I have NO idea how they will break it, but I think afterwards it will still take Dumbledore time to overcome his fear of the knowledge of who really was responsible for Ariana’s death and his remaining love for Grindelwald – which could lead to a huge conflict one day, we’ll see

26. Jude Law plays Dumbledore perfectly. Enough said.

27. All actors nail their roles perfectly. I can’t see Eddie Redmayne any longer when he plays Newt, and everyone else gives 100% as well – newcomer Callum Turner really surprised me

28. Dumbledore sees himself and Grindelwald in the mirror of Erised, then himself as Grindelwald – both showing his remaining love for him and how he may wish to make the step he made and actively change the course of the world(s)

29. Hogwarts is wonderful as always – the child actors were magnificent (young Newt was on point) and I love how they had different uniforms back then

30. So, McGonnagall was in this film – like I said, it could either be a case of Mandela effect (look it up) or JK is playing a prank on us by adding Minerva’s father’s sister who may have been the greatest role model for her/named after her – not only did we have this before, but we get it in this movie with the line of “Corvus”

31. JK tried really hard to make everything work and keep us guessing – she even putted in that the ministry used Owls to deliver messages even back when Mr. Weasley joined – which was mentioned in ONE sentence during the fifth book

32. The group splits up in the end – but everyone is where he should be. Tina, Newt and Jacob are together, Nagini is not alone, Theseus now not only has his brother back, but also a war veteran (I still think they have a history that was obliviated from Jacob’s mind) who has lost his own brother and is certainly going to take action in the brothers being nice to each other – as will Tina, who I think will be getting along with him, especially now that he is on the right path again – I still believe she has many of the qualities he had when he was younger, and can regain faster with her help – not to mention that he can employ her as head of the auror’s office, and has known her love interest all his life.

33. The thing with the hugging – it’s interesting. When Theseus does it the first time, he does it slowly, kind of letting Newt prepare (indicating their past) – when Jacob hugs him, he smiles, implying that he doesn’t have a massive problem, but he shows emotions otherwise (remember how he told Jacob in the first movie how much he liked him? That’s his kind of expressing love by that point) – the Zou-Ou hugs him too, but he laughs – and he hugs Theseus, showing that he can apply to this kind of interaction if he wants to – which we know he learns on an even bigger basis considering that he had children with Tina – he just needs a while – and Queenie is with Credence. That makes for an interesting story :)

34. Jacob loves Queenie so much that he’s willing to let her go – Tina loves her so much that she won’t even consider letting her break the law – but they both deny her being with the man she wishes to be with. Everyone is making a choice …

35. When Vinda Rosier and Grindelwald get to her, she’s all alone and desperate – kind of picking up the theme of witches being approached by the devil and offered what they desire

36. Grindelwald’s way to manipulate and be a devil pretending very well to be non-offensive and welcoming is VERY refreshing – it’s hard to tell if he plays it or not for the characters, even Dumbledore

37. We meet all kinds of names – Carrow, Goldstein, Travers, Lestrange, Rosier – and it’s interesting to wonder how their children/grandchildren happened/what their stories will be

38. Abernathy had an interesting comeback – he really stands for all the people who are drawn in by Grindelwald, but you can tell they’re not entirely convinced

39. Grindelwald told Credence that he is “Aurelius Dumbledore” – yet not only do we know Kendra died two years before he was even conceived, but we also know that he will not be the one the phoenix comes to – and that Grindelwald lied to him directly before. Also, we get the topic of hugging again – he embraces him the second film in a row, which makes me wonder if he meets Theseus in the next and realizes what it feels like when someone really means it

40. Theseus he has been through a war, and 20 years of his job, having watched colleagues die – he is accordingly damaged, and shows obvious symptoms of PTSD – like having some problems letting others that close, sometimes being angry and suspicious (although from his point of view, he did have reasons to think his brother was on the wrong side – especially when he used his face to break into the French ministry) but by the end, he kind of finds the rebel and what he really wants/should do back

41. Leta’s “I love you” – she loved both Newt and Theseus in different ways, and related to both their personalities (which is a lot, considering how different these two sometimes are) – also making a strong point for that a family doesn’t have to be many people – two men can be enough

42. Credence doesn’t really appreciate Grindelwald, I think … he says himself that he only wants to know who he is, and he thinks he has no other place to go … but I think once he gets a better option, he will consider it

43. Nagini is accordingly Indonesian, yet her actress is Korean – I wonder if they set her up two be half-korean and (if we assume she is only 25) considering the Japanese influence (that later on became violent) she is a former student of Mahoutokoro

44. I like how we see Dumbledore not being all powerful yet – he has a lot of his later sass already, but I like how he still stands at the beginning of his journey to become the man we know from HP. Also, in his cunning and assembling way, he does resemble Grindelwald a lot … in his own way

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!""They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.”!&lt;

&gt;!... It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.”!&lt;

&gt;!“I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.”!&lt;

To me this is the most powerful piece of character development for Dumbledore in that it shows no matter how powerful a wizard he is and ingenious in his plans he is ultimately a character driven by fear and shame. To me the idea that the real reason he didn't fight Grindelwald because of a &gt;!magical blood pact the pair of them made!&lt; really undermines that character development and kind of lets him off the hook.

The man was the hammiest, the most over the top villain since Jeremy Irons in Dungeons and Dragons. He was such a cericature I could never take him seriously. Not even when I first watched Goblet of Fire as a fourteen year old. It's not even true to his portrayal in the books, where he was usually calm and collected, menacing figure. With movie Voldemort, I had no idea why anyone would follow this goofy buffoon.

The funny thing is that, in an interview I've seen, David Yates said he wanted Voldemort to be ""human"". Lol, wut. I have no idea what type of humans Yates spends his time with, but I don't think they act like cheesy cartoon bad guys.

Then there is Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's the best performance in Depp's career, but it's waaaaay better than Ralph's Voldy.

Depp's Grindelwald actually acts like a person, and doesn't chew scenery in every damn scene he's in. He's subtler, more persuasive, and more believable. I could buy this guy having followers with no problem.

Is Depp so hated in that role only because of his personal scandal, or is it also about the acting?

619,Bemorte,1544644430,"Voldemort has always struck me as so narrow minded and self-obsessed. He was powerful, demented, and extremely selfish. He treats his followers terribly, and all who join him, fear him and seek to please him out of that fear. And in a villain, those things are intimidating and awful, but not terrifying or lasting.

Grindelwald is power hungry, sure, but he is fighting for a greater purpose and has a plan to remake the world. We know he is capable of love and friendship, and he treats his followers and potential followers as a family. His lies are subtle, his methods thought out, clever, and meticulous. He does not rule in power, but in building a movement. The only ones who fear him are those who directly oppose him. 

I would make the argument, that Voldemort is a inferior villain to Grindlewald. And while Voldemort’s reign of terror was awful, the ideas that Grindlewald championed outlasted him and his followers. 

This is why when Grindlewald taunts Voldemort in the Book, you get a sense of how small Voldemort is as a man. Grindlewald goes to his death with confidence and cleverness, while Voldemort is terrified of it.

And you know the rest, Leta switches baby's, ship sinks, most likely the aunt dies with corvus. 

What Grindelwald is likely telling Aurelius however, is that Albus tried to dispose of him when he was a baby because he knew Aurelius was going to be more powerful than him and so Albus's aunt took him to America to save him from Albus and so Albus sunk the ship they were traveling on to get rid of him.

632,Vampire_Maester,1544531435,"First of all I think Dumbledore saw many similarities between Newt and Hagrid, and he decided to keep Hagrid in Hogwarts, because he was afraid thet he [Hagrid] might become an outcast. In my opinion he saw what Newt's interests did to him, and was afraid Hagrid may suffer worse, as he didn't graduate Hogwarts like Newt and unlike the latter wasn't derived from a known family.
This being said, I imagine Newt once being invited as a special guest for a lesson of Care of Magical Creatures and when Hagrid met him, heard his stories and adventures he realised that he wants to become just like Newt. So he started to take care of bizarre creatures in Hogwarts, but he wanted to be more daring than Newt and decided to take care of an Acromantula, which might be considered as a mistake...
As I have mentioned above, I belive Albus cannot let a half-giant out into the world, without any posessions, a wand, or magic knowledge. So he decided to offer him the job of the Gamekeeper. Of course, this would somehow kill Hagrids dreams, for he wanted to travel the world, meet many beasts and creatures. To help him out Albus made a surprise and invited Newt to Hagrid's hut.
Of course, old Newt and Hagrid become good freinds, for they shared such a big love for creatures the other didn't care about. Newt would keep visiting Hagrid, and once even invited to his managerie, which was a dream come true for Hagrid.
I imagine them sitting either in Hagrid's or Newt's place every weekend or so, discussing the behaviour of each other's beasts, the weird yellowish colour of Hippogryph's fieces that might indicate some minor illness, Newt would give some advices, retell some stories and just sip some tea and sweets.

**The blood pact between Dumbledore and Grindelwald will be destroy with a nuclear bomb** !

&amp;#x200B;

So let me do a quick recap of what we know so far of the history of Grindelwald and Dumbledore :

1) 1890's : They where so close that they made a blood pact that supposedly prevent them to harm one-another.

2) 1899 : They was a fight involving them and Abelforth where Ariana was killed

3) 1927 (FB2) : Newt Scamander gets the blood pact and gives it to Dumbledore who says that he may be able to destroy it.

4) 1945 : Dumbledore fights and win against Grindelwald who's send to Nurmengard prison.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so that leaves us with 18 years where we don't know yet what happened. The only thing we can really assume will happened in that time, is that somehow, the blood pact will be destroyed. Yet, 18 years seems like a long time for Albus Dumbledore, the most powerful wizard of his time, to do so.

My theory is that he doesn't succeed. Not by himself, not with the help of any wizard, and certainly not with magic. After all, how could any spell, potion are artefact could destroy an object made with a powerful magic by two powerful wizards.

But what is more powerful than magic ? Well, we muggles may only have technology, but with it, we are able to create weapons. Weapons that we perfect and improve. And in 1945, during World War II, we took a leap forward by creating and using the most destructive weapon of all : the atomic bomb.

So just imagine. After years of trying, Dumbledore still fails to destroy de Blood Pact and maybe even abandon the idea. Maybe he started to fight Grindelwald but indirectly, on a more ""ideological"" level. But then, August 6th 1945, everything changes. The first nuclear bomb strikes Hiroshima and he realises how powerful it is. He then learn (or foresee) that there's gonna be a second one. He first thought of preventing it, but he couldn't do it without revealing the magical world, thus making Grindelwald win. Yet he (or Nwet ?) took the blood pact to the point of impact, Nagasaki. The second atomic bomb strike, and destroy the Blood Pact.

Now free of the pact, but devastated and furious of what he just let happened, he attacks Grindelwald directly, during the most legendary duel ever fought between wizards, putting and end to the chaos in the wizarding world, and becoming the master of the elder wand.

1. When Queenie originally shows up with Jacob at Newt’s house in London she says her and Tina have not been talking because Tina doesn’t approve of her sister dating a no-maj. But Newt finds the postcard sent from Paris that Tina sent to Queenie.

2. When Queenie shows up at the French Ministry there is no record of Tina working with the French Ministry.

3. After Newt &amp; Tina remove the beast from Yusuf’s eye, Tina tries to dash off from Flamel’s saying she has to get back to the ministry to report her findings.

There is no record of Tina working for the French ministry according to the woman working the entrance, and yet Tina tries to report back to the ministry. Was the woman working the main entrance lying? If Queenie &amp; Tina weren’t talking, did someone else send the postcard to Queenie? Did Grindelwald send the postcard? Was Roselier (spelling, sorry) retrieving Queenie from the rain intentionally set up by Grindelwald months in advance?

But I have to vent so here goes.

Dumbledore: why oh why does there have to be this blood pact between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Would it have been too complicated to show a younger Dumbledore, one who is less sure of himself. One who doesn't want to face Grindelwald because it would mean facing the fact that he possible killed his own sister. Facing the possibility that Grindelwald might use that information to destroy his standing in the wizard community. And also that Grindelwald has the elder wand and Dumbledore would have believed Grindelwald was unbeatable in a fight. All of that combined with the fact the Grindelwald is the love of his life (they did that well tbf) would have been great. A complicated Dumbledore with every reason in the world not to want to face Grindelwald. It would have been great to watch him struggle with his own fears vs what he believed to be right. Eventually you would have the massive payoff of him going to stand between Grindelwald and the wizarding world. Knowing full well what was at stake and wanting Dumbledore  to fight, to become the man you know he can be. But no there's a blood pact so he can't move against him..... epic.

&amp;#x200B;

Credence: I really don't care about this character, why is he here? I enjoyed in the first movie where it finally showed exactly why it's a good idea for wizards to stay in hiding. But I think he should have stayed dead. I feel like they're trying to tap into the adoption issues of the current day but it's just wayyy too niche. 

Lestrange: Glad she's dead, she weighed down the film. My boggart is her character dragging down this movie. Hopefully she'll stay dead. The baby swap survivors guild thing I mean it just ties back into the Credence character who I really think should not even be in this movie.

&amp;#x200B;

The fan service: dear god in heaven, this is just painful, heavy handed and having the opposite of the intended effect. If there's a name you might recognize from the Harry Potter franchise time to shill it in regardless of context. Nagini was a person? WoW Neville will be glad to know he's a killer. McGonagall at hogwarts in that era? no, she didn't become the professor for transfiguration until Dumbledore left that position to become headmaster. He never had anyhting to do with Defence against the dark arts. But of course he has to be in that position so that we can have the survivor's guild boggart scene. Lore be damned it's vital to the plot!  

&amp;#x200B;

What I liked:

The acting is really really good, which is such a relief as I was afraid for Grindelwald in particular but Johnny Depp nails it. I also really liked Jude law's mannerisms as Dumbledore, again he is doing a great job I just don't like what they are doing with the character.

Grindelwald. Good job here, nice to see a villain be cunning and sly like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd do in the third one. 

Lot's of backstory with Dumbledore and Grindelwald in Godric's Hollow, seriously I want to empathise with Dumbledore.

Treat the lore as history not an alternate universe.

Have credence be eaten by a fantastic creature hehehe.

More Nifler babies nom nom nom so cute &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

The first film for me, was the first movie in the Harry Potter universe that I enjoyed watching. It wasn't perfect but it was rock solid and most of all it had incredible potential to become an amazing series. As I said above I'm not willing to go through another horrendous franchise of films year after year being told be friend ""no this one is good, really!"" and then you go see it and want to cry for all the wrong reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone got this far then wow, this has been a true rant, thank you for enduring it :P

David: “Yeah, McGonnagall. We just touch on McGonnagall, but she *would*  be at Hogwarts! So it felt very organic. It wasn’t us being like ‘Okay,  now let’s think. How can we bring another-‘.

I cannot say how- of course  that’s not to say that the characters, or the way you dress them and  things like that aren’t – those are really carefully considered. But the  process is very organic, and it’s about serving the story that Jo is  telling. It’s not looking from the outside in. It’s not ‘How are we  going to make it work for the audience?’.

675,BasilFronsac,1543859527,"Preface: this is more me thinking out loud rather than fully-formed theory.

1. I tried to translate some parts of the poem into French (after all the movie is set in France and Rowling speaks French) and I found something possibly interesting; wings from the water translates to aile de l'eau. 

2. Voldemort should rather be vol de la mort in French so maybe Rowling dropped the article here as well, making it aile d'eau.

3. The avenger might come from a boat or more poetically from a raft. A raft in French is un radeau.

4. Now if you connect it -&gt; *aile d'eau, radeau* and pronounce it, it sounds like El Dorado (Spanish for the golden one, Aurelius anyone?).

5. Now the third movie is thought to be set in Rio where they speak Portuguese. And what's dorado in Portuguese? Dourado. And who was Castelobruxo Headmistress while Armando Dippet was at Hogwarts? Benedita Dourado. [Who actually visited Hogwarts](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/castelobruxo).

6. Dourado is also a name for different kinds of fish.

TL;DR I think Castelobruxo and its Headmistress will have an important role in the series. It's possible we see her visit Hogwarts and meet Armando Dippet.

677,RedSiren2,1543856534,"Hi there :)

This is a summary of all the reason I’ve found or been given for Credence actually being a lost brother of the Goldsteins, likely even Tina’s twin brother - we get a lot of hints throughout the movie :) And I am now 100% sure that Grindelwald lied to him - so enjoy :)

___________________________


1. Credence was born around 1901 - **the same year as Tina**
2. Tina was born in August - when the ship sinks (in the Northern Atlantic, so the climate is around similar) - there is no ice to be seen anywhere, so there is a chance that it is summer
3. His “aunt” has dark hair and eyes - like Tina and her father
4. and the only hint we get on the aunt we see being a Dumbledore is **Grindelwald’s word**
5. Kendra Dumbledore, his “mother”, **died in summer 1899**, after Ariana attacked her - so even if she was pregnant by another man we don’t know about (since her husband died in Azkaban), her baby had to be at least 7/8 months old, maybe less as a wizard, to survive - and wouldn’t be almost a newborn in 1901. And we may know about the date of her death - but Credence doesn’t.
6. If the woman we saw was a relative of the Goldsteins, she either died when the ship sank or **lived to tell** the couple that their son had drowned - when in reality, **Leta Lestrange had saved his life** (Go Leta!)
7. The prophecy we hear could have been made around 1900 - I believe the Goldsteins were about to have twins when it became clear that their son was thought to be the “great avenger” by Grindelwald (maybe even through a vision) and was thus in danger of abduction - so they might have sent him away with a relative, and then claimed he died at birth - why they followed to the US later is still unclear, but they may have fled from his wrath when their sceme was discovered
8. Someone mentioned recently that there is a chance one of the two went to Durmstrang with Grindelwald, since their name “Goldstein” is german, and, like all greater wizarding schools, the academy takes students from several countries - also, the actress of the aunt, Linda Santiago, is swedish - one of the possible countries of location of Durmstrang - also, this could explain why they named their second child “Queenie”, since Sweden is a kingdom
9. **The name “Aurelius” means “golden, gilded”**
10. Grindelwald planned to use Credence as a weapon against Dumbledore, according to Pottermore, **in the first film already**
11. **He lied before** about a vision he had to Credence in the first movie - but a vision he had, it’s confirmed
12. The prophecy talks about **a desperate daughter** - Tina has been following/watching over him for two movies now, and something definitly drives her … maybe something she can’t explain?
13. Maybe Tina’s tendency to be nervous is intended as a result of being seperated from her twin brother?
14. When Tina looks into the death potion, **she firstly sees her family - and then Credence**
15. Queenie and him are seen together at Nurmengard - and they now have time to get to know each other and maybe find that they do have a special feeling when being together … 
16. The prophecy says “wings from the water” - now, this could point towards the Scamander (god of the river) brothers, or, maybe in combination - **tears.** Noticably, all main characters in FB cry frequently… my headcannon is that Credence, at one point, decides to finally turn on Grindelwald - who then forcefully separates him from his Obscurus to not have to deal with him. It seems at first that he is dead, but through the tears of everyone around, and the **love** they feel for him, the sibling and friend his obscurus used to be is replaced - as Dumbledore once said, love is one of the strongest forces on earth - **and he arises.** 
17. Grindelwald uses a Chupacabra as a weapon during his escape, which he hugs and then throws out (though I think he’s still alive and they’ll meet in Rio), calling it needy - you can seamlessly connect this treatment to Credence, but the interesting part is - he calls him **“Antonio”.** Since Chupacabra are often found in South America, I think he decided to name him the spanish version of “Anthony” There is a student at Hogwarts around Harry’s time, named **“Anthony Goldstein”** - and I do believe Grindelwald chose this name intentionally
18. If he stood between Tina and Queenie, they visually could be relatives - he may have black hair, but he shares the pointy, large nose with Queenie and Mrs. Goldstein - and **Tina’s Salamander eyes.**
19. Right after Credence finds Irma Dugard, and they talk for a bit, long enough so she can reassure him of his proposed identity (after not having seen him for 25 years), **she is killed by Grimmson** - I believe either to prevent her from saying more than Grindelwald needs him to know for his next step, or because she knew something that could have led him on the right trail … maybe she did notice that the baby she gave up for adoption was smaller, but decided to do it anyway to give him a home …
20. Small last adding: Anthony Goldstein is a member of House Hufflepuff - this house is known for friendship and hard work - Credence worked hard all his life, both for the Salemers and the Circus, and he showed great love for his sisters and Nagini so far … I do believe he would be sorted into this house :)

So, what do you think?

Anything to add? I think there is still much to discover…

If it wasn't for the potato quality cam footage we would never have noticed. The skull is engraved with phrase ""For the greater good"" in German, and it may give Gindelwald seer-like abilities.

679,BorsadiHermione,1543848699,"Hello everybody!  After seeing Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald 3 times, I got out of the theater this last time convinced that **Queenie is Snape 2.0**, and **Abernathy is the key** to understanding the behavior of Queenie and Tina in this film...

&amp;#x200B;

Abernathy was supervisor of the Goldstein sisters at MACUSA in New York, and he was responsible for their activities and knowing their whereabouts.

How could the Goldstein sisters *not* have noticed their boss at MACUSA behaving strangely and then disappearing altogether to serve Grindelwald? It doesn't appear to be explained in the screenplay.

This is especially curious, as in the previous film Queenie is shown apparently reading Abernathy's mind and manipulating him as she is carrying the suitcase with Tina and Newt inside...

&amp;#x200B;

**So here's the theory:**

Once Abernathy started acting strange and finally disappeared in order to serve Grindelwald and take his place in prison, Tina and Queenie caught on to what was happening.

Queenie could hear everything that was going on in Abernathy’s head, and therefore she and her sister knew more than most others about Grindelwald’s plan and perhaps how Creedance was a part of it.

When the escape happened, the sisters hatched a plan to go to Paris to find Creedence, save him from being killed by aurors from the ministries of several countries, and also subtly work against Grindelwald. 

Along the way, the sisters planned to enlist the help of Newt Scamander (and by association, Dumbledore’s help as well).

It's also important to note that Tina and Queenie gained new knowledge by becoming friends with Newt Scamander: Tina was present at Newt’s interrogation at MACUSA, so she knows he wasn't really in New York for appaloosa puffskins or even his thunderbird Frank.....it was mostly a cover story for his mission on behalf of Dumbledore.

So, following Newt's example, the sisters develop their own cover story for their trip to Europe:   Tina going to Paris as her Auror self, seeking out Creedance as she always has (and as Grindelwald would fully expect her to). Queenie travelling to England on the pretense of marrying Jacob, but really to recruit Newt Scamander to help them.  

Queenie left the torn up Paris postcard in the London house for Newt to find, so that he could join the sisters in their mission in Paris. 

It seems like too much of a coincidence in Paris, when Queenie enters the ministry just after Rosier and her former boss Abernathy. In fact, as Queenie asks very awkwardly and obviously at the ministry where her sister is..... she spills her suitcase just as Vinda Rosier and Abernathy walk past. Queenie should have been able to hear their thoughts and immediately should have recognised her former MACUSA boss with or without his polyjuice potion disguise...

Things appear to have gone a little haywire, however, when Queenie ""drank the tea"" at Grindelwald's hideout, and came under his manipulative influence...

&amp;#x200B;

I really believe, along with a few others here, that in the next films Queenie will mirror Severus Snape. She will stay close to Creedance/Aurelius to protect him, and use her skills in legillimancy (and occulancy?) to undermine Grindelwald's plans.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Does this theory with Abernathy make any sense, or could this be a plot hole in the film?

Sorry for any mistakes, this is only my third post on Reddit and I'm still figuring all this out! :)

682,teunteulai,1543836533,"1). The most important: one they showed us young Newt' holding a raven chick for a reason. Actually for two reasons: we can see it's the same bird that Credence found. And second, it is said that the raven is a symbol of the Lestrange family

2). Grindelwald is incredibly talented in transfiguration. At the beginning of the film he was using transfiguration, not the polyjuice potion (officially confirmed) to change looks with Abernathy for a quite long period, before the tongue was cut off, so he could possibly make a raven look like a phoenix.

3). Yusuf still has scars from Unbreakable vow, so Corvus is possibly still alive.

4). Corvus Sr. and GG knew each other, that's how GG learned about his identity. That's why they stole Lestrange family Tree and modified it, and they killed Irma Dugard. 

5). GG is almost always lying and would do anything to kill Dumbledore

6). Corvus Lestrange was shown as the last male Lestrange at the family tree, but we know that Lestrange continued to exist

So my thoughts are that the babies were double swapped, it means, they were swapped first before they went to the ship, because they were aware that Yusuf would try to kill them. Only the woman who was looking after real Corvus, knew that it actually is him, but she died as well.

-What was the purpose of the eye parasite? I understand that the character was a red herring,  but he could have been one without the parasite.

- I loved how Grindlewald is reminiscent of a orchestra conductor at the lastrange tomb when he was controlling the blue flames.

-we know that grindlewald is really good at transfiguration,  so what's the likelihood that he transformed the raven into a Phoenix? If the bird was truly a pheonix how could grindlewald speed up the process? Why wouldn't the pehonix transform sooner?

-I'm not 100% sure I believe that Ariana's obscurus is in credence. I thought that an obscurus was made when a child had to surpress their magic. When credence begin to feel ""wicked"" and holding in his magical abilities did it emit a signal that Ariana's obsucrus felt and it housed itself in credence?? That makes  no sense. Why wouldn't he have his own obscurus develop once he started to supress his magic? If her obscurus made it after she passed how did it wander around until it met credence? It just seems like a strech to me.  

- I love that queenie went with grindlewald, it makes for good character development.

- I wonder if there are more lines to the prophecy?

-When Nagini was turned into a horocrux was she still even alive. Its a little confusing to me because she tells Voldemort when the guy was listening to his conversation GoF , and when he says attack she does, but how is it possible to house two souls in one  body? Can a horocrux be a living person? 

- The way Tina looked at newt while he was taming Zouwus is just adorable.  She was so proud. 

- IMO when the blood pact was made grindlewald did it to save his own ass further down the line, but Dumbledored did it out of love. He didn't want to have to fight Dumbledore.

- As a black woman I'm glad there were more charcters of different ethnicities and cultures, but really....the black woman had to be drugged? I hope we get more of Madame picquery though. She is brave and no-nonsense. I enjoyed her.

- even though younger Mcgonagall doesn't line up with cannon, the actress played her well. 

- Lastly, if I can forgive JK for cosigning that monstrosity of a play, I can definitely ride with her through these twist and turns. What can I say....I love  her  wizarding world and can't wait until the next movie. If we're lucky we will get a longer movie the next go round and/or some mini series via pottermore. The next movie be years later and I'm not sure how she will fill us in over those lost years.

709,Potter924,1543622985,"Sorry for my spelling mistakes and my in (unstructured text). Secondly: 

\-Next movie we will be rio de janeiro which is close to the rain forest.  We know acromantula's live in rainforests of Southeast Asia, so probalby also a rainforest in Brazil.  So at some point we will see Newt getting an egg(maybe from a local shop, maybe he finds it in forest. At some point he will go back to hogwarts and **give the egg to hagrid**(because he see's that hagrid has an intrest in creatures.(this maybe happens at the end of third movie or in the 4th movie).  The 4th movie will be about the chamber of secrets. hagrid will get the blame and will almost be expelled, but Dumbeldore saves Hagrid as we all know. This is because **Newt would tell dumbeldore that an acromantula cannot do such thing**. However the fact if Newt will find out the creature is a basilisk that I am not sure off.  In the rainforest wee will see new creatures so not only recyled creatures from the HP-series.

\-Nagini: We will see nagini in the 3th movie I think, which will play out in 1938, we will see nagini meeting with Tom riddle, wich will build up to the cave scene where nagini will terify the other orphans. It's connects with the halfblood prince book/movie because we see a scene where Tom tells Dumbeldore that he can talk to snakes.  She will terify the orphans at the cave.(*I only need to find a reason yet for her to be there*) **The reason why nagini helps Tom is because she was a freak in the circus and Tom is a freak in the Orphanage.**  Tom will remind Nagini of Credence, because Credence is also a freak. Some people say that nagini is voldemort's mother. I don't think that is the case, but she will act like a mother. I think see will play sort of a mother role(without too much love).  I don't think we will see here at hogwarts but I think we will see here as a companion of voldemort in the 4th movie(1943) where we will witness the death of the riddle family. This takes place in August 1943, Myrthe is killed by the basilisk in June 1943. They can show both things in the same movie,in the 4th movie)  This is the same story/plot of the second movie, but instead of credence it's voldemort. I think nagini will be disgusted by the story of Tom riddle Sr. abandoning Tom.  I think this will be a moment where she doesn't trust muggles anymore.  So 3th movie: Tom meets nagini, tells he is an orphan and that he want to know his real parents. 4th movie: catches up with here again and they will go looking for his ancestory with the conclusion we all know from the books.

\-Credence: I don't think is Dumbeldore brother. I think Credence has an obscurus inside of him. I think credence is a Gaunt. I think the prophecy of the 10 year old boy who is an obscurus is actualy Tom riddle. That's the reason why Dumbeldore is visting the orphange because he  wanted to prevent the obscurus(*and if it is not the obscurus from the 1st movie, then it's just Dumbeldore trying to stop Grindelwald finding other obscuruses).* By letting Tom Riddle go to hogwarts the obscurus is never developed. Dumbeldore wanted to prevent Grindelwald finding Tom. The obsucurus inside Credence is Ariana's obscure. it's manipulated by Grindelwald.  **I think there is a chance of Credence dying in the 3th or 4th movie.** Credence will be killed by Dumbeldore(*Dumbeldore from the future is not the same as from the past, it's stated many times, that Dumbeldore character is less ""holy"" as wee see in the HP movies/books*) or one of dumbeldore followers. Or Grindelwald will kill Credence, but he will make it look like it is done by Dumbeldore. That way Grindelwald will get extra followers. It will be the start of the wizard war. Nagini will see this death, that way she will 100 prc go to voldemort or she will align with Grindelwald. Because she doesn't trust ""the good guys"" anymore.  Tom is the only one she can really go to because eventually she will become a snake for ever. One other theory  that I have is that credence will be killed by a No-maj/muggle, this is the best scenario to manipulated the wizard world that the muggle's are a threat.  This can be done by a bomb or a gun or something else. 

The movies will become progressivly darker they said. So the death of credence might be the direct cause of the wizard world war. 

Some people are saying that nagini will go bad because of the  ""malidictus curse"", but I think this is only partially true. There will be a turning point in the movie series I think, where she will go fully dark. 

And  I just wanted to tell I don't like the story of credence being a Dumbeldore.  I just think he has an obscurus inside of him implemented by Grindelwald. I think Credence is just a tool. I think in the best case he is just a gaunt, a distant relative from voldemort and that's why Grindelwalds senses he is a powerfull wizard(because it's a descendant from  a pure blood family) I would be dissapointed If they do not use nagini anymore. I think by putting here in the second movie they need to put here in the other movies aswell. I was quiet let down by the fact we saw so little of her charatcer arc, but there are still 3 movies left. 

\- I think we will see a dementor in the 3th or 4th movie.  A demontor is a creature itself, so it would fit in a ""fantastic beast movie"", also a patronus takes the form of a creature. And maybe Newt is a animagus.  So they can definitly put that in one of the movies.

714,GoldSkull25864,1543605611,"Whenever J.K. Rowling puts a prophecy into her stories, you can be pretty sure they mean something later in the plot, so I've been thinking about different things that The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus could mean. I have a few things, but first, here is the full prophecy for anyone who didn't catch it/doesn't remember. 

""*A son cruelly banished*  
*Despair of the daughter*  
*Return, great avenger*  
*With wings from the water.*""  


Meaning #1. 

I'm going to start with the most obvious one here. the son cruelly banished was Corvus and the despair was Leta's. The avenger is Yusaf and the wings from the water could be the water dragon parasite. That would mean the prophecy doesn't mean too much in the later movies, so I don't like it as much. Also, it says return great avenger, and Yusaf doesn't really return since we have never seen him before. 

Meaning #2. 

This one also has Corvus and Leta in the first two lines, but the next two lines are different. I think the avenger could be talking about someone avenging Leta's death, specifically Newt or Theseus. If it is Newt, the wings from the water could be the kelpie, who will come into play later in the story and its presence in CoG was setting up for a later movie. If it is Theseus, the wings from the water could be Newt and the kelpie collectively. 

Meaning #3. 

This one is my favorite. The son banished could be Grindelwald who was sent away to live with his aunt after being kicked out of Durmstrang. It could have been a cruel banishing. The daughter is Ariana, who was killed by Grindelwald. The avenger is Albus who wants to avenge his sister's death and wings from the water could be Newt with his kelpie who I think will play a pretty big part later on. 

Meaning #4. 

Each line could represent one of the first four movies with something bigger coming later to represent the last one. The first movie is Credence's movie, the main conflict surrounds him, and he could have been sent to America in a cruel way that we know later. The daughter is Leta who was sort of grieving all movie and eventually committed suicide/sacrificed herself at the end. She had a pretty good amount of despair I would say. The third and fourth movies are to come.

719,Ccdsz,1543562975,"A different theory (twins):

1 - It is unlikely that Corvus Sr. would have sent his beloved baby Corvus to the US with a maid, to be created in an orphange by Mary Lou.

2 - Leta Lestrange did not need to be on that boat; unlike baby Corvus, she was not in danger, as she was not loved by Corvus Sr.

3- Even if she was, Coruvs Sr. wouldn't care about her, and her being in the US would only give away the identity of baby Corvus, which was supposedly being hidden from Yusuf.

4 - Baby Corvus is probably alive because Yusuf still has the scars from the unbreakable vow.

5 - So the theory is that Corvus Sr. had twins, baby Corvus and a squib. No one knew about the squib, except perhaps the maid.

6 - He sent the maid with Leta and the squib to the US to be raised by Mary Lou.

7 - Everyone would have thought the baby on the boat was baby Corvus, because Leta and the maid were there with him.

4 - On the same boat, he sent true baby Corvus with his aunt, which would raise him in the US until fake baby Corvus was killed by Yusuf. She would then bring ture baby Corvus back claiming to be her son.

5- Corvus Sr. thought Yusuf would eventually trace down and kill the wrong baby in the US, thus the need for Leta and the maid to be with fake Corvus.

6 - But the accident happened and the babies were exchanged. The aunt eventually came back and told Corvus Sr. that baby Corvus had drowned, not knowing that that babies had been exchanged.

7 - He then mourned the death of his son, which he believed had drowned, and the knews of the death of baby Corvus were spread.

8 - Because there was no point in protecting the ""squib"" he despised, Corvus Sr. let the kid be raised by Mary Lou, and brought Leta back to England.

9 - He didn't know however that that kid was the true baby Corvus, because Leta had never told anyone she had switched the babies.

10 - In the dialogue between Dumbledore and Leta, he talks as if Corvus was dead. Yusuf also mentions that ""someone somehow took him out of the water"", meaning that the story that was told was that Corvus had drowned.

11 - Leda believed that was a false story created by her father to trick Yusuf, and that her father believed Corvus was still alive in the US (as she was the only one who knew about the baby exchange).

12 - Grindenwald was close to Corvus Sr., and heard the true story from his perspective: that Corvus had drowned and the squib survived and was in NY being raised as an orphan. That is why Grindenwald calls Credence a squib and doubts he could be the obscurian.

13 - After he finds out that Creedence is the actual obscurian, Grindenwald goes after the Lestrange book in Paris, and realizes what had happened. He then modifies the family tree to show only 1 dead son of Corvus Sr. called Corvus, and brings Leta and Credende to the Pere Lachaise, where the rumors about Credence being a Lestrange are proven to be false.

14 - That was necessary in order for Grindenwald to lead Credence into believing he was a Dumbledore (and to try to kill Dumbledore), while he is actually true baby Corvus.

15 - As to the squib, he probably did not die. He was saved by someone (or an animal? Horned serpent? Maybe the same animal that destroyed the boat) as Yusuf might have ""felt"" because of his vow. The fact that Dumbledore says the Obscurian needs a brother to replace the obscurus, and the fact that Leda died, also support the theory of twins. Also, we never see the actual baby, only the blanket.

Let's now match the story with the prophecy:

""A Son Cruelly Banished.""

Corvus was not cruelly banished, he was being protected. That reinforces the idea of twins: the squib was cruelly banished.

""Despair of the Daughter.""

That clearly refers to Leta.

""Return, great avenger.""

The squib will probably return in the movies. He was maybe raised as a muggle in the US, and we may see him fighting in WWII. Or maybe he actually had magical powers and was raised at Ilvermorny, and that's how we get to see the school.

729,32ndgoofball,1543519884,"So I have an idea regarding the big reveal at the end of crimes of Grindelwald. 
Spoilers ahead.

So the potter world is buzzing about the identity of credence. 
I don't believe it. Put simply it's Grindelwald telling him. 
Credence would be a fantastic weapon for Grindelwald to use. Make another person believe they are hated and going to be destroyed by the person you happen to want out of the way. 
 If I was a charismatic wizard bent on taking over the world with no one but albus dumbledor in my way...then yeah that would be my way to go about it if my goons were not up to it.

Canonically it makes no sense for credence to be dumbledor's brother. 
Kendra would have died years before Credence was even born and Percival died before her in Azkabahn so seems unlikely to be even a half sibling. 

Jk produced crimes of Grindelwald and I doubt she would have let a major timing error like that slip by. 

So who is Credence really? 

Well I have two ideas. 

First he could be no one and he has to accept that he can make himself into who he wants to be with out ever knowing this. It would be tough (and I bet there would be a fan uproar) but it could be a really heartfelt and mature plot line that does echo real life. 

Second.
 What if he's a Grindelwald? 
We know next to nothing about gelert Grindelwald let alone his family
This could explain why Grindelwald is so interested in credence and why credence is so powerful. 
An obscurous is born from a lack of love.
This struck me. If credence is gelert's brother then Grindelwald holds all the cards. He can manipulate credence without revealing his true heritage and also can keep depriving him of love. 
It's clear to see in the film he is only faining to love the boy. 
Or credence could be his son? But this seems a little bit twee for me personally.

Also from a purely visual perspective the filmmakers have gone to a lot of trouble to make them opposites in appearance and demeanour. 

The only sticking point I have is the phoenix at the end. Maybe someone else has a theory on that they would like to share as I doubt it would be a spell from Grindelwald. Though I would not put it past him to do something like that to fuel his lies. 

I have to admit before the film came out I was working on a theory that Fawkes the phoenix was potentially an embodiment of Grindelwald in some form similar to an obscurous but the info in the film quashed it. 

So throwing this out there. Anyone got any ideas or extra they want to add?

The opening sequence might be my favorite opening of any Potter film, alongside DH Part 1. The movie had an overall dark and beliebeable tone to it! It felt a hopeless, insecure. Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is phenomenal, and so is Jude Law as Dumbledore. 

The music is incredible. I especially noticed the music during the mirror scene with Dumbledore. It was extremely fitting and well made there. 

The conflicts felt...real. Many people say they didn't understand Queene's decisions in this movie. I however was totally on board with her character. She loves Jacob so much, she wants to be with him and is pretty much fooling herself by enchanting him. She's scared, confused, and angry at the world and how it is. And when Grindelwald ""agrees"" with her and offers a change - a change that allows her and Jacob to be free - in the world with a very convincing speech, I totally understand her.

I'm not blind to some of problems with the new series but the Potter books had their share of issues, too.

I don't know that I really have a point, except that for years I have wanted new content and now we have it and people are just shitting all over it. Meanwhile, I'm over in the corner watching and rewatching and devouring every page of the big illustrated books about these movies.

It's our harry potter tradition to watch it together in the theater.

But something strange happened. 40 minutes in or so, I thought, wait a minute, I actually like this movie a lot more then the first time. O lot of thing that I didn't understand the first time, I understood now.But still, there are problem with this movie, and the problems are JK's script mostly. I din't like how Yates did the action scenes, i always thought that he couldn't direct action very well. But this movie has so much in it, that you NEED to see it twice. But the problem is, why would someone see it twice if he didn't like it the first time ? With me, it was just  a coincidence. But I think you just need to see it twice to understand it better.

739,aauyi,1543475446,"In spite of all the things Grindelwald did, we  know he repented later in life. He died trying to stop Voldemort from going after the Elder Wand. So I think we can safely assume Grindelwald has some redeeming qualities...even though we are yet to see them. 

This got me thinking... is there a reason why Grindelwald had his followrs kill that Muggle couple and put them in a coffin? Voldemort would never put their victims in a coffin and bury them properly, right? And when Grindelwald finds the couple's baby, he gives the baby a long look, walks away and CLOSES the door behind him while his follower kills the baby.

I think this may be a subtle way of showing how Grindelwald was not thrilled about killing that baby. He didn't want to do it himself and he didn't even want to watch it, either. Kinda like, ""Okay this kid has to die but I don't want to stay and watch that.""

My friends and i had a blast with it and i think it definitely contributed to us enjoying the movie (despite some of us not digging all the more plotty elements). Some things we noticed:

\- The French Ministry of Magic was beautiful and felt weirdly inspired by our train stations. After seeing the British one - which is underground and had almost a ""cosy"" feeling in this movie's first scenes - and the very busy and extraordinary American one, i was slightly worried that they would start lacking ideas to make this new Ministry look good and different but Jo's imagination and the design team didn't disappoint, as usual.

\- The blasé attitude of the people working there, especially the woman who took Queenie's request of seeing Tina. She was so rude, like, ""ugh, tourists!"" In general i got some strong ""horrible administrative procedures"" vibes from the place, which made it funny because it's accurate.

\- On a similar note, the archives is most likely a thing that exists in all Ministries, BUT i was so happy to see it there specifically, because it's such a French thing to do, to meticulously keep and order tons of historical records lol. I kept thinking, ""hm, how very Francis I of them.""

\- Grindelwald's lady associate was captivating. I'm so curious about her. Is she his ""Bellatrix"" / right hand / lieutenant type? Was she just there for this film, to be his connexion in Paris sort of, or will she be back for more?

\- I saw the movie with subs and the fact that every person speaking French was actually very obviously a French person with a proper accent, even the  poor Muggle couple who's on screen for a few seconds, was so satisfying (sorry Americans/Brits, but there's nothing quite as annoying as Hollywood casting people who barely speak the language to play natives, i think Germans, Russians, Italians, the Chinese… we can all agree that the terrible pronunciation is often a big reality breaker.)

I wish we'd seen more of the Paris version of Diagon Alley, it  looked like it had a mix of medieval and art nouveau aesthetics, which gave it a feeling of being old and modern at the same time. (I now have my imagination set on it being the actual ""Miracle Court"" referred to in Notre-Dame.) I didn't really get how it worked though, compared to Diagon Alley, there were times where i didn't know if we were still in a ""wizard only"" area or not, so i'd be curious to see how they developped it, how big it's supposed to be… I can't wait  for the documentary they always do to talk about the set design, costumes, etc. Also for Nicolas Flamel's house, we didn't see enough of it!

* Theseus and Newt are like mirror to Tina and Queenie. **Theseus and Tina are the ""careerist"", doing the right thing by the right means, becoming an Auror, defending their values.** But Newt and Queenie are both driven by very personal drives. Newt went to the States and Paris not because Dumbledore told him to, not because Grindelwald was on the loose, but because he needed to save the Thundrbird and find Tina. Queenie, either as an undercover or out of her own will, sides with Grindelwald because of her love for Jacob.
* Leta and Corvus Jr are in fact mirroring Albus and Ariana (Let's put Aberforth aside for a moment cause we don't know how he will get involved in the moment). **Both pair has the older sibling being a ""taker"".** In the previous books, it was established that the young Albus thought his family was dragging him down, his sister was dragging him down, he was not able to shine BECAUSE of his family. Leta apparently couldn't get any love from her family, trying hard to earn some attention from her family and fellow schoolmates.  **Both of them have qualities that are detrimental to their younger sibling and consequently destroyed their siblings.**
* JK Rowling likes doing mirroring thing (not a literature major so don't understand much) like Teddy growing up as orphan was meant to mirror Harry, who lost parents in war. I wonder if the siblings situation is one of those?

DumbleLaw had 2 conversations with Newt and Leta respectively in this instalment about siblings. First telling Newt that if Credence had a sibling, he could be saved; and to Leta, about the rumours of killing one's siblings.

**SUPER CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD SPOLIER ALERTS** 

So, I 've been reading a lot about the ideas around the prophecy in Crimes of Grindelwald, and now I feel compelled to add to the many theories.

All of this is just theories my overactive brain came up with. Pure conjecture.

**THINGS I'M SURE OF** 

1. I think Grindelwald merely wants to use Credence as a weapon, considering that he can't move directly against Dumbledore. 
2. Not sure I buy Credence /Aurelius Dumbledore theory. We know Grindelwald is a master manipulator , and a skilled liar. He makes his rules as he goes along.  Consider the fact that he ""gives"" Credence a wand, when WE KNOW, the WAND chooses its master.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **THE PROPHECY:**

*A Son Cruelly Banished*

*Despair of the Daughter*

*Return, Great Avenger*

*With Wings from the Water*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do we even know if this the prophecy in its entirety? Given what we know of the world of Potter, I think it's possible that there's a vital bit missing. 
2. Like with Harry's own prophecy, I think it points to more than one person. 
3. Here's my pick of contender combinations that do not include Credence/Aurelius.

(i) **GRINDELWALD, ARIANA((?), AND ALBUS :**

What do we really know about Grindelwald? So far, there's been no mention of his family at all.   The closest I can think, is the hearse of the family killed in Paris, that Grindelwald stops to look at.  There is also the scene when he looks at the toddler, maybe an echo of his own childhood , before he was banished. Maybe they hold some link to tIt is possible then, that he is the son, banished from his family

The daughter in despair could potentially be Ariana.**OR.** This could be a reference to a mother/ sister of Grindelwald we are yet to meet

The Avenger,  **I  think is Albus.  Krall, in fact, refers to Albus as great, and we know he's working on building a resistance. T**he the only problem is the wings from the water. If it was wings made of fire, it would tie in with ideas of Fawkes and a Dumbledore in need.

&amp;#x200B;

(ii) **ALBUS DUMBLEDORE AND ARIANA** 

It is possible that Albus is the son cruelly banished. Maybe after the fight in which Ariana dies, Aberforth and Albus fight, and Albus is banished from the family.

The daughter in despair would be Ariana Dumbledore.

And finally, the avenger returning would be Dumbledore, with the resistance he is building. 

**Wings from the water** is problematic: Maybe though, it will take some form of water/potion to break the Blood pact, thereby giving Albus, the ""wings"" or power to face off against Grindelwald 

&amp;#x200B;

(iii) **GRINDELWALD, LETA LESTRANGE, NEWT SCAMANDER**  

The child, cruelly banished would be Grindelwald. We know zilch about his family, and it's fair to guess that he's the banished kid.

Leta Lestrange from we saw in the movie, is in despair. Part of that is because of the guilt over killing her brother. But, I feel like there's more to it, maybe we will learn more in upcoming movies. We also know that she has no real allies in the wizarding world, contributing to a maybe a sense of despair. Perhaps her despair is also over creating a distance between the Scamander brothers. Her last act, of standing against Grindelwald, is an act of desperation, plus he specifically states ""this one, I believe I know"". 

**BONUS POINT:  The family logo of the Lestranges is a Raven, as is the logo Grindelwald has chosen. His meeting takes place in the Lestrange family tomb. It looks like Leta, or at least Lestrange family are an important part of the prophecy.**

(iii) Newt as the unlikely Avenger: At the end of the movie, Newt who never picks sides, has chosen his.  We have the scene of a younger Newt caring for a baby raven, which ties again with the Lestranges and Grindelwald's own logo. In the first movie, Dumbledore deliberately sets him onto the path Grindelwald is on.  Newt in a sense ""returns"" to a war and societal conflict he distanced himself from.

**WINGS FROM THE WATER:** This particular series is as much about the Fantastic beasts, as it is about Grindelwald. Wings from the Water, in this case, could be a literal reference to a magical creature. Crimes of Grindelwald itself introduces us to two very specific water creatures 

1. The kelp, in Newt's possession -one that he learns to control,  and one he appears to ""almost rise out of the water with wings""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. The Japanese Water demon, in the Circus, that Credence and Nagini destroy.  Perhaps, like the Zouwu it too has escaped. It is entirely possible that Newt will find and rescue this creature, as well. Why else would J.K specifically have Newt identify it? Considering it all, I'd say Newt is the strongest contender, for being an Avenger, with wings from the water.

788,BourneHero,1543224935,"First of all, I want to say that even though I think the theory of Ariana’s obscurus finding a new host in Credence is the most likely scenario currently I do have some issues with it and want to propose a different possibility. I think the important part to take away from this is that there is a lot we truly do not know about how certain things work or the exact time lines of characters, both theories have issues, we can possibly learn from them, develop new ideas, and that they are simply theories, therefore it’s also highly likely neither are correct.

**NOTE: I HAVE A TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM IF YOU WANT TO SKIP DOWN THERE.**

**Let’s start by what we KNOW (more or less) to be facts:**

* Ariana was MOST LIKELY an obscurial who died in late summer of 1899 during a fight that Grindelwald, Albus, and Aberforth were involved in. While her being an obscurial is not confirmed it’s a very safe bet based on the description of her, the parallel between Creedence’s actions and how he’s described, and also the fact their names mean Silver and Gold in Welsh and Latin respectively. JK has been known to have origins and meaning for her names and while this could likely be a coincidence it seems a little too good to be true and suggests they are connected in some way.
* Credence is an obscurial who has lived significantly longer than any other in recorded history. In Leta’s flashback from 1901 it reveals she swapped Corvus Jr with Credence on the boat before it crashed, in turn resulting in Corvus’ and Credence’s Aunt’s death. This meant Credence was actually sent to America to be adopted by Mary Lou from Irma Dugard who was the Lestrange servant and thought she was giving up Corvus. This means AT BEST he could have been born mid-late 1900 but more likely at some point in 1901. The fact Credence is the oldest obscurial by 10+ years seems significant and could suggest he has strong heritage or it could merely be a coincidence.
* Grindelwald is a master at deception, not only by being extremely charismatic, but also in twisting the truth or even directly lying in order to help his cause.
* Grindelwald says Albus is Credence’s brother and his actual name is “Aurelias Dumbledore”.
* Kendra Dumbledore, the mother of Albus, Aberforth, and Ariana, died just before Ariana in the summer of 1899.
* Percival Dumbledore, the father of the three kids and wife of Kendra, was sent to Azkaban presumably around 1890 for seeking revenge on the muggle boys who harassed Ariana. He did not reveal to the ministry why he attacked them to protect Ariana and died in Azkaban.
* Honoria Dumbledore is the sister of either Kendra or Percival. It’s not confirmed who, but more likely Percival since Kendra’s parents were muggles.
* The Dumbledore legend is said that a phoenix will come to a Dumbledore in need. Credence is first seen with a chick after he has lost hope of finding out who he truly is when Irma Dugard is killed. Shortly after, Grindelwald is on the rooftop awaiting to speak to Credence. Credence is then shown with the chick at the end of the movie when Grindelwald reveals Credence’s lineage and the chick to be a phoenix.

**Problems I have with the shared obscurus theory:**

* Ariana died at best 6-9 months before Credence was even born. Since we don’t know much about obscurus’ there are a number of possibilities that could have happened that we just aren’t aware to be possible. For example, the obscurus leaving Ariana and finding a new host when she is killed, attaching to the host in the mother’s womb, or even manifesting itself into it’s own entity. Some of these explanations seem far-fetched to me but we will have to wait and see. Either way it seems the obscurus would have had to have been persevered for this to happen, and once it was persevered somehow make its way to a new host that would then be Credence. Since Grindelwald makes the comment in FBAWTFT about Newt’s obscurus being useless without a host and Newt appearing to be the only one knowledgeable enough to preserve an obscurus, it seems unlikely Grindelwald was able to accomplish this. It is possible Aberforth or Albus could have done it as a way to hold onto Ariana, but this seems problematic since they are aware of the destructive capabilities and were likely extremely distraught when their sister died.
* If Credence was effectively an obscurial from birth, why did it take him so many years in the orphanage where he was abused to start causing enough outbursts for other wizards to become aware of it? This can easily be overlooked as part of a plot convenience and in all honestly even with other theories this becomes problematic to a degree, but I think in this case it’s more relevant because he would have had many more years with it.
* While this is not truly significant and more a personal take/preference I feel that if Credence simply is the host of Ariana’s obscurus then it likely means that he as an individual person is insignificant. This to me is underwhelming for Credence as a character because I would like him to have some definite lineage that’s of some significance, whether or not that is as a Dumbledore.
* This assumes that the phoenix is able to tell the obscurus of Ariana resides within Credence despite him having no blood connection. There is always the assumption that Grindelwald used magic to make the chick appear to become a phoenix, but this doesn’t explain why it came to Credence in the first place. Unfortunately, the fact the chick came to Credence and then Grindelwald shows up shortly after suggests he could have “planted” it there as part of a master plan. However, this seems like A LOT to go through and I would rather assume the phoenix did come to Credence on it’s own accord.

**“My” theory:**

First of all I want to say this is not entirely my idea. I got it off a comment someone made in the SCB video review of the movie, but I unfortunately do not remember the user and cannot find their comment. In addition, in a sense this “alters canon” but in a way that I believe makes sense and is something that we do not have enough definitive information about for it to be considered guaranteed canon.

If we assume that what Grindelwald tells Credence is true, that he is Dumbledore’s brother then there are 2 possibilities, a true brother, or a half-brother. The true, blood brother is out of the question as Dumbledore never mentioned having a brother other than Aberforth and Kendra died in 1899. Since Kendra died in 1899 and the earliest Credence could have been born was mid to late 1900 that means the only way Credence could be a half-brother would be through Percival. But Percival is said to have died in Azkaban sometime after 1890… However, this vagueness of “sometime after 1890” is exactly what makes this intriguing. There is no definitive year of when he died and if he was a prisoner in Azkaban one would think the ministry would know when their prisoners died or at the very least have a better timeframe than “after (insert year)”. Now think back to the Dumbledore legend, “a phoenix will appear to a Dumbledore in need”. It seems reasonable to think that Percival being locked up in Azkaban for a cause as noble as avenging his daughter from those who abused her and refusing to say why he did so in order to further protect his daughter, would be a good time for such a family legend to play a part. So, let’s say the phoenix appeared to Percival while he was in Azkaban, what exactly does or could this mean? Well I think it could be 1 of 2 things, either the phoenix brings Percival something that allows him to escape Azkaban, similar to how Fawkes brought Harry the Sorting Hat in CoS, or that the phoenix was able to transport Percival out of Azkaban similar to how Albus escaped Hogwarts in OotP. From here, Percival ended up having a child with an unknown woman and for some reason the child was given up to Credence's Aunt (presumably Horonia, who was previously mentioned to most likely be Percival's sister) to be taken to America.

From here there are a few additional questions or things we must assume. First of all, if Percival escaped Azkaban, why was it said he died there? I believe there are two explanations, either he was able to convincingly fake his death or the ministry did not want to publicly announce his escape in order to maintain Azkaban’s inescapable status. The first option is tricky, but possible and the second option may seem unlikely since this was not the case with Sirius Black. However, I feel this cover up could occur because Percival’s crimes were not as serious, were not widely known by others, or put a significant individual (like Harry in Sirius’ case) in mortal danger. Second, if Percival did escape and had a son with another woman, how would Grindelwald have known or found out about this child? Especially since he obviously had no knowledge of the age or gender of the obscurial child in the first film. It is possible he could have discovered something while in prison in America if a guard somehow knew something, or even discovered it after escaping. This, to me, is the largest plot hole in the theory, however is one that could be filled in somehow since Grindelwald is so persuasive and appears to have many connections. Finally, it can safely be assumed that at some point in time Credence and Albus will meet up with Credence having the intention of wanting to kill Albus. This likely means Albus will become aware of the claim that was made to Credence about him being a brother. If this is the case and is true, why wouldn’t Albus ever mention Credence or his father not dying in Azkaban in the original series? I believe this can be answered in a couple ways, first of all that Albus does not consider Credence a brother since he’s a half-sibling and since he is a private individual to begin with sees no reason in mentioning it. As for his father, I think he would not mention anything in order to protect him and his story. Either Percival would have died since escaping or is still alive and needs his secret kept safe in order to protect him.

**TL;DR** – I’m not convinced Ariana’s obscurus resides in Credence because it would mean the obscurus would have a gap of about 1-2 years between hosts, it assumes the phoenix that comes to Credence can determine Ariana’s obscurus resides in him, it makes Credence the individual nothing more than a host for something bigger, and it doesn’t make sense that the obscurus wouldn’t lash out when Credence was growing up in the orphanage and being abused. Instead I suggest that Credence is Albus’ half-brother from his father Percival who escaped Azkaban with the aid of the phoenix from their family’s legend and then had a child with an unknown woman.

First post here. I’m french so feel free to make fun of me for my writing (or anything else).

I’d like to submit an Harry Potter theory to your attention. After watching Fantastic Beasts 2, I tried to understand how Aurelius could be related to Albus Dumbledore. My theory is quite dark so brace yourselves.

I do not believe Aurelius is Kendra Dumbledore’s son though it would be « almost possible » according to the dates : Kendra dies in november 1899, Credence/Aurelius was born « circa 1901 » from what I gathered. But Kendra, assuming she took her hubsband’s name, would not be a true Dumbledore, would she ?

Therefore, I came up with quite a dreadful theory : what if Ariana was raped by Grindelwald ? Aurelius would be a true Dumbledore. Plus, il would explain why Credence was able to master his Obscurus : he would be the very first biological heir of a previous Obscurus and this side of him would be « natural ». It would also explain why he is so powerful : biological heir of Dumbledore AND Grindelwald.

Finally, it could explain the dispute between Albus Dumbledore and Grindelwald and why the dark wizard fled Godric’s Hollow. It would also explain why Grindelwald knows so much about Credence. In the movie, I do believe he says to Credence that Albus is his brother, but let’s face it : would he really say « hey, dude ! By the way, I’m your father because I raped your mother when she was 12 » ? That wouldn’t serve his purpose (killing Dumbledore) really well now, would it ?

Here’s a link to the video, if you are interested:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Tq4UhzmqU

Obviously the love child bit doesn’t work with the timeline.

Let me explain the good part...

According to the theory, Credence is an homunculus.

We do know that homunculi exist in the Harry Potter world. In fact one makes an appearance in the first scene of FB2—the chupacabra. The chupacabra, according to the FB2 script, is “part lizard, part homunculus.”

Another important bit of this concerns an alchemist known as Paracelsus, the alchemist who introduced the idea of the homunculus to Europe.

Why is Paracelsus important? 

He’s a canon alchemist.

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, chapter 6, Paracelsus gets his own wizard card.

Secondly, we know from Order of the Pheonix, chapter 14, that there is a bust of him at Hogwarts.

His wizard card was also featured on Pottermore for a time. So JKR has clearly had him wandering around in the back of her mind for a while now.

But this is the more important part—alchemy will probably become more important as the series goes on with the inclusion of Flamel. Meaning the chupacabra will likely not be the only homunculus that we encounter.

So why would it be Credence?

Well the weird thing about Credence is that he doesn’t seem to die, and I don’t just mean the ending to the last film. An obscurus is a parasite. And when they run out of magic to feed on, their host dies. This death typically occurs when the host is really young. But Crendence is 26 years old, now. And he shows no signs of slowing down. If the last scene of FB2 is any clue, he has plenty of magic left in him. This has been a puzzle in the film. Though it might be because Credence is completely animated by magic, as an homunculus would be?

In terms of the timeline, this would work. Credence was born in 1901. This was in the time period in which Albus would have been doing the alchemical work with Nicolas Flamel that is mentioned on Albus’ wizard card. (Philosopher’s Stone, ch. 6)

Also, the name “Aurelius” is fascinating. It means “golden” or even “golden one.” Gold, of course, is one of the alchemical goals. Not only that, the alchemical symbol that we see on the card Albus gives Newt and on Flamel’s house is the symbol for gold. (See below)

Why would Credence be named Aurelius?

I can think of three reasons—one is that it was an afterthought on the part of Albus. Just naming him after the symbol for their group of alchemists. Another could be that Albus didn’t bother to name him at all and that Grindelwald just named him after the group’s symbol. Finally, it could be that the Stone played a fundamental role in the creation of Credence via transmutation. After all, gold in alchemical symbology is that of uncorrupted life and immortality. A goal for Albus, a desperate hope for Ariana and the seeming unkillable character that is Credence.

At any rate, I would not be surprised if the creation of human homunculi was illegal or heavily regulated, much like stem cell and cloning research in our world. Perhaps that’s why Albus sends Credence to the “maiden aunt” mentioned in the script to be put up for adoption? It was an attempt on the part of Albus and the “maiden aunt” to get him as far away as possible. Perhaps, even this is why he was given to the Barebone family in the first place, to keep the secret hidden and repressed away? Perhaps so little is known about human homunculi that Albus never expected this to create a Obscurus?

So why is he a Dumbledore?

Well... this is were it gets gross and really disturbing. One early theory in biology is that sperm carried small bodies, known as animalcule, that would grow inside the womb of a woman, becoming an infant. Alchemists, just as the majority of the ancient and medieval world, thought that the woman played no fundamental role in procreation beyond incubation and so believed that a human could be created by inserting sperm into other creatures—usually dead cows and horses. The homunculus would then incubate for forty months, or so, all the while being fed with the alchemist’s blood on a regular basis. (Yet another magical use of blood potentially connected to Albus.) The homunculus would then be the offspring of the alchemist.

If this is true, then the “maiden aunt” that brought Credence to America would likely be Honoria—Albus’ unmarried aunt mentioned in The Tales of Beetle the Bard (and arguably Credence’s great aunt by virtue of the introduction of Albus’ blood to the forming homunculus).

So where does the obscurus come in?

The answer to this is simple. Credence’s entire body is animated not by a soul, but by magic, magic that he had to suppress all of his life. It would be no wonder that Credence is such a powerful Obscurial.

Why was Albus trying to make an homunculus in the first place?

I can think of two possible reasons, both concerning Ariana. We know he was distraught over losing her. We even learn in Deathly Hallows (ch. 35) that even when Albus found the Resurrection Stone in the summer of 1996, he was still searching for a way to bring back Ariana. Ironic, considering that he was constantly telling Harry that “no spell can bring back the dead.” Apparently Albus didn’t believe himself.

Perhaps Albus created an homunculus as an experiment, to see what it would take to create a life in an attempt to bring one back—Ariana? Or perhaps Albus believed that the homunculus would be like an empty shell which he could use to resurrect Ariana into?

What about the prophecy of Tycho Dodonus?

Well it still fits. “Son cruelly banished,” is Corvus V. “Despair of the daughter,” is Leta’s despair over what she did to her brother. “Return great avenger with wings from the water,” is Credence, who narrowly escaped drowning on the sinking ship and is now after Albus.

Why, then, is he called Albus’ brother?

Because Credence was viewed his whole life as a freak, likely why he was so taken with Nagini who worked at a “freak show.” All he wanted was a family who loved him, only to find out he was created in an alchemy lab. That would likely throw him into despair, not into the rage that Grindewald needs him to be in to go after Albus. Grindewald needs him to believe that one of his last remaining family is looking for him. Not out of love, but out of fear of him and who he is. Just as Credence’s abusive adopted mother was.

Why else is this cool?

In terms of themes, focusing on the mystery of life in FB2 (something that homunculi and other alchemical themes, like the elixir of life, really lend to; not to mention fantastic beasts) in contrast to the focus on the mystery of death that we see in HP and Beedle the Bard would seem like a nice contrast. Perhaps when we consider the Cursed Child along with this, we can see the three mysteries of the Department of Mysteries. Prophecies concern the living of life—representing the unfolding narrative of Fantastic Beasts. The veil of death—Harry Potter. And the time turners—the Cursed Child.

TL;DR Credence might be an homunculus created by Albus.

[In the first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sEaYB4rLFQ), there are some slightly altered lines such as Newt's ""No, we're going somewhere"" or the minister's ""There's a rumor that Newt Scamander is heading to Paris"", as well as the shot with the deluminator taking the lights out of some street lamps, but those seem to be just minor cuts to some scenes. But then there is the ones that seem to be from completely different scenes, like Credence letting the Obscurus out on the rooftop with Nagini and the ballroom scene with Leta Lestrange, as well as the two shots we get of Yusuf staring at the Lestrange family tree (presumably where we were supposed to get the misdirect that Credence is Corvus) and Tina coming to confront him.                         


[In the second, Comic-Con trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvFybpmyB9E), we get more shots of the deluminator, Credence releasing the Obscurus and the ballroom scenes respectively, which makes me think these were late cuts to the movie. The only shots I could identify as being new to the trailer but not in the movie were Credence staring at the posters for Nagini's show and Grindelwald walking to the left in front of a bookcase (that one might've been in the movie, but I don't recall it). Lastly, we see Newt when Kowalski is talking to Nicolas Flamel, indicating he was also supposed to be in that scene, however because he is in a completely different shot than either of them, it's possible that this was just a spliced in shot from another scene in the house.              

And there was no scene that I could find not in the final cut of the film in [the last trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bYBOVWLNIs). Perhaps we could see an extended cut of the movie when it comes to Blu-ray including some of these cut scenes, or at least we can hope for it. I'd have to guess that at least the ballroom and Credence on the rooftop scenes were fairly late cuts since they were in the Comic-Con trailers and would've presumably allowed for more character development for Credence, Nagini, Leta and possibly Theseus.",FantasticBeasts,Some Possible Cut Scenes from The Crimes Of Grindelwald,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/a0c8wb/some_possible_cut_scenes_from_the_crimes_of/,1543150259.0

812,Hanelise11,1543159654,"After watching the first movie countless times and the second twice, I’ve started to wonder something based on how the Elder Wand’s allegiance can change.

In the first movie, we see Newt distract Graves with the Swooping Evil and then restrain him, this causing Graves to drop his wand. Tina then accio’s the wand to her. As could be seen, Graves isn’t carrying the Elder Wand, but rather another that was made to fit his character. This wand, in turn, is taken.

In the second movie, we see Grindelwald has the Elder Wand. As we know from HP canon, Malfoy disarming Dumbledore leads to the allegiance changing to Malfoy. Then, Harry disarms Malfoy, changing the allegiance of Malfoy’s wand to Harry, and thus changing the allegiance of the Elder Wand to Harry, as well.

IF it’s simply disarming the person (not necessarily using a spell), wouldn’t that follow that both Graves’ wand and the Elder Wand now have allegiance to Newt? Or does one have to be disarmed through a spell or killed to change the allegiance? Obviously we know Dumbledore ends up with the Elder Wand through Defeating Grindelwald, but what about this in between time?

Is there anything established already in canon that allows for accurate holographic-esque visions of the future? The way it is presented appears to be a direct transmission of footage from the actual event. Certainly more than a verbal prophecy.

Secondly as to the content, I've seen people that seem to think it makes no sense that Grindlewald would do a bit of a moral 180 and condemn Muggles for future mass violence when he is fine with it himself (as shown about 5 minutes later). Aside from the fact it meant to show his hypocrisy, I think it's refreshing to finally see wizards taking muggles as a threat seriously.

European wizards seem clueless about the muggles capacity for violence, a gun being a 'sort of metal wand' used to kill people. The original books handwave muggles away as stupid, or not anything to worry about. US wizards on the other hand take them seriously, and IMO it's great that they finally address the technological capacity for muggles to destroy life on the planet (and by extension, wizards). I find it difficult to believe that after Hiroshima  happens that European wizards would continue along blithely but I'm happy they are finally not ignoring this aspect. I hope they continue to explore it as WWII draws closer.

824,jokerofish,1543119893,"I've seen the movie twice and read through the script book once and these are the theories and observations that I have.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Skull**

The skull isn't really described in much detail in the script, it only says that it is a skull-shaped hookah, it glows and that Grindlewald exhales vapours that form a vision. In the movie we see the skull is inscribed with ""for the greater good 1898"" That's a weird inscription as ""for the greater good"" is the motto Dumbledore would create for Grindlewald in 1899 so the slogan is presumably added after, the date is presumed to be the date the skull is created. 

My theory; The skull is either an artifact Grindlewald found/made when he was 15 that creates visions of the future. When he used it, it showed him the path to his victory was via an obscurus.  We know Grindlewald, by the age of 16 was expelled from Durmstrang for near fatal attack/""experiments"" on fellow students - I believe these ""experiments"" were his attempts to turn a classmate into an obscurus. 

When we see him using the skull the first time it shows an obscurus that forms into Credence - perhaps the skull confirming Credence is the specific obscurus he seeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Obscurus**

This one is a pretty commonly held theory so I wont spend too much time on it. In the first movie script book an obscurus is described as a ""Parasitical magical force"" that children are said to ""develop."" As well, Newt has managed to separate one and it is ""useless"" without a host. All implying that an obscurus is an independent creature. We also know there use to be more obscurus but when wizard separated from the muggle world they began dying out. Credence's obscurus is the same obscurus that latched onto Ariana. Aberforth, who knew best how to calm his sister down named the obscurus Aurelius so Ariana wouldn't have to acknowledge she was doing magic.  Grindlewald, who was already looking for an obscurus by that point, began planning to take Ariana with him and Albus on their quest and formed  a blood pact with Dumbledore so he could never attack Grindlewald when he discovered the true plan he had for Ariana.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Family Tree**

So, here's a fun fact. When you see Rosier and Abernathy in the french ministry when they already had the family tree- when they're entering the ministry. It's clear in the script book that the main entry to ancestry record room is down 3 floors from the main floor according to Newt. Leta enters the room from the 2nd floor according to the movie (it's unclear  in the script book but she is above them) the reception and entry is on the main floor. 

When Queenie is at the reception desk we see Abernathy in disguise walk onto the elevator and join Rosier who pulls out the family tree and then we see the elevator move. So we know the two brought the family tree into the building before going to a different floor in the ministry. 

When Leta goes to the record room (fun fact to destroy the family tree) she finds a note from Grindlewald saying the records had been moved to the family tomb where Grindlewald has already invited Credence so it can be revealed in front of the boy the corvus is ""dead""

Though, I am admittedly confused why Grindlewald's followers snuck the book into the ministry only to remove it - unless the delete party scene shows Leta finding the family tree and looking at it, confirming corvus is dead first before the book was removed by Grindlewald's followers (knowing she would destroy it) to the family tomb and that story-line got cut for time.

826,miba54,1543112551,"The one talked about plot of CoG has been that the Elder Wand should have resisted Grindelwald because it supposedly belongs to Tina since she summoned the wand at the end of the first film.

In my opinion, this isn't a plot hole at all. And I think there are two reasons for it.

First, at the end of the first film, Grindelwald wasn't disarmed. By anyone. He simply dropped his wand. Here is an excerpt from the script:

&gt;  Out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around Graves like a whip. Graves tries to hold it off as it tightens, but staggers, struggles, and falls to his knees, dropping his wand.
&gt; 
&gt; TINA

&gt; *Accio.*

And second, Tina merely summoned the wand. She doesn't disarm Grindelwald with the Expelliarmus spell, which we know transfers the allegiance of a wand to the caster of the spell.

It's been some years since I read the books and I'm not that knowledgeable on Potter lore, but I don't think simply summoning a wand makes you its master.

The movie did have its flaws, sure, but I don't think this was one of them.

1. Limit the beasts: the kelpie, kappa, lizard, parsite, cats, lion dragon are varying degrees of unnecessary. Maybe only keep the lion dragon, nifflers, kappa (since it was so background). Then you have several beasts, which Newt's expertise greatly helps with. 

2. Make Newt traveling to Paris to free the Lion Dragon, and Dumbledore wants to tack on his mission, the ministry wants to tack on theirs. He doesn't want to take sides, only help the beast. While visiting the Circus, he thinks he sees Credence. (This streamlines the front of the movie, and makes the beast his main motive.)

2.5. His brother is there with Leta to track Grindelwald. Most of the movie is in Paris. 

2.6 Tina is on a secret mission: it's revealed later Credence survived and she's tracking him. 

3. Queen, Jacob and Tina are there together. We see Tina and Queenie fall out, we see Queenie cast a spell on Jacob. They argue she runs off into the crowd. Newt is worried about her actions.

4.They are now trying to find Queenie, as well.

6. Tina is following Leta. She informs Newt of Letas supposed connection. This is when the audience learns Tina's mission. Newt flashesBack to his perpsceptive. (Maybe takes Tina into a Pensieve).

7. All the threads take them to the tombs. Leave out most of the French ministry of Magic. They are suprised by Leta. She tells her secret. Finally following Queenie, they find the secret meeting. No Nicholas Flamel. 

All in all. Refocus it on Newt and Tina. Make the Lion Dragon Mcguffin  for Newt. Credence Mcguffin for Tina. Streamline much of the story. More mystery is in the background, increasing rewatchablility.

842,xiaomaea,1543081490,"So I’m much more interested in theorizing how McGonagall’s placement in FB:CoG is a purposeful move by J.K. Rowling than in bemoaning how it must have been some sort of timeline mistake, even if I turn out to be wrong. It’s fun trying to come up with a theory encompassing everything we know about McGonagall, and I have yet another wild theory to contribute out into the Internet ether as to how this all might work. In fact, it’s probably out on the Internet somewhere, as we’re all brainstorming this stuff simultaneously, and if you’ve seen some variation of what I say below, please let me know, or link to it in the comments! I’d like to know. There's a very short summary at the end of this post, if you don't wish to read it all.

I’m going to start way back when I think McGonagall might have been born, around 1905-1906 (which would make her about 21 or 22 in FB:CoG). She looked young in the film, but people at that time period were also a lot more mature and poised in their culture at younger ages, so the approximate age works for me.

We know a lot from the Pottermore account written by J.K. Rowling. Minerva received her letter to Hogwarts at 11, which would put the timeline at about 1916 for her arrival at Hogwarts. The muggles are still in the middle of the European Great War, but Minerva’s home is in the Scottish Highlands, and Hogwarts is also secreted away in Scotland, so it’s unlikely that they are affected dramatically or drastically by World War I.

We know that she is a Hatstall who becomes a Gryffindor (who very nearly was a Ravenclaw) and that with the help of Albus Dumbledore, who was her Transfiguration teacher (note: in this case, Dumbledore was teaching Transfiguration much earlier than 1927!), she was able to become an Animagus: the distinct form of a tabby cat with spectacle markings we see her as in the very first HP film, when she is scoping out the muggles who are to become Harry’s adoptive family. Bear with me, that’ll be important. But back to her school career.

She graduates around 1923, which is also the year she takes a bad fall with the Gryffindor Quidditch Team, and despite not being able to play any longer, she has the trait of being an avid and lifelong devotee to her House Team, especially as it regards beating Slytherin.

She falls for Dougal McGregor, refuses him, and heads off to the ministry for two years, 1924-1925, and then, missing Scotland, returns to Hogwarts having been accepted into a Transfiguration post there, and immediately, no less! They must have had a very high regard for her, or at least Dumbledore does, as she’s working under his Head of Transfiguration position.

As Minerva is the new Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore no longer needs to teach it (and I know that in Harry’s world, both Trelawney and Firenze take Divination classes, so I suppose it’s possible that Dumbledore and McGonagall were both teaching Transfiguration, but Firenze was given the post to protect him from his herd, so I think it more likely that Minerva was the only Transfiguration teacher), and this is why we see him teaching DADA in FBCoG in the year 1927, when Minerva has been teaching for approximately two years. Both the students and Dumbledore call her “Professor McGonagall” and seem to respect her as a full-fledged teacher, so I don’t think she is a student teacher or anything less than the Transfiguration teacher at this time.

But now I’m considering the war with Grindelwald, which is just starting. Dumbledore is the one man who longs to do something about it but cannot, due to his blood pact with Gellert. We also know that he places great trust in Minerva McGonagall, giving her a teaching post, having helped her become an Animagus, aware of her prodigious skill.

Remember when Newt Scamander tells Dumbledore that he, Newt, was able to get the vial (Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s blood pact) because of a Niffler, a creature that Grindelwald doesn’t regard very highly, and thus, underestimates. Is it possible that, as a new professor and relatively unknown to Grindelwald at this point, Minerva McGonagall is put to work as a spy – in her Animagus form – under Albus Dumbledore’s orders or the orders of The Order of the Phoenix? As a small, ordinary animal unknown to Grindelwald, at least at first, he might not think her so important, or even recognize who or what she is.

She ceases to become a Transfiguration Professor for some time, both to keep out of the limelight and to work undercover as much as possible. She’s brave. She’s a Gryffindor, and she would probably hate to be shunted out of the way when people are doing things to try and bring down Grindelwald, so I'm certain she would have wanted to do something and be involved. She could do this. It'd be in her nature.

We know that McGonagall did just this sort of surveillance work in a low-key sort of way just after Voldemort’s first defeat, and we hear her say she’s been watching the Dursley house “all day”. She could have been called in to watch Harry's family for just this sort of work - because she had done it before: spying on Grindelwald and his allies.

So Minerva McGonagall functions as a spy for around 15 years, depending on when she stopped teaching and began to work with Dumbledore and his allies in earnest, in a kind of Cold War against Grindelwald.

After Grindelwald’s defeat, there’s a gap of nine years, from 1945 to 1954 that can’t be accounted for, and I have no idea what Minerva could have been doing at this time. She had an old Quidditch injury that might have gotten in the way if any of the fighting in Grindelwald's War got physical for her. It’s possible the War against Grindelwald takes its toll on her, and whatever ends up happening between Queenie and Jacob could remind Minerva very much of what could have happened to her and Dougal McGregor, the muggle she refused to marry, but still loved with all of her heart, only Minerva is watching from the opposite side of the aisle from Queenie during Grindelwald’s Rise to power and subsequent takedown. I could never see McGonagall as siding with Grindelwald, and Minerva and Queenie would make such a beautiful parallel! Only, Queenie (hopefully?) gets to be the one with a possible happy ending, because we know that McGonagall never has that happy ending with her \*first\* love.

In 1956 McGonagall finally takes up teaching again, and continues for 39 years, as she so famously states to Umbridge in Order of the Phoenix (HP book 5). She’s telling the truth. She wouldn’t lie, as a Gryffindor, as honesty would be very important to her, even if she concealed some of the details. She’s been teaching continuously for thirty-nine years. She just doesn’t mention the fact that she had taught Transfiguration before that, as well, with a lot of large gaps and events in between - and she isn’t likely to, being an intensely private person who isn’t too well known by anyone, with the exception of Dumbledore, and perhaps Urquart, whom she finally marries shortly after Voldemort’s first defeat.

This all fits for me, because I see McGonagall very much like the actress Maggie Smith, from the films, a witch who, when hit by stunning spells trying to help save Hagrid from arrest by Umbridge, would have been at an age when, for a wizard (and wizards live considerably longer lives than muggles), her heart giving out from such an injury could be a concern. It’s much more plausible in my mind that she was a 90-year-old witch in 1995 - more plausible than a 60-year-old witch who would have been a bit heartier than a muggle at that age.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:dr: I think McGonagall was a very young 21- or 22-year-old professor in 1927 who later ceases to be a teacher, goes on to spy on Grindelwald as an Animagus, possibly under Dumbledore’s (Or the Order of the Phoenix’s) orders, and does so for some time, until resuming her Transfiguration teaching post after the War against Grindelwald and WWII in the year of 1956, thus making her statement to Umbridge that she had been teaching continuously for 39 years absolute truth.

In the scene in the tombs where Leta attacks Grindelwald, a green light comes from her wand and the move is blocked by Grindelwald. Aside from the fact that the curse should be unblockable, Leta is clearly capable of using the curse properly so there is no reason for it to not have worked?

848,iamwizkid,1543037647,"I watched CoG last week and have never felt more heartbroken that a movie like that is getting such negative reviews. When I read what people complained about, I felt that most people missed the whole point. I'll go through some of the complaints. Warning: there are spoilers.

Unnecessary plotlines. 
There's Newt and the constant pressure from his surroundings (the Ministry, Dumbledore) to go to Paris and find Grindelwald. He finally does go but only because Tina is there and it's no coincidence that she's exactly where Grindelwald is so he goes to make sure she's okay because he loves her. I believe this was the main plot. Jacob's urge to find Queenie served as a good reason for him to join the adventure with Newt else it would seem dumb for him to fall into such dangerous situations. Queenie's desire to be happily united with Jacob leads to her being convinced by Grindelwald and that twist honestly is a very interesting plotline moving forward, in my opinion. Credence and his search for his origin with Nagini serves to show the reason why Credence finally sides with Grindelwald at the end. Leta Lestrange and her back story almost led us to believe that Credence is her long lost brother (misdirection). But that's not all. Her back story makes the final scene where she basically suicides to save the others more believable. It gave her character so much depth I personally loved her. It may seem like a lot but notice that all the plotlines intertwine and story wise don't go too far to lose you. All the character's current positions were set up in this movie and I don't know what one wants more in a part 2 of a 5 part series. Note that the first movie didn't set up the story. We only were introduced to the characters but we needed a movie that starts the actual story and this was perfectly delivered by CoG.

Messy. 
So we did jump from one plotline to another but the characters and their locations were very different. Music was also different so it wasn't too difficult to keep up. This movie packed a lot to watch once but thats what I like about it. We got so much new information about the wizarding world that I was constantly at the edge of my seat taking in every little bit I could get. Side note tho: The music in this movie is amazing, try listening to it. It's very nice but I digress.

Plot holes. 
Yeah...not going to defend this as much. There were little things that were wrong (Accio niffler..?). But not the big twists. There were just as many small plot holes that any normal movie has. In fact, if you over-analyze things you are going to find plot holes in the first Harry Potter movies as well. You can read through this entire subreddit about theories that still work with the information we have and the information we got in this movie. You have to give J.K. Rowling time to explain. She knows how to tell a story and this confusion right now is exactly what she wanted.

Out of character decisions. 
In my opinion, nobody behaved out of character. Newt was reluctant to go to Paris and only went for Tina. When there, he was only interested in the animals (the zouwu, that eye infection thing) and helping Tina. He only finally decided that he will be a part of this fight because of everything that went down in that graveyard and that makes sense. I read complaints that there's no fun when Newt was simply explained where Grindelwald and Credence are rather than anyone having to find out in the movie. It makes sense. He was never part of the fight or the investigation and never wanted to be. The Aurors were, so obviously they would know. The investigation isn't an important part of the story. And how about Queenie being convinced by Grindelwald to be on his side. She's a mind reader. This only proves that not only is Grindelwald extremely dangerous but also believes in what he preaches. If he was lying Queenie would have caught it but she didn't. And why didn't Queenie just move to Europe with Jacob so they could be happily married? Well if you were given a choice between getting a basic human right for yourself or fighting for everyone's human rights (for ""the greater good""), would you not take the latter option? Queenie being the sister of an auror would definitely take that option. Leta Lestrange, only acted in character. The entire time she was tortured by her own guilt that she killed her brother, that at the end she gave up trying to be happy but instead sacrificed herself for the people she cares about. It's impressive how much we know about her given that she was introduced in this movie.

Maybe the flaw of the movie was that SO much information was packed in 2 hours and that may not be a good quality of a movie but for a story it was brilliant. No character was left untouched (you even get a glimpse into Nagini's character by her decision at the end of the movie). It's a movie that definitely requires a second watch to truly understand and appreciate all the details. There wasn't any lack of beautiful looking (and sounding) scenes, intense moments and gasp-worthy plot twists. (I actually gasped when the niffler  revealed it got the blood pact). It didn't end on a hopeless note (like Avengers: Infinity Wars) and gave the viewers a lot to look forward to in the upcoming movies. 

Pls correct any of the details if I got it wrong, I only watched the movie once. And wow thanks for reading this far.

850,witty0985,1543036189,"What if, with a blood pact, Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s lives become entwined with each other. In COG it shows their blood becoming one. That has to be significant.. I don’t see a blood pact being like a horcrux or something dark. But something that links two people together, almost like a magical marriage of sorts. I wouldn’t be surprised if it can’t be destroyed.  So maybe it’s not that they CANT fight, but that because of their pact, if one harms the other it harms both. If you kill the other, you kill yourself. What if this duel that Dumbledore wins, isn’t him defeating GG with superior magic,  but he can take this pain inflicted upon them both, with each spell cast against GG and himself, longer. The pain that he feels that He deserves for the death of Ariana. He wins this duel not with breaking a bond made out of love, the blood pact, but out of a stronger love he realizes he has for Ariana and Aberforth and people in general. He can take the pain for those he loves. The pain he feels he deserves for turning his back on his family to pursue power with Gellart. Until at last Gellart realizes there is no way to defeat Dumbledore, who has so many he loves. Not willing to die for the movement he started, only loving himself,  Gellart concedes. So a series that begins with a boy who is in an orphanage not loved, ends with a selfless man fighting  the man he loves for the people he loves. Saving them all, through his pain, for a greater good. Showing what love is. Showing Credence what love is, in turn (if you believe his obscuris is Ariana) how much he loves Ariana. Destroying the Obscuris because it now feels love that it didn’t feel before. Dumbledore mentions an obscuris manifesting in the place of love. I would be surprised to see Credence and the obscuris separates by love. He’ll see a determined Dumbledore out of love. This love will free Credence and defeat Gellart all in one. The elder wand chooses Dumbledore because it sees him stronger because he didn’t submit in the duel. And in the end, a blood pact made out of love, becomes the way he defeats Gellart,  as opposed to something that would prohibit him from doing so.

855,gh0st-ed,1543024808,"So I just watched the new Fantastic Beasts last night in theaters and I have...lots of thoughts. Most of which have probably already been voiced but the one thing I haven't seen too many other people talking about is the representation of Dumbledore and Grindelwald. 

Dumbledore is supposed to be a mysterious, whimsical, and eccentric person. I don't think Jude Law's portrayal of him was *bad,* just not accurate. I felt Dumbledore came off as just this cool and well-liked Professor who was pretty good at magic. We needed to see the REAL Dumbledore, the one that we got to know in the original Harry Potter series. He was too ordinary in this new movie. 

Second, I have always imagined Grindelwald to be more like the Joker in the sense that he's pure evil and also a little crazy. All the glimpses we saw of him in the original Harry Potter books seemed to prove this (him jumping off the windowsill, his last moments before Voldemort kills him, and so on). In the movie, he was like freaking Jack Frost. Cold, closed off, and not at all cool, he didn't appear evil only manipulative and somewhat bad. Grindelwald is supposed to be powerful and dangerous and just this pure evil person consumed by his own desire for a Pureblood world. I was so incredibly disappointed with this portrayal of him. And while we're on that note, I couldn't see Depp as Grindelwald...I just kept seeing as Johnny Depp with lots of makeup on. 

All in all, the movie had lots of issues but this bothered me the most. Thoughts? What did you think of how they were portrayed in the movie and how did you envision Grindelwald to be?

They had clothes that looked like it was from another generation but also kind of eccentric. I'm not saying everyone should  be in robes but their clothes should have some flare. Just look at Gilderoy Lockhart, Mad-eye Moody or Rita Skeeter!

A lot of the guys in COG looked like Peaky Blinders or just wore plane boring suits, I think that's why I couldn't see Jude Law as a young Dumbledore. He just looked like a guy and didn't really give off the vibe of the person we know he's going to become. It's a shame because simply putting some more effort into the wardrobes could have made such a big impact.

868,IntriguedLinguist,1542998520,"In the second movie, Grindelwald tells Credence that he is actually Albus Dumbledore's brother, Aurelius Dumbledore. But this seems impossible for a few reasons: a) Dumbledore's mother dies in 1899, and b) Dumbledore's father is in Azkaban until his death (as far as we know). However, we know that Credence was an infant in 1901, when the shipwreck takes place. So we know that Credence *cannot* be Albus Dumbledore's true brother. Some people have suggested that Credence may be Ariana's son, but Ariana herself died in 1899, making this impossible as well. 

This leaves one logical possibility: Credence is Ariana's obscurus--her dark twin--attached to a new human host. This is problematic though, because it still begs the question: If Ariana died in 1899, how did her obscurus exist without a host until Credence's birth (around 1901)? Well, we know that an obscurus can be made to live without a host, as shown by Newt in the first movie. It could be possible that upon Ariana's death, Grindelwald was somehow able to contain the obscurus in a similar way. Grindelwald immediately fled following Ariana's death, and what he did afterwards is unknown.  

**I think it's possible that Grindelwald fathered a child, with the intention of using it as a host for the Ariana's obscurus.** This would make sense, timeline-wise, because if Ariana dies in summer 1899, and this child is conceived in the months following, it could have been born in mid-late 1900, or early 1901. It also makes sense for a number of other reasons: 

* Credence somehow makes it to adulthood, despite the obscurus. If it isn't his own obscurus, perhaps he is capable of having more control over it/it has less effect on his physical state.
* The Ariana's obscurus makes Credence her literal ""dark twin"", explaining why a phoenix is drawn to Credence.
* Grindelwald *bestows* a name upon Credence, naming him, as a father would name a son. 
* The name ""Aurelius Dumbledore"" is his birthright, because to Grindelwald he is Ariana's dark twin, Albus Dumbledore's brother. 
* The name ""Ariana"" means silver, and the name ""Aurelius"" means gold. 
* Given that Grindelwald's character is known to be incredibly persuasive, it wouldn't be too shocking if he were able to seduce a woman into bearing his child. 
* This could explain why Credence was on a boat headed to the United States: if his mother (or a relative) became aware of Grindelwald's intention to imbue Credence with this kind of evil, she may have been compelled to flee and hide the child from him. Based on the woman's (said to be his aunt) reaction to the baby's drowning, she clearly cares for the baby deeply, so her fleeing to protect the baby would make sense.
* If Grindelwald then finds out about the shipwreck, he would likely believe that his child had perished, seeing as he is unaware of the swap made by Leta. This would explain why he travels to the United States, in search of the powerful obscurial tormenting NY. He doesn't realize this is his own son, now an adult, who he thinks perished in 1901. He focuses on Modesty, a girl who is much younger than Credence, for this reason. Grindelwald then puts the pieces together, explaining why he is the only one who knows and understand Credence's true identity (if his mother perished in the shipwreck). 

If this theory is correct though, an important question remains: Who is Credence's mother? I'm not sure about this, but I think it may have something to do with the Rosier family. [Vinda Rosier](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Vinda_Rosier) is a follower of Grindelwald in the new movie, and seems to feature quite strongly although she is kept fairly mysterious. The Rosier's are one of the Sacred twenty-eight families, which would be an obvious choice for Grindelwald and his obsession with pure-bloods. We also know that Grindelwald is heavily inspired by Adolf Hitler, who was rumoured to have fathered an illegitimate son with a French woman (although this was never confirmed for certain). If Grindelwald did father a child with someone in the Rosier family, this would be a pretty interesting parallel.

Spoilers for Crimes of Grindelwald ahead: 

In the cave, Dumbledore relives his worst memory. He pleads with Grindelwald to “stop hurting them, hurt me instead” which always seemed out of character for him. He is Albus Dumbledore. He could have fought Grindelwald to save his siblings. 

We know from King’s Cross that at the end of Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s summer together, Aberforth confronts Albus about his neglect of the family. Albus is defensive. Grindelwald and the Dumbledores start to argue, and a fight breaks out. Eventually, Ariana Dumbledore lies dead, and Dumbledore does not know if he or Grindelwald was the one to cast the spell that killed her. 

With the information from Crimes of Grindelwald, it all makes sense!!! 

Dumbledore and Grindelwald make a blood pact that prevents them from fighting each other. When the fight breaks out between them, they cannot harm each other, but Grindelwald can hurt Aberforth (and Ariana) all he wants, and BINGO! Dumbledore is helpless, and can only plead with Grindelwald to stop (hence, his worst memory). In despiration to stop his siblings’ torture, Dumbledore ignores the blood pact, and shoots a spell at Grindelwald, who coutners with one of his own. But neither can attack the other. The blood pact deflects the spells into poor Ariana, who is killed by one of the curses. Dumbledore does not know who fired the spell that killed his sister. 

Beyond that, here’s some speculation: Ariana was sweet and, I imagine, did not start conflict. So if Aberforth confronted Dumbledore, why was Grindelwald torturing both Aberforth AND Ariana (”don’t hurt *them*, hurt me instead”)?  I think Dumbledore confided in him that she was an obscurial. Grindelwald tortured her by calling out the obscurus, and possibly even trying to rip it from her. If he succeeded, he could have preserved it like Newt did with the one from the girl he met before the first movie. Grindelwald unleashes it in a second-salem orphanage in New York, hoping that it finds another host because “it’s useless without a host,” as Grindel-Graves tells Newt. He then manipulates the obscurial he created into believing they are a Dumbledore. The Dumbledore magic coursing through them and their own tortured soul calls a phoenix, convincing them of the ruse. He tells them they were abandoned by Albus, and he creates the perfect assassin who can kill the one person he cannot. ",FantasticBeasts,Credence/Ariana Theory that makes sense,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9zqlmm/credenceariana_theory_that_makes_sense/,1542968187.0

I don't mind having a lot of sub plots but if you have so many and only move forward a couple of steps for each of them I am sorry but that doesn't make for a good movie. I really don't think we needed that whole LesStrange backstory with the baby and stuff it just seemed like filler too me. Was I really supposed to care when she died? Newt's suddenly in love with Tina even-though he was very indifferent towards her in the first one. The film is called Crimes Of Grindelwald but I don't think he did anywhere near enough in the movie to warrant that title. I like Grindelwald as a villain but he didn't do enough. Also it happens in a lot of films where you like the villain and actually think they sort of have good reasons for their actions but then they kill a bunch of innocent people for no particular reason, well that happens here like when they kill that toddler for no real reason. Another thing I really hated was this stupid idea of having Voldemort's snake being a character now although I understand that that's just me and some people will like it. Most of the characters are so bland especially Newt and his brother. But my main complaint is that the story was just so slow and didn't move forward enough.

879,Majesticfacepalm,1542976558,"Hi Guys

So I wrote a comment on another movie thread recently which is below:

'It makes me think about when Dumbledore tells Harry love is the most powerful magic. Dumbledore knew how to destroy horcruxes (maybe learnt later in life) but doesn't seem sure he knows how to destroy the blood pact, which I'm guessing is made from a promise which stems from love and loyalty.'

This got me thinking back to the HP series. I was always a bit disappointed when Dumbledore said love is the most powerful magic and it's the power to bring down Voldemort. After CoG I think there's more to it than him just referring to the sacrifice Lily made. I think love was a big part of Dumbledores own struggles. The struggles with his family, Grindelwald and ultimately (if we are right that a curse rebounded onto his sister due to the blood pact) caused the death of his sister. I think love almost destroyed him in ways that other factors could not. 

Also I liked the movie, I felt it started slowly but at the end erupted into action. I think because we don't have books to go by this time the films need more build up and information so I was looking for the smallest detaills. There are some plot holes and question marks e.g. McGonnagal being at Hogwarts but this could easily be her mother or grandmother. I have enough faith in JK Rowling to cover all of these missing pieces by movie 5 like she did with almost everything in the books. I liked the fact that we saw alot of non verbal magic, as someone else mentioned we are seeing grown wizards at the height of their powers as opposed to children learning magic. Newt does some incredible things. All in all it's made me excited to follow a series again after HP finished.

What do you think?

883,flyer3522,1542956540,"Ok first off, sorry if you liked the movie, but I thought it was bad. Like, almost incomprehensible. The plot was a mess, the reveals were meaningless, and even when the movie started to actually have focus it had been so boring and contrived that the set-up for the next one was exhausting to get through. J.K. Rowling clearly writes books and not movies, and that was apparent as the lack of focus or coherence can only be explained by an author who wants to have a myriad of storylines without the appropriate amount of time to cover them all. So much goes nowhere, and I think that could be easily fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the opening is fine. Good action, engaging, and easy to follow, gets the plot moving. I'd be fine keeping that the way it is. After that, it makes sense to follow Newt, who should be THE definitive main character, like in the last one. Establish his home life, and have him meet his brother and establish his engagement to Leta at the ministry. Drop the stupid ""Tina thinks Newt is marrying Leta subplot""

&amp;#x200B;

The ministry scene can go down the way it did, only with way LESS exposition. Have Newt request to have his travel ban lifted, and establish that it's in order to go to New York to see Tina. That gives him and the audience clear set goals. Have the ministry offer Newt a job as a auror, the catch being that he needs to find and kill Creedence, as Newt is an expert on Obscurials. Instead of having Newt turn this down because of ""not wanting to pick sides"" have him turn it down because he's not a killer. And, instead of having the ministry hire some nameless goon to track him down, have it be Leta herself. This offers some major conflict for later on.

&amp;#x200B;

Have Newt being tracked or whatever, and Dumbledore manages to get in contact with him anyway, and the scene with Newt and Albus should go similarly to the movie, except it should be Dumbledore, not the ministry, who tips off Newt that Credence is in Paris. This establishes that Dumbledore is one step ahead of them. Also, have Newt's change of heart come from the fact that Dumbledore wants Newt to rehabilitate Credence rather than killing him.

&amp;#x200B;

When Queen and Jacob arrive at Newt's place, have it be for an actual reason, instead of having it be seemingly inconsequential. Drop the meaningless subplot with the love spell and instead have Queenie say that her and Jacob are getting married secretly in England. And then drop the bombshell: that Tina was tasked with tracking Grindelwald by the American ministry and is now missing. This further incentivizes Newt to engage in this mission, and he reveals to them that he has a lead as to where Grindelwald might be. Instead of it just being Jacob and Newt, Queenie should also be joining them in illegally traveling to Paris.

Meanwhile, in Paris, establish that Credence is looking for clues of his heritage, where he comes across the circus and sees Nagini, having him empathize with her. Have him meet with her after the show and have them establish a relationship, rather than having a relationship that the audience didn't see. Later you can have Creedence watching another performance, only when things do go wrong, have it be because Credence saw Nagini being abused and his obscurial came out, thus making his presence in Paris publicly known. When the French ministry does show up to investigate, have Tina be one of the aurors, working undercover for the American ministry.  Yusuf Kama, whose presence felt entirely forced in the movie, can be Tina's superior, and, due to Tina's knowledge of the obscurial, is visibly suspicious of her.

&amp;#x200B;

Have Newt and co. arrive at Paris shortly after this happened, and have Newt do some magical creature nonsense to find out that Tina had been in Paris, and have them be able to track down the circus that Credence was at.

&amp;#x200B;

The scene where the ministry arrives at Hogwarts and questions Dumbledore, as well as Leta's flashback was essential to establishing the plot point of the blood oath for the audience as well as giving Leta a bit more backstory, and should probably be kept, minus the nonsensical McGonagall cameo. The main change I would've made is to have Dumbledore intentionally reveal Newt's location to the ministry, and therefore have him set up the later events, as he has a habit for manipulating actions in order to reach an end goal.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, Grindelwald would've heard about the attack at the circus, and sends his followers to search for Credence there. Have them searching the circus at the same time as Newt and co., and have Queenie be able to read their minds and tell that they're working for Grindelwald. Using the magical beasts they subdue them and, with Queenie's legilimacy, are able to derive Grindelwald's location before aurors come to arrest the followers.

Tina is involved in arresting the followers and notices that the swooping evil was what had restrained them, and puts together that Newt is in Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

Credence and Nagini still go to the orphanage where Credence grew up, and again they're left with more questions than answers. The only difference being that instead of Grindelwald's followers attacking, Credence is instead told that as a baby, he was transported by a young girl, rather than an adult. This ties into the mystery element that wasn't properly expunged upon in the movie. Also, if a scene needs to establish Grindelwald as a proper villain, have him learn about Credence searching for answers and order the murder of this woman/house elf hybrid later.

&amp;#x200B;

Newt and co. are revealed to have stolen hairs off of the followers of Grindelwald, and, on Dumbledore's advice, head to the Paris safe house, which is the home of Nicolas Flamel. There, Flamel can have a similar scene as in the film, except this time he serves a purpose, which is to provide the trio with poly juice potion. Queenie and Newt drink the potion and disguise themselves as Grindelwald's followers to gain access to Grindelwald's hideout and hopefully learn of Credence's location, while Jacob stays with Flamel.

&amp;#x200B;

Tina is working at the ministry of France, looking through Newt's records from the English ministry when she stumbles across Leta's file. She's about to read it when Yusuf calls her into his office and locks the door. Tina notices a strange mark on his arm when Yusuf asks her how long she had been working for Grindelwald. Tina denies this under the threat of death, before finally admitting to being an American spy on the case to find Credence Barebone. Yusuf smiles, telling her he gave her veretiserum earlier, and says that he trusts her and wants her to help him track him down before Grindelwald. Tina says she knows someone who might help.

&amp;#x200B;

Newt and Queenie make it into Grindelwald's safe house, where they try to act inconspicuous despite Newt's social inadequacy. Grindelwald shows up, and Queenie whispers t Newt that she can't read his thoughts. Newt notices a small metal vial on Grindelwald's waist. Grindelwald speaks with them casually about his cause, before asking his other followers to leave. He then addresses Newt by name, and asks him about New York. Newt instinctively pulls out his wand but Grindelwald casually disarms him, saying they are fighting for the same thing, and, addressing Queenie directly, says that he wants harmony between the muggles and the wizards, and freedom for them to marry who they like. This gives Queenie a more direct line of reasoning for her to change sides at the end. Queenie asks if they are free to leave, to which Grindelwald allows Queenie to do so, but asks Newt to stay behind. Newt says he'll meet her at the safe house with Jacob. Grindelwald asks Newt what Albus has been telling him, with Newt responding that he hasn't talked to Dumbledore since Hogwarts. Grindelwald chastises him for lying, and asks him if he's comfortable being a puppet. Grindelwald's followers start to re-enter the room, when Newt pulls out from his pocket the size changing dragon from the first film and manages to escape with help from his beasts.

&amp;#x200B;

Credence and Nagini are walking down the street when they are stopped by a wizard handing out cards. Credence flips the card over and the lettering transforms into an image of Gellert Grindelwald.

&amp;#x200B;

Tina and Yusuf investigate the orphanage where they find the dead woman with no marks on her. Searching through the orphanages registration records, they find that Credence was originally transferred over 20 years ago under an unknown name, and taken abroad to New York.

&amp;#x200B;

The ministry, including Leta and Newts brother, arrive at the safe house on Dumbledore's tip and arrest Jacob and Queenie for traveling across borders illegally, before Newt arrived back at the house after the incident with Grindelwald. Leta demands to know where Newt is, to which Queenie responds that he was last at Grindelwald's hideout. They demand they tell them the location, after which they'll obliviate Jacob, which Queenie begs them not to do. They take them down to the French ministry for questioning, where at the same time Tina/Yusuf arrive to review the records on Credence.

&amp;#x200B;

Credence and Nagini travel to the location on Grindelwald's card, where he is greeted by none other than Grindelwald, who is threatened by Credence for abandoning him in New York. Grindelwald apologizes, saying that his lineage was destined for greatness. Credence demands to know where he came from, which Grindelwald said will be answered in due time, if he listens to what he has to say. Grindelwald asks him to come to his rally later, and his heart will tell him what's right. He tells Credence to wait for his sign, then apparatus away.

&amp;#x200B;

Newt is hiding from Grindelwald's followers when he receives a letter from a mysterious owl saying that's he's needed in the ministry in Paris and to bring help. Newt heads to the ministry, pretending to be his brother Theseus, and manages to get in to the lower levels when he sees that Queenie and Jacob are being held for questioning. His nifflers create a distraction while he manages to get them out, when he runs into Theseus. The two duel, and Newt starts losing when Leta arrives, and surprisingly disarms Theseus. She tells Newt they need to get out now. Tina is examining Credence's records when she realizes that the date of Credences adoption lines up with the disappearance of a pure blood wizard baby by the name of Corvus Lestrange. Just then she hears a commotion, as Newt has kept his case on him and used a shrinking charm to conceal it, allowing him to use a thunderbird in order to fight off ministry officials. Tina grabs her wand and hurries downstairs to where Newt is. Tina runs into Newt as he's running with Jacob and Queenie toward the exit, and she begrudgingly helps him by using her password to get to the ground level. As they're all about to reach the exit, however, Yusuf and the ministry guards cut them off and order their arrest on site. The reunited group are all jailed in the dungeon below, similar to the first one, where Tina and Newt, as well as Jacob and Queenie, share emotional scenes. Yusuf comes down and demands to know where Credence is from Newt, threatening to torture his friends, which newt responds that he doesn't know. Tina tells him he knows Credences real name is Corvus Lestrange. Queenie reads his mind and realizes he's working for Grindelwald. Confronted by this, Yusuf orders their execution then leaves. Newt's bow truckle picks the lock and the gang manage to escape as Leta overrides security and returns all their wands. Newt asks her if she ever had a brother, which she responds she didn't want him to hate her for what she did. Queenie seems. unable to read her mind either. Theseus joins them, despite Newt's protests, saying that stopping Grindelwald and finding Credence is more important than keeping his job at the ministry. Leta says that she thinks she knows where Credence is, but they need to hurry.

&amp;#x200B;

In Paris, black ribbons cascade over the city only seen by wizards in the film to call Grindelwald's followers to an undisclosed location.

&amp;#x200B;

Newt, with Tina, Jacob, Leta, Queenie, and Theseus, apparate in a graveyard. Leta explains that this is her family's tomb, and that, the Lestrange name died with Corvus. We see another figure apparate into view, Credence, accompanied by Nagini. They pull their wands out at him except Newt, who tries to explain to Credence that they don't want to hurt him. Credence asks if any of them have the answers, and if he's actually Leta's long lost brother. Leta gives the same exposition about the switched babies as in the movie, and tells Credence she wished she knew more. Credence is hurt by this, when suddenly a blue ring of fire appears, as Grindelwald is starting his speech to his followers. Tina realizes this was a set up to get them here, and there is an apparition lock, meaning they can't escape. She puts together that Leta had set them up, and to the heartbreak of Theseus, Leta was working for Grindelwald, which she also confesses to, imploring the rest to just hear him out.

&amp;#x200B;

The begrudgingly start to listen to Grindelwald as the ministry shows up to break up the rally, with Theseus joining them. Newt notices that vial and releases a niffler into the crowd. The speech scene was done really well in the film, the only thing I would change is the aftermath.

&amp;#x200B;

When Grindelwald draws his flaming circle that kills people unloyal to him, Queenie and other would be enticed to join his side while Tina, Thesues etc. attempt to fight him off. When Grindelwald is winning, and close to killing Newt, that should be when Leta distracts him by offering to join him, however she intentionally avoids the fire  and duels Grindelwald, betraying him for her love for Newt, holding him off just long enough for Newt and Theseus to escape. Also, instead of Credence reluctantly joining Grindelwald, the fighting should cause his Obscurus to come out, resulting in the ministry fighting him. Then, to hint at the twist, a phoenix should come and help fight off the attackers. Grindelwald tells Credence, in his Obscurus form, to join him, which Credence does, resulting in Grindelwald leaving and our heroes, except for Queenie who joined Grindelwald, left alone and saddened after losing Leta. The niffler still gets the vial, and we're still left on the same cliffhanger reveal of Aurelius Dumbledore, only the movie behind it is much more focused.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall the changes where mostly to the second act which relied on an onfocused low stakes plot with an often times non-linear or unconnected narrative that only came together through coincidence as opposed to common themes or a better plot. I tried to keep the main revelations the same while altering character motivations to be more believable/in character.

The critics call this movie ""a franchise killing disaster"", I'm like, overexaggerating much?!

Leta did not see the baby Corvus actually drown, she saw the bundle of blankets sinking in the water as she and the swapped baby who grew up to be Credence were taken away in another life boat.

 But since the baby who grew up to be Credence was magical, he likely came from a magical family and was not a Muggle Born.  Thus, the mother of the baby who grew up to be Credence, while watching the baby Corvus sink (who she did not know had been swapped) could have said ""Accio Baby Blankets"" to retrieve the sinking baby, just after Leta stopped looking in that direction so that Leta did not know it had happened.

Or else J.K. Rowling could write anything she wanted into the story that happened after Leta stopped looking.  A MerPerson saved the baby.  Or a Kelpie saved the baby.

I thought about Grindelwalds plan to use Credence to kill Dumbledore. Why doesn't Grindelwald go after Albus himself? Is he afraid of him? Hell no. Grindelwald is confident about his chances against Albus. The is a single reason why he doesn't do it - His ""blood oath"". Maybe he does not know how to destroy it. So that's why he need a strong individual who could take on Albus. In this case Credence ... or his Obscurus to be specific. The whole ""you are a Dumbledore"" - crap serves only the purpose to focus Credence's hate on Albus.

But what about his backstory? I really believe that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was swaped with Corvus and survived. After he was adopted he had a pretty terrible life.

His abusive childhood led him into suppressing his powers which turned him into an Obscurial. It is interesting that his Obscurus survived that long. Newt mentioned that an Obscurial does not live that long because they lack love and affection. (A very brutal study from the 40s showed that human infants die if they don't get any human affection or love)

This doesnt have to mean anything tho because Obscuri are very rare during the time of ""CoG"". It is stated that there weren't any Obscuri on U.S soil for over 200 years. So I assume that there isn't much known about these ""things"".

In conclusion, I think Credence is a random half-blood or pure blood who had the misfortune of surviving that sinking ship and being adopted by a crazy anti-witchcraft hag who led him into suppressing his powers thus making him an Obscurus and a perfect tool for Grindelwald.

So, for those confused about the McGonagall cameo in the new Fantastic Beasts, I theorize that it is no one other Minerva McGonagall herself utilizing a time turner. 

For clarification, yes Pottermore states that the use of a time-turner should be limited to 5 hours or less, however it is indisputable that Professor McGonagall is a master of her craft. She is arguably one of the best witches in the magical world at transfiguration. So it goes without saying that she would be more adept at time-travel, and such the usage of a time-turner, than the average witch or wizard.

First, the mushroom cloud synonymous with an atomic bomb was first seen in Halifax in 1917 but the word “nuclear” wasn’t common prior to 1944. 

Second, prior to 1944, the use of nuclear fission was termed the Atomic Age or Atomic Era. The bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were called atomic bombs. This wouldn’t occur until 1945. 

Third, nuclear fission was known prior to 1944 but the application of nuclear fission to the development of an atomic bomb wasn’t until 1930 when the work of Albert Einstein was applied and even then it wasn’t until 1938 that an atom was split by German scientists. It took seven years and loads of resources to develop the first atomic bomb in 1945. 

This bothers me because Jacob shouldn’t have known what the mushroom cloud signified or even had words to explain what the bomb was. 

I can brush past the numerous other plot holes but this was poor history. Oddly I find that more of an affront than the identity of Credence or Queenie’s decision. 

Had they showed the mushroom cloud and the resulting devastation for emotional impact that would’ve been appropriate. They were devastating and ended WWII for that very reason. But to apply the wrong term and make it seem like it was common knowledge was poor story telling.

So, everyone is giving backlash against J.K. Rowling because Professor McGonagall was featured in Fantastic Beasts before she was supposedly born, as inferences show. The evidence pointing to when she was born was linked together between her character profile on Pottermore, which never lists a date, and an argument between herself and Dolores Umbridge in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she reveals that she has been teaching for 39 years. On her character profile, there is a birthday listed, but no year.

McGonagall’s Life in a heartbeat: Minerva was born to Isobel Ross (A Witch) and Robert McGonagall (A Muggle). She received her letter to Hogwarts and studied there for the full 7 years. When 18, she worked at the Ministry for 2 years and despised it. She wrote a letter to Hogwarts enquiring for posts.

Now, here’s where it gets interesting. The headmaster of the school, Armando Dippet, wrote back as quickly as he could to tell her she can work under the Transfiguration Department along with Albus Dumbledore as the Head of the Department. As readers, we know that there is only one person teaching each subject at Hogwarts, as there is never a need for other teachers to split up schedules. Dumbledore, who is teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts at this time, could easily have a Transfiguration job as well. So, naturally, employing another person to help with teaching the students would be the practical decision to do. He employs McGonagall to help teach some classes while he teaches DADA to other students. Though Minerva is teaching Transfiguration, it’s more like an internship to her than an actual job position. This also fits into the fact that McGonagall can be at Hogwarts and Dumbledore can still teach Tom Riddle Transfiguration. In this time period, Dumbledore is Deputy Headmaster. In 1945, Tom Riddle graduates Hogwarts and, at age 19, seeks out to plant one of his horcruxes at Hogwarts. The easiest way to do this is to fill the gap of DADA. Let’s suppose Headmaster Dippet is out for the rest of the year or something like that. Instantly, Dumbledore will presume the office of Headmaster and will decline Tom Riddle’s offer. Out of anger, Riddle places a curse on the DADA position that nobody can last more than 3 terms in office as a DADA professor.

Now, the year is 1955/1956. Headmaster Dippet steps down from office whether he’s dead or not. As Dumbledore is Deputy, he takes the office and leaves the Deputy Headmistress position to Minerva. And McGonagall can finally call her job a full time one and starts to count this year as a full year. This is why Minerva says she’s been teaching for 39 years. She’s been teaching full time for 39 years and been at Hogwarts for God knows how long.

But hey, that’s just a theory! A Film Theory!! And...

After one year or two of low profile and undercover trips he finds Albus only to know that Ariana is dead and it can be Albus or Aberforth's fault. He is so angry and he leaves his sons never wanting to see them again. He tries to form a family again with some female witch and they have a child( Creedence ).

Percival realises that his child and wife are not safe anymore, so he send both to america in a muggle boat to not rise up attention and then the Leta exchange happen.

The timeline will be:

1899 : Ariana dies

1900 : Percival find out that Ariana is dead by Albus and Aberforth and then he leave they angry

After they find out that Ariana was hit by one of the spells and was killed, Albus might have thought that it was a good chance that, because he was using a shield charm, that one of the spells might have bounced away towards Arianna and killed her. 

This particularly made me believe is true when Albus said that he didn't love Arianna  enough. Because he only defended Grindelwald and didn't fight him when he knew that he was wrong.

At the end of Crimes of Grindelwald, Gellert tells Credence two things,

1. His real name is Aurelius Dumbledore 
2. His brother is moving against him

There are many theories around this. A couple of them are, 

1. Gellert is telling the truth and Credence is really Aurelis Dumbledore.

2. Gellert is lying to try and manipulate Credence/Aurelis #Credelius into going after Albus because Gellert can't due to the bloodpact.

The 2nd is very possible but what about the first?

Percival Dumbledore (Albus's father) was sent to Azkaban for life before Albus started at Hogwarts and supposedly died shortly after.

His mother, Kendra, died shortly after Albus graduated from Hogwarts.

So unless Percival somehow escaped from Azkaban after Ariana died then and started another family and had a son then there is no way Credelius is Albus's brother let alone a Dumbledore...

Which brings me to my theory.

I believe Gellert was only half lying to Credence, telling him that he is Arelius Dumbledore is a lie to get him to specifically target Dumbledore, but the part about his ""Brother moving against him"" is true and he planted the Phoenix chick for Credence to find to back up his lie.

In Crimes of Grindelwald we know that Albus and Gellert can't attack one another due to the bloodpact they made between them so Gellert needs to find another powerful wizard he can use to defeat Dumbledore.

We know that Credence is very powerful and is even more so thanks to being a Obscurus.

We also see at the end of CoG that Gellert gives Credence a wand, and what are the chances of him just having a wand that will work for Credence?

I theorize that Credence Barebone is actually Credence Grindelwald and the reason why the wand works so well for Credence is because, much like how Ron Weasley was using his older brothers wand in the first two Harry Potter books, Credence is using the wand of his elder brother, Gellert Grindelwald.",FantasticBeasts,SPOILERS.

937,theladyunderground,1542842291,"CREDENCE’S BIRTH

I’m guessing that Credence was born around 1904-1906. Although there are some timeline contradictions concerning this, this period of 3 years would make the most sense, and most of them can be explained away.


concerning kendra dumbledore

We know that Kendra Dumbledore dies in 1899 at the hands of Arianna Dumbledore. But just because Credence is a Dumbledore doesn’t mean that she’s Credence’s mother. In fact, for Leta and Corvus we see this, two sibling born of different mothers, but with the same father so they both carry the surname. So we could reasonably argue that Percival Dumbledore, simply just married another woman, or had an illegitimate child with another woman. Most likely he had an illegitimate child with another woman because we do see him sending the child off, and it makes little sense that a Dumbledore would be moved to America instead of given to Aberforth or Albus to take care of him, if he was illegitimate it would be easier to hide him. Aberforth or Albus, while not having a large reason to hide another Dumbledore sibling could also have been simply hiding him from the general public which maybe didn’t look so well on their father.

Furthermore, this allows for Albus and Credence to be over 2 decades apart in age without the issues of Kendra not being able to have children anymore.


concerning percival dumbledore

So the issue with Percival is that he was convicted of attacking three young muggles, most likely those who had caused Ariana to become a obscurial. He was sentenced to die in Azkaban after that starting 1891, meaning that he couldn’t give birth to a kid in 1906 if he was in Azkaban, but I have a solution for that as well.

We know that Percival probably wasn’t a blood-purist. Ariana was either a squib or an obscurial, and it’s noted he + Kendra didn’t want anyone finding out, not because they were ashamed, but because they didn’t want her kept in St. Mungo’s for the rest of her life. Furthermore, Kendra herself was a muggleborn, suggesting he didn’t think them any lower. A final example of this is that neither Albus, nor Aberforth support blood purity, and both of them actively fight against it, and those who do support it. While you could argue that both of them are good people, the only other occurrence of both siblings fighting against the dark lord, not with (even when it would benefit them) are Regulus and Sirius Black. Even then Regulus originally fought with Voldemort. So it’s unlikely that he attacked those three muggles because he hated him, but more likely that he attacked them because they were the ones who attacked Ariana, something he probably never revealed.

We know his dad was sentenced to death in the part where Doge writes:
Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well publicized attack upon three young Muggles. Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. 

There are two ways that his Percival Dumbledore could’ve gotten out of Azkaban that I can think of. 

The first one includes Percival paying them off. But something we don’t know is the wealth of the Dumbledore’s. We can guess that they were most likely somewhat comfortable. But most likely not rich enough to pay the way out of Azkaban. 
So the next idea is that he somehow ended up acquitted. It’s said that he did a terrible and savage thing, but we’re never told he killed the muggles, in fact, the three times Dumbledore’s mentioned we never hear it said as that, or suggested. We just know he attacked them. In the movies Aunt Muriel says that he killed them, but that’s also Aunt Muriel, and she also says quite a few other nonfactual things in that same span of 15 minutes, so I’m not relying on her for our information right now. We know he’s sentenced to death, but we don’t know if he dies in Azkaban. The phrasing “who was to die in Azkaban,” is easily read as Percival Dumbledore was given a life sentence in Azkaban and was to die there. But after that we hear nothing else about his possible death in Azkaban. This provides room for us to think that he might’ve been acquitted, or perhaps he eventually told them about Ariana’s attack, and his actual motivations for attacking the three boys. It’s suggested that the muggles were the ones who attacked Ariana, and that he refused to talk on it because he didn’t want her sent to St. Mungo’s once more. Ariana’s death in 1899 would’ve meant that he didn’t have to worry about that anymore. So it stands to reason that perhaps he had his sentence shortened by revealing this, getting his sentence limited, and then leaving Azkaban anytime from about 1901 to 1905. He would’ve then had time to meet someone and have a kid from 1904 - 1906.


why i choose these years over 1901

I realise that it’s said that Credence was born in 1901, but I choose to disregard that for one main reason. Leta Lestrange.

We know that Leta switches her half-brother on a ship to New York with another baby, and that baby she ends up with is Credence. We’re then told that this baby that Leta ends up with is then given to Mary Lou Barebone and raised by her, aka Credence. While yes, Leta is alive in 1901, she would’ve been four at the eldest. I don’t think, watching that clip, that she’s four years old, a four year old wouldn’t remember that so clearly, be clever enough to do it, or have the swimming skills that we see Leta exhibit. I place her at around 8 to 10. Not quite at Hogwarts yet, but still old enough to be making those sort of decisions. Or maybe even the year that she turned 11, but wasn’t at Hogwarts yet.

I understand some people might not think that an 10/11 year old can be that contentious, or swim that well, but as the older sister of an 11 year old I can assure you, she can swim very well, and having an older sibling tends to make you more mature.

Just doing some simple math, we can then put 1904 - 1906 as the years that Leta would’ve been 8 - 10. Subtracting that from 1927 we end up with 21 - 23 years old, while this younger than what I would expect for Credence, it’s not insane. Ezra Miller said his character was 18, and while other news has told us otherwise, this is a good intermediate, and in the middle of these two years, enough so that I believe it to be in the range of reasonable ages for Credence.

So that’s how I think the timeline could've played out! The deaths and births of everyone except for Credence staying the same, Percival receiving a shorter sentence after revealing the truth after Ariana’s death, getting out of Azkaban, having Credence with another person, then sending him off to America in the hopes of giving him a better life.

939,theladyunderground,1542840767,"Okay. I know that prophecy number 20 could be about the LeStranges still, but I do believe it’s about the Dumbledore’s. 

""Son Cruelly Banished
Despair of the Daughter
Return, Great Avenger
With Wings from the Water""

“Son Cruelly Banished” could very easily be referring to Credence since he wasn’t raised by Aberforth or Albus, both of whom probably would’ve wanted to raise him as best as they could. Especially since they lowkey failed with Ariana.

“Despair of the Daughter” probably means Ariana because of her grief, we know her magic was wack because of what happened to her after all.

“Return, Great Avenger” I think this refers to Percival Dumbledore, the father of Ariana, Aberforth, Albus, and Aurelius(for now). He was put in Azkaban for attacking 3 muggles, rumoured to be the muggles who attacked Ariana, causing her to loose control. Kendra died in 1899, but it’s likely that Credence was born in 1904-1906(I have an entire timeline for this), and so Percival either was released, or escaped from Azkaban, making him the ‘Avenger’ of his daughters condition, and his ‘return’ is simply a return to society.

“With Wings from the Water” okay, this is the part I have no answers for. Perhaps its alluding to how Percival escaped, or left Azkaban, or how Credence might try to avenge himself being left behind, or how he was rescued from dying on that shop. I don’t really know.

If you watch The Magicians tv show, you know that there is one character who can re-set time and you find out that the characters in the show aren't on their first rodeo trying to defeat the bad guy. They are on something like the 40th try! Every time that they attempt to kill him, they change something to see if it will work out differently. 

This got me thinking...

What if this isn't the first time Dumbledore tried to defeat Grindelwald? What if he failed the first time, but was still alive due to the blood pact?

What if he needed more help to get the job done and is sending powerful witches and wizards back in time to help him?

Things that support this idea- 

1. There is no way that Minerva McGonagall can be a mistake...there just isn't. JK, published McGonagall's backstory in just the past few years after I believe she already knew how FB was going to play out in movie form. I think she intentionally put it there to rile up fans at this very moment. 

2. Flamel's book, with a Phoenix on the cover, looks to contain pictures of witches and wizards in the Order, but several pages are blank. What if not all of the key players have arrived from the future yet? We still have many years to go before the defeat of Grindelwald. You wouldn't want them all to arrive en masse, because someone would notice. You'd want to send them back slowly and hide them in plain site...like as a teacher at Hogwarts.   

3. Dumbledore has always hinted that he knows things before they happen. I was always kind of frustrated by this in HP. Even in this last movie, he seems to know that Grindelwald will have a rally and that Theseus shouldn't go. 

The most frustrating thing about this theory is that Dumbledore could send back just about anyone! I would hate it if all kinds of fan favorites from HP are able to just show up and report to Dumbledore for duty. Seems a little cheesy.

This post isn't to rehash those points, but to point out something which I found interesting but hasn't been discussed yet.

In Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, we see during Grindelwald speech that he shows a future prediction of the world in 15 years, mechanized infantry, the nuclear bombing of Japan etc. The Wizard reaction is a mix of awe, surprise, and I might even say, fear. Their view of Muggle capacity is being used as a major point in Grindelwald ideology that Muggles need to be controlled to prevent this destruction.

Is the Wizards reaction to the capacity of Muggles one of fear, or just surprise. If not, why is it being used as such a central point? Is Grindewlads point that Muggles may surpass Wizards and therefore be viewed as a threat? If we look at the technological curve of progression in the 20th century and the state if theoretical physics (graviton, string theory), we may not fight Wizard now, but in 2150, 2200, we will almost have the capacity.

But what if there are more Dumbledores other than just Albus and Aberforth? 

It is totally possible that their father Percival had siblings. If Percival for example had another brother that also inherited the name and this brother had children of his own - in my theory this would be Credence/Aurelius and at least one brother that assumingly hated Credence/Aurelius.

 That would opening up a lot of story possibilities with Credence truly beeing a Dumbledore (Cousin to Albus and Aberforth) so the Phoenix would make sense without beeing a trick by Grindelwald, it would fit in the timeline and would not be contrary to the lore so far and it would still give Grindelwald a lever on Credence to act against Albus Dumbledore as a part of the family that abandoned him and seemingly didn't care for him.

As seen in FB2 the mayor conflict between Grindelwald's followers and the muggles will be the upcoming WWII.
In his speach he shows the destruction of this war which will definitely also affect the wizardly world.

As we know by history he will be defeatet by Dumbledore in 1945. The next movies will be covering that time span.

Now the question: does Grindelwald oppose or favor the rising Nazi regime in Germany?

Both him and the Nazis favor ""pure blood"" and see some humans as ""Untermenschen"". His ideology is quiet similar to Hitler and it's also easy comparing the results of the holocaust and the murder of Sinti and Roma and Euthanasia programs with his plans of an a rising of the wizards. The Nazi leaders were very fond especially of the occult. According to Rowling the head of government in a country mostly know about the secret wizard government too. All that and his defeat at the end of WWII seem to indicate a collaboration with the Nazis. Also his fortress being in Austria and the German name bonds him with the presumingly German wizard society. 

On the other hand he warns exactly that the muggles will hunt witches and wizards as another race, which could mean the Nazis could the the main muggle enemy. It is an interesting thought that the Nazis were fond of the occult because they want to exterminate witches and wizards.

The real problem is that this film had the potential that was exploited badly or simply exploited to cash out millions of dollars. So we ask Warner Bros., who funded the production, to David Yates, who is the director, J. K. Rowling, who participated in the drafting of the screenplay and is the creator of the whole magical world of which we are fans, to put a hand on the conscience and think of the many fans of this fantastic world who found themselves baffled, to say little, after watching the movie. Since it would be impossible to remedy the holes of the script and the errors mentioned before with the next film of the saga, the only solution seems to erase everything and rewrite from the basics all the film, because it is often better to amputate the limb to Avoid getting infected all the body.

Redmayne, Law and Depp were perfect performers!
There were funny moments, intense and emotional moment and a lot of flashbacks.
Ok, there were plot holes, but instead of shrieking all around that the film was shitty, Rowling sucks and the franchise is dead, maybe we should just wait? There are three more films coming and I believe many holes will be filled then.
Also, I think many fans had become toxic because they simply grew up. I mean, as children we didn't care about detailed explanation about why some things worked the way they did. Like in HP book 1 - one of the most magical items was hidden behind some queer tasks one yeat students managed to get through... We just took it the way it is, cause it's magic and fantasy. I'm sure many things we could figure out ourselves if we were children. We didn't need someone to tell us reasons why. We had rich imagination within us. Growing up some people loose it, and here is where I see many potterfans becoming toxic.
Also, unpopular opinion - I loved the Cursed Child with the plot holes I could fill in by my own imagination.

You've been warned.

Hey  guys, I've been thinking about the end of the movie, where it is said  that Credence is Albus brother, but for me it makes no sense.  So I  tought, is it possible that Credence is actualy Albus nephew? I mean, I  know Ariana was only 14 at the time of her death, but we see plenty of  girls getting pregnant at this age so it is possible, and there is the 3  muggles that beat her up (that's why albus father was sent to Azkaban).  So maybe Creedence, or Aurelius, is the product of a rape and that is  why he was given away.

A baby conceived  of rape was concidered a shameful thing to a family and we know that  wizards are very conservative in the 1980's, so imagine it in the 19th  century.

972,Allons-y2121,1542791997,"First of all i love the movie, even if i already know what's gonna happend (yes i spoil myself for accident but i want to see it to see what i think of it after all the mixed critics).

The movie in my opinion is not hard to follow, yes it has multiple characters in different locations and can be kinda overwhelming but it wasn't the case for me. Maybe because i find it similar to Infinity War with all the plots and characters and that movie doesn't seem to me complicated to follow, and either this one. The only moment that i kinda lose the plot was in the cemetery but Yusuf and Leta explained well enough. Yes, several questions arise like who was the mother of Creedence in the boat ( i don't buy for a second that he is a Dumbledore. After all Queenie told Grindelwald how approach to Creedence so he can trust him. And the phoenix can be a trap like all the Lestrange thing was to get everyone to the cemetery, even Creedence. So if Grindelwald lies to him, he gains his trust by giving him a family and a weapon against Dumbledore, by saying that his brother want to kill him ). But they will not reveal everything at the end of the second movie, when they have 3 more to come and Creedence seems to have an important role in the future of the saga. The only thing that can be done is to speculate until the next chapter of the saga.

I also read the Mcgonagall and Dumbledore teaching controversy and i want you to see this theory that makes fit both characters in their respective roles

Now for the beast, they were incredible. I'm in love with the Zouwu and some important things happen thanks to the beast like the break in the circus, Newt Tina and Leta arriving on time to the meeting, the amazing Niffler stealing the blood pact of Grindelwald. The scenes with the beast were visually beautiful and i expect to get more in the future movies, i'm sure they will be important to debunk Grindelwald's plans.

The interactions between characters could be better, i like the way they represent the Newt-Leta-Theseus triangle relationship but yes i would have liked to see more of Tina as a character or more interaction with Newt ( i really love the Tina character ). I also like one scene with Queenie and Jacob when she call him coward and Jacob get angry, like he was a war hero and yes he loves Queenie and for that reason that statement hurts him more and in the heat of the moment he call her crazy. It's a subtle scene but i really like it. And speaking of Queenie yes she seem completely out of his character but i think it is because the fear of losing the only person that loves her just like she is and is not scared or uncomfortable by his powers so she has to take drastic methods to make sure he doesn't gonna leave her. It's kinda stupid for her part but love and fear mixed is not a good combination. And for the last Creedence was a good character, very powerful but not well developed. He was in the movie and knowing nothing of what's happening around him except for Grindelwald and i think that is what make it feel the character more distant and not very compacible. Nagini was a good easter egg that it work but it was pointless to be in this movie except for the simple reason of presenting the character.

Dumbledore and Grindelwald were the best of the movie and i think that with they the movie go foward more faster and keep the audience wanting to know what's gonna happend next. Jude Law give us a very good Dumbledore with more vitality that in the Harry Potter movies( is young so it's logical, one with the age becomes more slow and quiet ) and it has some moments that reminds me of the ramblings that the old Dumbledore has. Depp was amazing, very charismatic and convincing and i want to see more of him for sure. The way that the movie presents him like a compassionate guy in the eyes of most of his followers but then they show us scenes when he is ruthless and extremist deep inside are amazing. And for the way they represent the Dumbledore-Grindelwald romance is good for me, they show some but not too much and there are hints but like i said they not gonna reveal everyrthing in the second movie. After all not everyone knows that they have a relationship in the past. I want to see what's gonna happend when they meet face to face.

Flamel was badass in the end of the movie so that's pretty much what i have to say of he.

To end this post i will repeat i really like this movie and the flaws that it could have aren't that bad and yes it feels like is a advance for the next movie but to be honest The Prisioner of Azkaban feels like that to me and yet i love both the movie and the book. I really want to see the future of this movies and i hope that 2020 come fast.

Please forgive the obviousness of this, but so far I haven't seen it written down anywhere else, and I wanted to discuss.

* Grindelwald isn't lying: Credence has got to really be Albus's brother, named Aurelius Dumbledore. Sure Grindelwald is a liar, and sometimes he even gets stuff wrong, but ending a whole movie with a random lie would just be illogical.
* So Percival Dumbledore has to be Credence's father. Based on Credence's age and the established timeline, Credence would have to have been conceived after Percival was sent to Azkaban.
* So logically, Percival fathered Credence/Aurelius while at Azkaban.

Not sure how this is possible, but the circumstances of it must have been strange enough that a decision was taken to send the baby by boat to America. And in a way it would sort of make sense for Grindelwald to know about this wayward Dumbledore child even though most other people don't: Grindelwald is kind of a dark guy who probably knows various other evil characters who could probably find out about it if a child were somehow conceived at Azkaban.

Beyond that, I don't know what to say. Hard to imagine exactly \*how\* or \*why\* old Percival would be fathering children in a wizard prison.

What if Abernathy was posing as Grindelwald who was posing as Graves during the whole first Fantastic Beasts movie? And Grindelwald was posing as Abernathy during that whole movie as well. This could be why Newt doesn't become the master of the Elder Wand after the end of the first movie since it was actually Abernathy the whole time! He turns into Grindelwald at the end when he is captured. There is never a switch because Grindelwald was never captured at all in the first place, a switch would be next to impossible under MACUSA's watch. Abernathy was very interested in Queenie in the first movie as well (which is really Grindelwald), probably because he knew of her abilities, and that explains why he knows Queenie so will in the second movie. This could also explain why Graves did not know of Creedence's origins since it was actually Abernathy posing as Graves and not Grindelwald. Abernathy is also hesitant about handing over the Blood Pact Peg, and only does so when the president requests him to. Grindelwald needs the peg which is why he goes after the carriage in the first place. I also believe that Abernathy is a metamorphageous which is why he can change his appearance at will. In the second movie Abernathy poses as an old woman and then transforms back as soon as he is safely in the elevator.

Alright, so I'm not sure if this is me missing something or the movie however I've just saw *Fantastic Beast and The Crimes of Grindlewald* a few days ago (amazing!) however, I'm a bit lost on how Jacob the No-maj regain his memory. I know he explained that happy memories were not erased however that made me remember all those times in Harry Potter the spell Obliviate was used. At first I thought of Ron Weasley using Obliviate on Gilderoy Lockhart and it completely wiped his memory. Was it because Ron's wand was broken and that was why Lockhart's memories were completely wiped?

But what about the time Hermione used Obliviate on her parents? That completely wiped their memories of her! And that includes happy memories!

983,apsmolders,1542763490," Dear Reddit, here's my first post in the FantasticBeasts thread :)

It's about Mcgonagall's timeline, as Crimes of Grindelwald seems to go against canon in a number of ways. This is my attempt to justify McGonagall being in CoG, let me know what you think!

A lot of people have commented on the fact that McGonagall was both a teacher in 1927 (when Dumbledore got questioned by the ministry) as well as around the time Newt attended Hogwarts (1908-1914). As she was said to only have worked at Hogwarts for 39 years, this would break canon as fans have concluded she should have been born in the 1930's.

I tried to reconstruct a timeline which is consistent with all facts presented to us by the Harry Potter books, Pottermore and the Fantastic Beasts films, without creating plotholes or breaking canon. It should also explain why Dumbledore was teaching DADA, when it is stated in the books that Merrythought had been working at Hogwarts as a teacher for 50 years. My theory is based on the fact that McGonagall states to Umbridge that she has been working at Hogwarts for 39 years, but it is not stated she worked there for 39 years consecutively.

This might all be far-fetched and a lot of effort to ensure putting McGonagall in Crimes of Grindelwald (CoG) isn't just a fanservice by Rowling, but if I'm correct the combination HP, Pottermore and Fantastic Beasts all add to a consistent timeline without breaking canon. If I'm missing facts, please comment and I'll try to fit them in the timeline.

First off, we know Dumbledore became Headmaster at Hogwarts after teaching Transfiguration (TF) for decades. I think we can safely say that McGonagall wasn't teaching Transfiguration at the time, since we have never seen multiple teachers at the same post in the HP world. If she would have started teaching TF the moment Dumbledore became headmaster (which was between 1966 and 1971, getting to that), she would have only worked at Hogwarts for 23-28 years in 1995. However, she says to Umbridge that she's been working at Hogwarts for 39 years. This would imply she worked for 11-16 years at Hogwarts before this period in time. My theory is that this period was in the Newt-era, as will become clear.

Secondly, Professor Merrythought is stated to have been teaching at Hogwarts for 50 years in 1945, *but not necessarily only DADA* (just as Minerva didn't have to have been teaching TF for 39 years consecutively). My theory relies on the fact that Merrythought was teaching another course in the time that Dumbledore took up the DADA-job. Let's say charms. We know some teachers are able to teach multiple courses as Snape teaches both Potions and DADA in the time Harry goes to school.

The following facts are supporting the timeline:

Professor Merrythought is stated to have been teaching at Hogwarts for 50 years in 1945 (but not only DADA!)

Albus was Transfiguration teacher when Mcgonagall went to school (Pottermore)

Minerva worked at the Ministry between the age of 18 and 20 (Pottermore)

Minerva started working at Hogwarts around the age of 20 (Pottermore)

Albus was Transfiguration teacher when, or until, Mcgonagall started working at hogwarts (Pottermore)

Minerva worked as a professor at Hogwarts between 1908-1914, Newts years (CoG)

Minerva worked as a professor at Hogwarts in 1927 (CoG)

Albus taught DADA in 1927 (CoG)

Albus was Transfiguration teacher in 1943, when Tom Riddle attended school (HP)

Albus has been teaching TF for decades before becoming headmaster (HP)

Lupin can attend hogwarts because Dumbledore becomes headmaster after he's been bitten by Fenrir. As he's born in 1960 and bitten shortly before turning 5, this puts the timeline between 1965 and 1971 (HP)

Dumbledore becomes headmaster between 1965 and 1971 (HP, Lupin)

Minerva worked at Hogwarts for 39 years in 1995 (HP)

Here it goes:

1881: Albus is born

1891: Minerva is born

1892: Albus starts at Hogwarts

1899: Albus sits his NEWTs

1902: Minerva starts at Hogwarts

1904: Albus starts teaching Transfiguration (give or take a few years)

1908: Newt starts at Hogwarts

1909: Minerva finishes hogwarts. By this time Albus was her TF teacher and has helped her with becoming an Animagus.

1910: After the summer, Minerva works at the ministry for 2 years

1912: Minerva sends an owl to Hogwarts, asking for a job. Dumbledore, the current TF professor replies that she can come teach. Here is where it get's shady and my theory begins:

By offering McGonagall a job, Dumbledore stops teaching TF, knowing she is very gifted in transfiguration and being a good friend of Minerva. He starts teaching DADA instead. This is either because there was a job opening in the DADA department or Dumbledore created one by saying Professor Merrythought should teach another course (Charms, for example). It would require a job opening for Charms, but let's say Mcgonagall's letter came at the right time and Dumbledore acted adequately on it.

Merrythought (DADA-&gt; Charms)

Dumbledore (Transfiguration -&gt; DADA)

McGonagall (Starts at transfiguration)

Why didn't Dumbledore just start teaching charms? Could also be the case, but we know he's teaching DADA. Maybe because this was one of his dreams, maybe because there actually was an opening in DADA:

Dumbledore(Transfiguration-&gt; DADA)

McGonagall (starts Transfiguration)

Either way:

1927: Albus is fired by the ministry as a DADA professor for not cooperating in the fight against Grindelwald. Mcgonagall recognizes her superior in Dumbledore, and feels she's in his debt since he helped her getting a job at Hogwarts. She offers him his old TF-job again, and quits in the proces. Merrythought starts teaching DADA (again, and the Charms position is filled either by Flitwick or another teacher).

At this time, the war is starting against Grindelwald and Minerva might have a role to play here. Anyway, from here till the late 1960's McGonagall goes off the radar.

Dumbledore (DADA-&gt; Transfiguration)

Merrythought (Charms -&gt; DADA)

McGonagall (quits)

1945: Merrythought quits. Riddle asks Dippet to become DADA teaches, Dippet refuses.

1960: Lupin is born

1965: Lupin is bitten by Fenrir. He thinks he cannot go to Hogwarts because of this.

Between 1965 and 1971: Dumbledore is appointed headmaster and Lupin is able to attend Hogwarts. This means Dumbledore became headmaster after Lupin is bitten, but before Lupin starts attending school (which is 1971). Let's say Dumbledore is appointed headmaster in 1971. The only other thing we know is that Riddle comes to Hogwarts a decade after he kills Hepzibah Smith, to ask for a DADA teaching job, which means he killed Hepzibah in 1961. As far as I know, there is nothing that disproves this.

1971: Dumbledore is appointed headmaster, just in time for Lupin to attend Hogwarts. By accepting, the Transfiguration post becomes vacant again. He asks his old friend Minerva to fill it, and she happily consents.

1995: McGonagall has been working again at Hogwarts for 23-24 years. Adding the time between 1912-1927 (which is 15-16 years), she could very well be working for 39 years at Hogwarts when she says at much to Umbridge.

This way, all facts I deemed relevant are woven together in a consistent (albeit far-fetched) timeline. If I missed additional facts which completely destruct this theory, please say so.

""A son cruelly banished, despair of the daughter, return great avenger with wings from the water""

&amp;#x200B;

We never find out why Ariana lashed out and killed her mother, Kendra, was it because of another baby?? Was the baby cruelly banished by Kendra for reasons unknown? (This one is a bit far-fetched but worth mentioning: Was Kendra trying to remove A's obscurious and give it to another child to allow Ariana to live ""Despair of the daughter""?) Any of these surely would have been upsetting to Ariana, and would have had the timing right for Grindelwald to have been in Godrick's Hollow to find out about the baby's existence. We have confirmation from the DH text that Kendra taught her children to keep secrets, so it is not out of the realm of possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

To help with the timeline (all dates are approximate):

1881 Albus born

1884 Aberforth born

1888 Ariana born

1893 Ariana was attacked 

June 1899 Kendra dies (said to be at Ariana's outburst)

August 1899 Ariana killed in the fight

1901 Leta's ship sank (Kendra was known to be dead for about a year) baby Credence was with his Aunt

Yusuf Kama says ""You are the winged raven returned from the sea, but I am the avenger of my family’s ruin."" about the last two sentences of the prophecy.

1002,pompeusz,1542724332,"So, one of the themes in original series is that it doesn't matter where you come from. You can be very well Muggle-born and still achieve great things. It's also important that Voldemort embrace his heritage as descendant of legendary wizard and dismiss his non-magical roots. He even value things of legendary ancestry as more powerful and worthy, like with his Horcruxes. It works well for most of time, but in the seventh book we learn that Harry is also descendant of powerful, ancient wizarding family (Perevells). So ultimately, despite the overall theme, we have chosen one destined to defeat evil wizard. It still works in some way because we have all those other characters that don't need ancient heritage to stand their own and the other themes include friendship, cooperation, he wouldn't done it all by himself anyway.

And then it turns out that the other most important person in defeating Voldemort, who also was the one to defeat the other world-threatening evil wizard, also comes from mighty family which even has it's own legends that also turn out to be true and they're basically associated with one of most powerful magical creatures. He also has far less flaws that Harry, he usually doesn't need any help it and when he ask for it it's because he himself found that it's the way to go and designed whole plan for others to follow (he knew that Harry will eventually defeat Voldemort and is the only one who can). Dumbledore is all powerful but he also happens to be part of family where everyone can get pet phoenix. Is there another family with such a strong trait? Perhaps the most close one is Perevells/Potter that are able to pass down valuable heirloom for generations that is also very strong magic item and has actual usage. So is Dumbledore such a might wizard because he is wise, patient, or caring or because he is just Dumbledore?

- Senior ministers of the government claim the right to go anywhere, anytime.

1011,MetalVenomLudens,1542703413,"I felt the movie was visually spectacular, plenty of interesting ideas with a phenomenal start and a promising end but the middle portion dragged and meandered too often. It gets lost in scenes that only serve a purpose to deliver exposition and intersecting subplots in a very contrived way to get to the the Climax over at Pére Lachaise cemetery (which I thought was brilliant), but overall the movie feels like filler for the most and quite light on narrative. I want to write a version of the movie that feels like a calm before the storm, a sense of foreboding is always present. Some of the characters who felt underdeveloped will receive a healthy amount of development (like Queenie, for instance). Queenie joining Grindelwald was truly heartbreaking and Alison Sudol really sells you on the tug that Queenie is now facing but it needed more development. 
That's the main problem with the movie, potentially brilliant stories get bogged down the weight they are under. In Harry Potter, the middle chapters often serviced a larger story but the journey was truly transformative, and rarely felt like filler. Crimes of Grindelwald would have been an easy classic if Rowling delivered on that front, the ideas are there, I think it's her lack of experience in screenwriting that's acting as an obstacle.

&gt;!So multiple Aurors shooting spells at Credence in Obscruial form in the first Fantastic Beasts movie could not kill him, but we are supposed to believe that a single rebounding spell from Dumbledore or Grindelwald prior to finding the elder wand was powerful enough to kill Ariana in Obscurial form?  I don't think so.!&lt;

&gt;!Plus, after only one wisp of Obscurial Credence survived, the wisp was able to regenerate his entire body.  I think Ariana never died, but part of her left the fight, maybe with a loss of memory so she did not come back after Grindelwald fled.  The Obscurial then possessed other hosts or just reformed a body until it eventually came to inhabit a baby.  That baby grew  up to be Credence Barebones.!&lt;

&gt;!I don't buy that Credence is biologically Albus Dumbledore's brother.  It would require Percival Dumbledore to escape Azkaban and father another child that nobody knew about.  And Grindelwald  as Graves did not know that Credence was a Dumbledore in the first movie.  He thought Credence was a Squib and thought the Obscurial would inhabit a girl form.  But he recognized the Obscurial as Ariana and comes to realize that Credence has essence of Dumbledore inside him.  So Credence is spiritually, not biologically, a Dumbledore.  But because the Obscurial has taken a male form, Grindlewald made up a male version of a name starting with an ""Ar"" sound when he called Ariana Dumbledore by the name Aurelius.  Credence hosting Ariana Dumbledore's spirit gets the Dumbledorian power to attract a phoenix, just like Harry got Parseltongue from a piece of Voldemort inside of him.!&lt;

&gt;!But who is the baby that Ariana Obscurial came to inhabit?  The baby is a Scamander.  That is why Dumbledore says, “I know this: an  Obscurus grows in the absence of love as a dark twin, an only friend.  If Credence has a REAL brother or sister out there who can take its  place, he might yet be saved.” !&lt;

&gt;!Dumbledore did not act like a real brother and give Ariana enough love to save he when he had the chance.  But he is sending Newt to do the job because he knows Newt is the real biological brother of the baby/host and might yet save Credence.!&lt;

&gt;!First, lets review the relevant canon:!&lt;

&gt;!The  main action of the movie The Crimes of Grindelwald takes place in 1927,  but the flashback takes place before Newt was expelled from Hogwarts.   He was expelled in his 5th or 6th year.  Assuming that Lupin taught from  the same curriculum as Dumbledore, Newt would have been in his 3rd year  when learning about Boggarts.   That places the flashback to 1910 (but  it could have been as late as 1913 if it happened just before he was  expelled.)!&lt;

&gt;!The  Minerva McGonagall we know was born October 4 1935 to Robert McGonagall  (Senior) and Isobel (McGonagall) Ross.  Isobel Ross was born in 1917.   The Minerva McGonagall at Hogwarts in 1910 is NOT Harry's Professor  McGonagall's mother either by name or timeline.!&lt;

&gt;!Isobel Ross' husband, Robert McGonagall Senior was a Muggle.  !&lt;

&gt;!Now the Theory:!&lt;

&gt;!Robert  McGonagall Senior was a Muggle.  But HIS father (only mentioned as Mr.  McGonagall) was a Squib who chose to go live as a Muggle because he had  no powers.  Mr. McGonagall and his wife Mrs. McGonagall raised their son  Robert with no knowledge of magic and were reportedly angry when Robert  eloped with the witch, Isobel.!&lt;

&gt;!But  the Squib Mr. McGonagall was actually born to a powerful magical  family.  He had an older sister named Minerva McGonagall who was a  talented witch who taught at Hogwarts.  !&lt;

&gt;!The  Minerva McGonagall in the movie The Crimes of Grindelwald is the aunt  of the Muggle Robert McGonagall and the great-aunt of Harry's Professor  McGonagall.  !&lt;

&gt;!Harry's  Professor McGonagall, although technically a half-blood because her  father was a Muggle, was a powerful witch who really did have magical  blood from both sides of her family.  Isobel named her daughter Minerva  after her own grandmother.

My theory on Jacob extends to Newts original explanation on Muggle vs Wizard physiology. Wizards and Muggles respond differently to poisons/antidotes and Newt took that into account while treating him. 

Next, I believe this is why Muggles were originally Obliviatived without affecting all the wizards in the same rain cleaning up. Physiological differences.

Now why did these effects only partially affect Jacob? I think  I have a theory.

 Jacob was bit by a magical creature, a Murtlap infact. Murtlaps have growths on their back that when picked and eaten help improve one's resistance to jinxes. (According to the original textbook- Fantastic Beast's and Where to find them) It's possible the antidote prepared by Newt, symptomatically managed Jacob's negative symptoms, but the positive effects remained in effect through the night. So Jacob wasn't totally affected by the obliviative rain. His physiology was altered by the Murtlap contamination.

Fun fact: Murtlap Essence is what Hermione used to heal Harry's hand after Umbridge's detention. ] /Spoiler

I believe this is a strategy that Grindlewald is using to abuse the Obscurous that Credence is. There is a scene, that in particular stands out that indicates to him not being a Dumbledore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Leta Lestrange has just stepped into an old classroom where her and Newt's initials are etched into a school desk. This brings her to a flashback, which shows her finding Newt in a hidden corner of Hogwarts. He finds a ""raven"" that is injured. Here's the thing, that wasn't a raven... later in the film you see Credence feeding the same type of bird, and at the end of the movie that bird becomes a phoenix. 

&amp;#x200B;

This scene with Newt shows that phoenixes are not exclusive to the Dumbledore family, and that it is possible to obtain one without the family name. Considering the final scene with Credence and Grindlewald, his only explanation as to why Credence is a Dumbledore is that a Phoenix comes to them in their time of need. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question here now is, where did Credence find the born again Phoenix? Was it from Grindlewald? Knowing that with his history with Albus, he knew that the Dumbledore family had a history with the bird. If the Phoenix theory is completely true as said in the film, then in this case, Newt would also be a Dumbledore descendent.

i’m just so confused as to why her timeline is so messed up. i see time turner theories, but there’s a maximum amount of time one can spend when using the time turner as to not mess with time itself/person who uses it. even if the ministry enforced the max 5 hour rule post dumbledore/grindelwald duel, wouldn’t her working at hogwarts before her birthday mess with her life path? the history we know of time turners would go against her traveling so far back—the history which, funnily enough, came from mcgonagall herself. see this excerpt from pottermore from professor croaker, unspeakable in charge of time (written by jo herself..sorry for formatting, i’m on mobile):

•”It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”. Finally, there were alarming signs, during the days following Madam Mintumble’s recovery, that time itself had been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up and since that time, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those studying time travel.

SO.  i get wanting to have a little wink to harry’s era, but i don’t understand having the familiarity component if it doesn’t add up to what we’ve learned from canon. we see what too much time travel can do (ex. cursed child...i know this is a contentious reference, sorry). i love mcgonagall so much (she’s the witch version of my middle school english teacher, who i adored) and i love her story, so i’m just kind of annoyed to have a wrench thrown into it haha.

After all, the story is supposed to be about The First Wizarding War and the legendary duel, both eminently mentioned in Harry Potter. Apparently, even the producers are backing out a little bit, if the title sequences of the two movies are of any indication (compared to the Harry Potter franchise).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img sxkoxus2lcz11...*

&amp;#x200B;

\- **So, why are you defending it?** \- you might ask.

It started out in the spirit of a devil's advocacy, but the more I think about it, the more I like the probable direction it's heading towards.

As most of you know, the Fantastic Beasts was supposed to be a single movie in the style of almost a documentary around the short textbook of the same title. For some reason, JK Rowling not only decided to write a screenplay herself but also expanded the content up to five installments to tell the story of the First Wizarding War. I doubt ""Fantastic Beasts"" was just a remnant of initial production title but perhaps something much more.

\- **Why ""Fantastic Beasts"" is fitting title so far?**

Alright, the first movie example is obvious. Newt, using the extract of Swooping Evil and magical eagle Frank, saves the wizarding world from exposure in NYC. Or when he seizes Grindelwald at the end of the movie using Swooping Evil. Crimes of Grindelwald is a little tricky. However, Niffler stealing that blood-bond amulet from Grindelwald in front of a large audience without anyone noticing considering its significance for certain future events is absolutely coherent to the movie title, IMHO.

&amp;#x200B;

[Grindelwald inspiring the audience \(with blood-bond amulet visibly attached to him\)](https://i.redd.it/cu3iwa35lcz11.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Most probably every movie will feature a magical creature contributing to the grand story in a meaningful way which so far has been preserved. The theme of ""*why we should be protecting these creatures instead of killing them*"" will continue to get stronger from a utilitarian perspective but I hope it will also divert to more of a Miyazakian sentiment of harmony with nature. However, that's not all of it.

In HP, **Voldemort underestimated the power of Love and Friendship** which eventually led to his demise. I bet **Grindelwald's weakness will feature the disregard and general apathy towards magical creatures**. A little bit of which we already saw in COG intro-sequence with Grindelwald tossing out a magical(?) lizard(?) for being too needy. Also, don't forget the end of the first movie where he essentially deflects every spell casted by dozens of aurors but fails to anticipate Newt's Swooping Evil.

Maybe this is just a wishful thinking but I would definitely love to see how magical creatures fit into the grand story going forward especially with respect to Grindelwald's personal downfall.

Hence, ladies and gentlemen, this is why **Fantastic Beasts is a great title for the franchise**.

Spielman accompanies Gellert Grindelwald and survives his outbreak without special reason if I remember correctly. [His wand](https://www.noblecollection.com/Item--i-PRP-FB-8073) is of special quality and a very specific wand too. (A german has to have a square wand... \^\^) What do you think about the greek style of his wand? Does it have a specific meaning?

&amp;#x200B;

We even know that [Nurmengard](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/3/3f/Nurmengard.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101021023225) (1) is located in Austria which has very close ties to Germany and will be the same nation during the second world war (and maybe is even so on the magical side of politics). We know because of a [interview](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-connection-between-Grindelwald-and-World-War-2-Has-Rowling-said-anything-explicit-about-this) with JKR that there are parallels between world war II and the war of the wizarding world at that time. So my thoughts on that are the following:  [Rudolph Spielman](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a1/Spielman.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/308?cb=20181107211327) and the politician [Kurt Schumacher](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/K.Schumacher.jpg/220px-K.Schumacher.jpg) (who opposed Adolf Hitler) look very much alike. So maybe he will be a major figure opposing Grindelwald and may as well be imprisoned like Schumacher was in real life. (We have seen him struggle to capture Grindelwald. This may be a satirical nod of the author.)

&amp;#x200B;

The name Spielmann is german for minstrel. This may be a clever reference to the work of Franz Schuberts[""Der Leiermann""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterreise#Der_Leiermann) (The minstrel) of the song cycle [""Winter Journey""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterreise). The minstrel in this song is deeply depressed and freezing, putting effort into his work without any progress. That is a pretty accurate description of the Head of Incarceration who landed in the freezing water of the atlantic ocean as a result of trying to capture Grindelwald. So why is he still alive? What are your thoughts on that matter?

&amp;#x200B;

After the fight of Grindelwald, Albus and Aberforth, resulting in the death of Ariana, Grindelwald becomes very interested in the power of Ariana like an obscurial. Thereafter, he begins to study this condition better. He discovers, then, that the vast majority of obscurials die very young, with Ariana being an exception. He also discovers that in the Dumbledore family there has been an equal case of Ariana, where an obscurian has managed to live far beyond normal. He comes to the conclusion that she has endured an obscurus for a longer time within herself precisely because she is a Dumbledore. Knowing this, Grindelwald plans a new Dumbledore baby.

Grindelwald helps Percival escape from Azkaban. Percival goes to meet his family, but on arrival he discovers everything that happened. Then he meets Honoria. Honoria is Albus's aunt, but it is not known whether she is the sister of Kendra or Percival, but for this theory to work she must be Kendra's sister. Persuaded by Grindelwald, Honoria seduces Percival to have a child. The son is born and is Aurelius Dumbledore. However, after the birth of her son, Honoria resists to hand him to Grindelwald. Honoria flees on a ship to the USA, where her family lives. In the books it is said that Kendra looked like a Native American, so if Honoria is her sister she would be Native American too. Then all the facts that are shown in The Crimes of Grindelwald happen.

1076,Overjay,1542633288,"Hi everyone. I am a long time Harry Potter universe fan, read all the books and saw all the movies. When I came out from the theater after FantasticBeasts I was very pleased - it had a lot of new stuff, nicely fixed into existing universe. Moreover, it expanded the lore on magical creatures, which in my opinion were integral part of the world all along, so it is consistently ""magical"". It was OK plotwise, not complicated, not stupid, characters were sane, believable.

But not in Crimes of Grindelwald. Ok, first things first. What WERE the crimes? All we are shown is that he is most wanted revolutionary, who wants to get wizards in control of muggles, because they are dumb in short. Typical arch-villain with dictatorship ambitions, we had similar shit with Voldemort, but he was a magical nazi dude. But with Voldemort we were told that he killed lots of people, had a private army of death eaters and killed Harry's parent's for security reasons. Not with Grindelwald. What we are shown is that what he wants, but not his motivation. And that he and Dumbledore were gay and loved each other. That's all. No crimes. 

I also did not like neither Johnny Depp as Grindelwald nor the character appearance at all. I did not understood those boots, what's up with those? The dude is clearly not a goth, and nobody around wears that stuff since you can warm and dry yourself with a wand. White eye-villain? That was a cliche imo. And Johnny Depp. I like him, but not in this movie. This villain should've been charismatic revolutionary, flaming human torch of ""progress"". Not an overgrown edge-lord, with no facial mimic whatsoever. Gary Oldman could've been a good choice for the role, but he is too british for the ""german"" descent hero. But he at least has living facial muscles.

Queenie situation and motivation is just plain dumb. Queenie is a rare person, who sees into other's minds clearly. She sees true colors of each around her, and falls in love with Jacob because of that, he is a great human being. Then, with that much of insight of humans, she naturally should be a very wise one too, since she saw A LOT of shit around her, and must've learned on that. And it was like that in previous movie. 

But not in Crimes. Here we see a semi-hysterical damsel, who is driven with need be wed, even though she knows Jacob's reasons of declining that and so on. The even bewitches him with that love potion, which is plainly crazy, and then after their reunion at the end of the movie, she joins Grindelwald FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. The only reason I could think of is that JK Rowling wanted a ""good"" character in overall team of baddies, so somebody would be kind in edge-lord's evil castle in next movies. 

Newt and Tina situation is unnecessary, it is a plot device to get Newt to Paris to do Dumbledore's chores. Oh well. This is Dumbledore at his prime, as manipulative as his lover. Believable. 

I loved that Jude Law was chosen as Dumbledore, he's a great actor. I don't think the dark side of everyone's beloved professor will be shown in the next movies, but I can bet that Jude will nail it.

Creedence and Nagini. It is interesting who are Creedence parents, but it is more interesting how Nagini eventually sides with wizard nazis. I also don't thing Creedence is THAT powerful everyone are led to believe, since that final mountain artillery session is not something exceptional in wizarding world, there are spells and trinkets for that.

Leta Lestrange is overall useless to the plot and can be harmlessly removed, along with Creedence being Corvus, and how Leta is bad, and bla-bla-bla. Honestly, her school years flashback does not show her as bad. ""You talk shit about me? now you don't, tall biatch"". I also dont think Zoë Kravitz did an outstanding job of the character, as I saw every review state this. She seemed very tired ALL THE TIME. No facial mimic. Only somber glanses from under the brows and edgy, teen grade problems. Also, since Corvus and Leta are dead, who held the Lestrange name onwards into Belatrix Lestrange? Missing chain.

Conclusion: JK Rowling needs help with writing, or has to be a consultant who sets the universe around, not the heros and their characters. The only bright thing for me in this movie was chinese dragon-cat, who looked cool, had cool abilities and more or less sane sequences, that did not wither my eyes with flashes as intro testral-driven carriage chase.

It seems like Jo thought the audience might think it's neat to hear that name and see a young McGonagall and then she didn't go check her previous writing on the matter so now it's muddying up the timelines.

Credence's age is a bit thrown with this movie because it says he was adopted in 1904, but that the shipwreck happened in 1901, meaning Credence was born somewhere around 1901, but that would make him 25 years old in the first Fantastic Beasts movie and that seems unlikely that at 25 he would still be hanging around Mary Lou Barebone and letting her treat him like that. It also means that he is pretty close to Newt's age and yet Jo continually writes in the scripts other characters referring to him as ""kid"".

*""You have magical ancestry but no power""..He seemed pretty confident on that fact when he said that.*

Grindelwald also says *""The Obscuriel was here, where did she go?""*

The third part to the story is the scene where Jacob sees the Obscurus that Newt was hiding..
Newt asks him to stay away firmly even though later he says the Obscuriel is harmless..
So does that hint that an Obsurus can take a host body to survive?(Though that will not be the first case where a wizard takes another body as a host)
As many have theorised the Obscurus inside Creedance is infact Ariana herself..
But if my calculations are right Creedance is a squib who attains magical powers when hes taken as host by Ariana's Obscuriel which makes him a spiritual brother to Albus.

The biggest issue I have is that Credence isn’t even old enough to be the child on the ship. The screenplay of CoG says that the shipwreck occurred in 1901. That would make Credence at least 26 in 1926 when the first movie takes place. Ezra Miller states in an interview that Credence is 18 in 1926, putting his birth year at 1908, 7 years after the shipwreck. Is it possible that Credence isn’t even related to the shipwreck at all? Why would he have Irma Dugard on his adoption papers if he isn’t even old enough to be the child on the shipwreck?

Rowling has used the concept of same blood before too when Voldemort gets Lily's protection through Harry's blood. So in this case if Credence and Grindelwald cannot fight against each other it serves Grindelwald well.

1086,True_Panda,1542615268,"Apologies in advance if this was obvious through other source material.

As we saw, the current events of the movie took place in 1927. WWII began in 1939 and ended in 1945 with Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

What was interesting to me is that the movie seemed to heavily imply that the wizarding world had a profound effect on the muggle events and there has been a secret movement/war themselves. 

One of the events that historians will cite as the beginning of WWII is in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. The Nazi/Hitler comparisons to Grindelwald can and has been beaten to death but worth noting. But also noting that Jacob Kowalski is Polish, and the ""muggle"" role in these movies. 

This would indicate that in a future movie, 1939 will feature Grindelwald launching an attack against muggles that influences the real world events of WWII. Perhaps there is an actual connection or influence of Grindelwald to Hitler as a catalyst, drawing from his emphasis of muggle ""value"" as if they were tools or ""beasts of burden"".

Another piece of theory are the end dates of both major events. WWII ended in 1945 with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the same year Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald in their epic duel. Perhaps their duel took place in Japan, their duel being destructive to the level of nuclear weapons. Maybe the bombs resulted in being the only way to cover up the damage caused, unable to be fixed by magic or have too many muggle deaths to cover up. The events of WWII and the way the wizarding world intertwined itself with muggle affairs may have shaped the culture between muggle governments and the ministry of magics. 

In the early events of the *Half-Blood Prince* when Cornelius Fudge meets the British Prime Minister, they discussed the recent disasters such as the Brockdale Bridge snapping, 2 murders, and the sudden hurricane in West Country. 

""How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicised murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property?""

“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge… the Bones and Vance murders… not to mention the ruckus in the West Country…”

“You–er–your–I mean to say, some of your people were–were involved in those–those things, were they?”

Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. “Of course they were,” he said, “Surely you've realised what’s going on?”

It seems like muggle governments and the ministry of magic have an expectation and duty for muggle governments to cover up the damages and influences of the wizarding world, as if it was set by precedent and prior events. Undoubtedly there have been many cases where this needed to be done but the events of Grindelwald emphasized the need for cooperation for the sake of both magic and muggle civilians.

1098,NinjaInPlainSight,1542591871,"*this is all about The Crimes of Grindelwald, so spoilers below* 

At the end of the movie, when Grindelwald gives his big reveal [about Credence's identity as a Dumbledore](#spoiler), I think Grindelwald is intentionally lying. This is such a huge thing to add to the canon for no real good reason, so I think Grindelwald made it up to manipulate [Credence](#spoiler) and Rowling wrote it to psyche us out. 

Here's my reasoning: 
1) Grindelwald was there when Ariana died and knows how that affected Albus. 
2. I still think that Grindelwald is interested in obscuriouses, and the potential of Credence being the oldest and most powerful one ever.  This whole movie was about manipulating Credence and getting him to think that Grindelwald has information no one else does, which we also saw him do in the first one as Graves. This lie gets Credence on his side, and if he can give Credence a name and reason for his power that he doesn't hate himself for, he will value himself and that relationship. And now Grindelwald has a legit magical cannon at his disposal. 
3) This is going to mess with Albus so hard. If [Grindelwald can throw an unknown brother into the battle that also brings up the old feeling about Ariana that we already saw when Dumbledore was talking to Leta, Albus is going to falter, without a doubt.](#spoiler) 
4) Dumbledore is already known as a great wizard, so this lie will validate [Credence and give him something to hang onto tightly, this knowledge of his power and great lineage, when everyone else is fighting to take it away from him. Grindelwald will be the only one he can trust.](#Spoiler)
5) Until, of course, it is revealed that Grindelwald has been lying. This will break [Credence's trust and revert him (and probably Queenie) back to Tina and Newts side](#spoiler) and setting the stage for the final battle of Dumbledore v Grindelwald. 

Grindelwald lying here makes sense for the characters and the plot; it sets the stage for Dumbledore to open up about Ariana to Newt and strengthen the desire to defeat Grindelwald on a personal level and gets people talking about the movie for a little while.

I think it makes more sense than a secret brother they didn't know about. Because if Arianna killed mom when she's 14, and Dumbledore was recently graduated, then we could assume that Credence should be only about 17 years younger than Albus if they share the same mother.

It also makes sense in Harry Potter lore that hatred and evil beget more hatred and evil. Likewise, Arianna, unloved and poorly treated would have a child that suffers the same fate.

I personally believe it is evident that Credence is being manipulated by Grindelwald  and he is not related to Dumbledore. However, he is an obscurial with immense power who has survived into adulthood and has learned to somewhat control it. It is a parasitic magical force that drains an individual of their life force/ magic. He should have perished earlier on. Perhaps he has immense magical power. What other families that are known to have immense magical skill or power? I am speculating he is  truly a Gaunt. It is a stretch with little basis but what if he is the son of Marvolo Gaunt? It is interesting that it is never mentioned who is the wife of Marvolo and the mother of Morfin and Merope. What if she fled the Gaunt family for a reason ( affair with a muggle?) and took Credence with her. What if Credence was something considered undesirable by the Gaunt family ( a half blood) . Perhaps the wife of Marvolo and the baby Credence was thought to have perished on the ship and no one knew that he lives. It explains how no one would ever mention anything about Marvolo’s wife as she may have brought shame to the Gaunt family, as she is likely to also be a Gaunt due to inbreeding. What if Marvolo’s Abusive and sadistic actions towards his own daughter Merope when she  lusted for a muggle where the result of his wife having an Ilicit affair with a muggle?

*“A son cruelly banished,* despair *of the daughter, return great avenger with wings from the water”*

\- from the Predictions of Tycho Dodonus

My favorite character in the first Fantastic Beasts film was Queenie, who has a heartbreaking but understandable turnaround in this new film – what can I say? I like the conflicted characters best. 

Which brings me to Yusuf Kama, also very conflicted. He was obsessed with Tycho’s predictions, and assumed they referred to his family and to himself. But do they? I’m also more interested in his Unbreakable Vow. If he was sworn to avenge his family on the “person who Corvus Lestrange loved best in the world” (Or something like that; if the wording on that’s off, please tell me what you remember!), has he achieved that? And if so, what happens to you and your Unbreakable Vow? If you can’t achieve it, you die. But it’s obvious that Yusuf isn’t dead, at least, not yet. Does an Unbreakable Vow have more to do with what you *believe* you have or haven’t done, or does it have to do with what you’ve *actually* done?

Yusuf assumes that the person Corvus Lestrange loved most was Leta’s little brother, also named Corvus Lestrange, who she abandoned to be accidentally killed. But if Yusuf is still alive, that means one of two things: either little Corvus is still alive, or little Corvus isn’t the one Corvus Lestrange Sr. loved best. It obviously wasn’t Lita that her father loved best, by her own and Yusuf’s admission, and when she died, Yusuf was still fine and dandy, too. So how does he resolve this Unbreakable Vow? What do you think?

There’s also the idea of whether Corvus and Lita may or may not be the ones referred to in Tycho’s predictions. Who do you think they refer to?",FantasticBeasts,Yusuf Kama and the Unbreakable Vow (spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9y8iq5/yusuf_kama_and_the_unbreakable_vow_spoilers/,1542538014.0

1140,carlashaw,1542544231,"Ive only seen the film once so far so these opinions might change but this is my impression so far:
     I enjoyed the film, it wasnt perfect but not for the reasons most people are listing. First off, its very clear that JKR had trouble translating her novel writting ability to script writting for this complex story. There are too many scenes where characters have to rely on using a spell or device to explain the past or their feelings (the mirror, travers spell showing dumbledores past, letas family tree, the weird pensive in a desk thing at newts hearing etc) and I don't think this is evidence of a too convoluted plot, just one where more detail and background information are needed than films usually rely on. It also seems clear to me that a lot of scenes were cut or condensed for the final version, whether they were filmed or not. Like a more fleshed out introduction between Yusuf and Tina, I thought Tina just saying ""I think we are looking for the same thing"" then going for tea with a stranger or how Nagini had like 3 lines in the film. It felt a bit lazy but there are several seens that felt this way and we know JKR doesnt write like that which is why I think these scenes were condensed to save on time. Now as for all the cannon breaking stuff (McGonagall, Dumbledore teaching DADA, that spell thing Newt did to show the past) I can more easily forgive this stuff. I know how cinema works and know that production companys want to capitalize on nostalgia and familiarity to boost sales so it doesnt suprise me that they wanted stuff like that in the films. This is why its important to take everything in these films with a grain of salt, while yes it is JKR story and on the whole should be considered cannon, WB also has their fingers in this pie and will occasionally get their way. JKR had them go back and edit the wand Jude Law originally used while filming out because she, quite rightly thought it looked too much like the elder wand. This shows she still cares about the story and keeping things consistent but its very unlikely she will win every battle with WB over what goes into these films.
     Now for the story, which I thought was really good just too complex for a film. I love the mystery behind Credences identity. As for the big ""reveal"" at the end, of course Grindelwald is lying to manipulate him, Grindelwalds powers of persuasion and manipulation were built up from the very first scene. And speaking of Grindelwald, I thought Johnny Depp actually did a good job with him. I was dreading a typical over the top JD performance but what we got was a lot more subtle and nuanced so I was content. By far the best scene in the film was his speech and I have to say his vision of the future is a very compelling argument (speaking of, i think the biggest crime of Grindelwald is that he vapes). Jude Law also did well as Dumbledore, nothing too special but fitting at least.  As for the Queenie situation, did anyone NOT see this coming? I really wish we would have gotten at least one more film with Leta, who by the way died the dumbest death... And Nicolas Flammel suffered from the same problem as Nagini. 
      My final verdict is that the film itself was okay but the story on its own was much better . It definitely would have been more suited for novel form but what can you do.

1143,CasuallyCrumbling,1542540300,"Newt is one the characters that I am the most invested in when it comes to this movie franchise, that’s why I’m really intrigued with his relationship with Leta and then Theseus. If your not interested, no one is forcing you to read on!

So,

What I take away from the movie is that Newt and Leta did love each other while in Hogwarts, but Newt never confessed his love and Leta just assumed he thought of her as just a friend. Theseus comes along, Leta then falls in love with him, and Newt is obviously devastated because of this.  

I’ve heard a lot of people saying that Newt still liked her romantically and Leta vice versa (I think because of that beginning scene with Newt looking slightly dazed at seeing Leta again. )

The love that Newt and Leta have now (or at least had post-Hogwarts) is one of friendship and companionship. Both of them wanting to look out for each other and protect one another. HOWEVER to Newt, Leta will also be the what if, the alternative life with someone he could love and be happy with. Also Newt never really got to confess his feelings for Leta, so there might be some slight repression going on.

Those two factors make for a weird dynamic between them. Leta probably realises this to some extent, however she is now perfectly happy with Theseus so she isn’t really in the position to make this dynamic less weird. Theseus definitely see this and feels slightly guilty for hurting his brother in that way (thus the estranged relationship.)

Tina represents something new and different and Newt is falling fast for someone he both respects and feels happy to be around. (That whole scene in the ministry was so sweet and lovely, LOVED IT). 

Just my two knuts, hopefully in the next movie we’ll get some self reflection from Newt in regards to Leta, and I feel like he would have to tackle some of those repressed feelings he couldn’t confess years ago to truly move along with Tina.

&gt;!Credence is the only weapon that can stop Dumbledore. Only with his help Grindelwald can defeat Dumbledore.  Only Credence has no reason whatsoever to hate Dumbledore in any way. He does not even know him. This is how the brilliant idea of ​​Grindelwald comes into play:  The only way to gain his trust is to give him an identity. That is his greatest wish, his desire, who he really is. It would be easy to put him in the Dumbledore's family and at the same time give him a reason to be familiar with Dumbledore. That's why you would think that Credence is a danger so he must be destroyed. Just by that strong wizard: Albus Dumbledore.  The trust is reinforced by the fact that he finally gives him his own wand. Also the phoenix, which appears at the same time. I rather think that Grindelwald has enchanted the little bird, that he is now transforming back into his magnificent shape of a full-grown phoenix. Grindelwald has been able to show his art of transformation throughout the film. So it would have been easy for him to reconvert the phoenix before Credence and associate the name Dumbledore with it.  !&lt;

This may have been a reason that Grindelwald is looking for an obscurus consistently, as they are powerful, and why Dumbledore started the duel that killed his sister, once he saw what Grindelwald wanted to use her for (he succeeded in killing his sister, as it wasn’t a proper duel due to the *blood pact*, just Grindelwald trying to protect Dumbledore’s sister aka his tool for power).

The reality that Albus Dumbledore is Aurelius’ father, an intimate fact that someone like Grindelwald would have known.

One thing I disagree is a negative reception of Grindelwald. I do not see him as a black character (neutral at the most) and he was not described as such in HP books, in my opinion. 

He was depicted as a villain mostly by popular beliefs based on negative press founded on his conflict with Ministry of Magic, however it was never clear whether he was a bad person or not. 

Same happened with Harry and even Dumbledore in Voldemort times. He just did not have a chance to win some great fight with a threat to the society, to please the masses. In my opinion he was a scapegoat for the failures of magical government which was probably criticized after I WW as passive and too isolationist. Kind of the enemy of the society strawman used a lot in XX century.

In my opinion his beliefs are mostly leaning to the liberty, however there are couple of unfair comments from his side (muggles as servants). Maybe it's my wishful thinking but I saw these comments as deceitful - to appeal to the most radical followers. His true beliefs were revealed in the final speech, which was very freedom oriented and rejected the bigotry. His pledge to lead the humanity to avoid the massive carnage was in a way pacifist, however the paternalism is visible here. On the other hand his followers (not him) are killing people, which was little bit over the top and too edgy for me. However, the Ministry does the same, so...

I don't know if it was made on purpose but I see the negativity of Grindelwald as a very feeble smokescreen for his real beliefs. There were of course slight references to the Nazi ideology e.g. lebensraum, but I saw them as forced and artificial.

It will be interesting to see how the story continues towards 1945 when Dumbledore will duel him. Reveal of Aurelius might suggest that in order to protect his family's and his own reputation, Dumbledore could be e.g. forced by the Ministry to break his blood fraternity vows and fight Grindelwald.

Maybe I'm going too far and deep here, but I would love to see the other side of some beloved and hated characters. It would make the lore far more interesting.

1159,redblackcherry,1542524596,"I went to see the move only once so far, and I went alone to an opening day showing here. It was the last showing of the night, at 1030, and the theater was quite empty...how that bodes for the film's success in general I don't know, but I live in Sun Coast Florida and I'm not sure how many real HP/JKR fans are around here anyway...the demographics skew pretty old.  

I also read the official screenplay, which helped a lot...more on how there's so much going on in this movie later.

I will see it several times more, I'm sure, but these are first impressions:

I should set this up by saying I LOVED the first film, and the way I came to it was, with very little knowledge.  I had actually forgotten the film was coming/had come out (rather preoccupied in that period)!  When it struck me that OH, YEAH, THE NEW HP/FB MOVIE'S OUT!  I hadn't been following it, I hadn't even been following trailers.  So it was largely a completely spoiler-free, unknown quantity discovery for me from the the beginning, and I think that added hugely to my enjoyment when I jumped into the new Wizarding World.  I was enchanted, with just about everything, and I'm saying this as a pretty serious Potterhead - read the entire saga/seen all the movies several times over the past (gasp) 20 years.  I liked just about everything about FB I, from the treatment of American Wizardry (I'm an American) to the wonderful characters/acting. (I mean, to me it's kind of amazing to see such really fine acting in what is, a freaking fantasy franchise that I didn't at first see as primarily aimed at adults anyway.  In the Potter films, this was a bit hit and miss, especially with the earlier films and so many very young actors.)   I was hooked, and waiting two years for the next installment was kinda tough.

I decided on coming to CoG the same way as I had the first; knowing as little as possible about it so it would be a complete discovery.  And I'm glad I did it that way, but I need to say, I think it was kinda rough emotionally, because the second film is 1) SO MUCH DIFFERENT IN TONE and 2) has SO MUCH GOING ON IN IT.  It was almost like a physical assault, if that's not overstating it too much...

And after having your emotions yanked this way and that for over two hours...the plot, per se, really hasn't advanced all that much.  I mean, as so many others have commented, that this movie was more about exposition and positioning than anything else.  There are important new characters we have to meet, but just meet them is really all we do.  And things are serious now. People die, and not just off-camera. Relationships are real work...tangled and fraught with complications and pain. 

The purpose of this movie in the plot of the series is, as has been expressed by the creators, for everybody to take their stand.  In particular Newt, as the key character, has to choose whether he will fight or not.  He's deliberately spent his entire life as far removed from human society's concerns as he could get.  When we first met him, all he cares about is his creatures (and that's deeply), and it's been that way a long time.  But now something (and someone) has come along and he can't play it that way anymore.  He tries, but he is finally pushed into action by those few people he's let close to him, who directly challenge him in their own ways to take a side.

That's the main reason why poor Leta dies, after what seems to be such a raw deal in life.  (Yet we never really discover (yet) exactly what drove she and Newt apart, do we? Nor do we find out (yet) just why Newt was expelled from Hogwarts. I'm pretty sure those things are coming.)  I felt really awful about two things in this movie, really grieved: her death, in a way a suicide, and Queenie's seduction by Grindelwald.  Both in part because of the pain their losses cause the other characters.  I can't get thru this enough for myself, how in a frickin' fantasy about magic how much people really hurt in this one movie.  Industrial-strength hurt. Others have noted that in the Potter saga JKR took several books to build to this emotional pitch, this level of darkness, but here she's got it cranked to 10 already, and virtually everybody has pain of existential quality, especially the three remaining principles at the end, but we've also got Dumbledore's and Nagini's and Theseus's, and you can't tell me Credence/Aurelius is a happy camper, he's a bitter, enraged one, and Queenie flat out doesn't really know what she's doing. AND we have Newt and Tina's relationship struggles and angst, altho that's balanced with the tenderest scene ever created in all of the Wizarding world so far.

Basically, I just wanted to vent all this somewhere, and I've done it.  I'll be giving the movie more viewings over the next (sigh) two years, but it's gonna hurt.  It's that kinda film...but it's also absolutely amazing to watch its design.  I've heard it called the most beautiful movie made this year, and I can see it.",FantasticBeasts,Just some things about CoG,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9y42kj/just_some_things_about_cog/,1542495796.0

Here are some that I can think of:

Dumbledore explaining to Newt that he was not seeking power, similar to Harry not seeking power. And Dumbedore being somewhat manipulative in the way of getting others to do his bidding in some scenarios. 

&amp;#x200B;

Grindelwald's rise to power follows very similar ideology to Hitler's rise in power, and is about the same time period. Both were incredibly persuasive, and gradually changed their aims as they gained support. Beginning with it being all about freedom, to gaining momentum and turning it primarily against Jews/NoMaj

He can't and nobody else will. What better way to turn Creedence against this person he doesn't know than to manipulate his desire for family against him?](/spoiler)

[Not sure how the phoenix factors in, though. I must have missed how Credence came into possession of it. But I'm willing to bet that it is Fawkes and that it will end up with Albus.](/spoiler)

[I am still at a loss figuring out the story with Leta and how she got away from Barebone to go to Hogwarts and why any wizard would send their kid to live with her in the first place and how Leta just happened to pick up another magical child. Was the boat full of wizards?](/spoiler)

[And how was Creedence able to cast anything with a wand that didn't choose him with no practice at all?](/spoiler)

[Lastly, how does Yusuf's unbreakable vow resolve now? He's still alive after Leta died (TOO SOON) so LeStrange's male heir must still be alive...](/spoiler)

[I absolutely LOVED seeing the French ministry and all the new animals, though.](/spoiler)

[I hope Queenie comes back around but it's great to see her betrayal as an example of the allure  of Grindlewald's message. As opposed to Voldemort where everyone who followed him (with few exceptions) were already ""evil"" leaning.](/spoiler)

We, as far as I can tell, have no freaking idea what the blood pact between Albus and Grinderwald was???

However, it's likely that it isn't what it was implied to be.

You wanna know why?

Because Albus had dueled Grindlewald previously. That three way duel between Grindelwald, Albus and his brother Alberforth is when a stray spell hit and killed their younger sister Ariana.

If the blood pact, which I assume must of happened before the death of Ariana, kept the two from dueling each other one of the following would have to be true.

A) Graves or Albus would of died an excruciatingly painful death due to the broken oath.

B) The oath doesn't keep them from dueling eachother like Albus seems to imply. It could even keep them from harming or killing each other, but Albus is clever and could find a way to subdue Graves without harming him.

I have kept in mind that they were likely to have been in a romantic relationship, but if Albus was willing to fight him then, why not now? Why not after his sister's death? 

It's a possibility that the oath keeps them from directly betraying each other when it comes to their plans.

“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

― Albus Dumbledore, (J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)

&amp;#x200B;

So, here we go.

If you look at the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them films together so far as a thinker’s fable, they make a lot more sense. It has much less to do with plot and much more to do with who these characters are, how they change, and what they ultimately (will) become. The stories have a moral (or several), and a cast of characters who change and grow from some progression of their experiences. Both of the current movies felt much more character-driven than plot-driven to me.

And there’s always a twist at the end of a fable, a final reveal or trick played on one character or more that changes your understanding of what you thought you were observing. J.K. Rowling seems to really enjoy that style of storytelling, the whodunnit, the surprise reveal, the man behind the curtain. That sort of thing.

Each character is driven by the choices they make. I thought this was done extremely well in Crimes of Grindelwald, as the second chapter in a five-part story – it functions better that way than if you’re trying to view it only on its own. Kind of like if you looked at Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets alone and tried to make sense of it apart from the other books or films.

If each character is a thread in the Hogwarts Sorting Hat – not that they each have houses at Hogwarts, but that each thread is its own story and also a part of the whole – in Crimes of Grindelwald, there are at least eight main threads to follow with their own twists and, hopefully, future continuation of their stories: Newt, Tina, Queenie, Jacob, Albus Dumbledore, Credence, Nagini, and Grindelwald. I’m not including Lita Lestrange because it looks like she won’t be in future movies, since she sacrifices herself at the end of this one. Although she should be considered a minor thread, too, like every character who lives in the HP world. And all of those threads are driven by their choices.

Newt Scamander: 

Newt’s choices change throughout Crimes of Grindelwald are natural and seamless, going from a refusal to be any part of the ministry’s search for Credence or Grindelwald to finally choosing to fight alongside the brother who is both a rival and a nuisance to Newt for the sake of his friends and what is right. Like Dumbledore says, Newt doesn’t seek power or popularity. He’d rather be in the company of his nonhuman friends than his human ones. But he does ask what is right. And that is what drives his ultimate choices.

Tina Goldstein:

I thought the way the rivalry she felt with Lita Lestrange and the humor derived from Newt’s preoccupation with her eyes played out beautifully. The scene between them in the French Ministry of Magic when they finally understand one another is one of the best parts of the movie. And while her relationship with Newt definitely drives her to a certain degree, she also chooses apart from her distressed feelings to be the Auror who goes after Credence and tries to do what is right. She’s a good match for Newt in that way.

Queenie Goldstein:

Queenie is a free spirit who is constantly driven by her feelings. She feels shackled in more than one way. Her abilities as a Legilimens complicate this, because she can hear other people’s thoughts, and because of this is also very empathic, feeling other people’s feelings even when she doesn’t want to, and it overwhelms her. At a certain point, she just chooses to feel calm and safe again, and Grindelwald gives her that choice. He promises her freedom from the laws that keep her world hidden, and the future promise of being able to love who she wants to love, no-maj or not. It didn’t surprise me that she chose Grindelwald, although it was breaking my heart, and I was rooting for her to turn back the entire time.

Jacob Kowalski:

Jacob has a heart of gold, not much guile or deceit in him – part of why Newt likes him so much more than other people he meets. His love story is so sad thus far; Jacob loves Queenie completely, and returns to her every time, even when understanding her is difficult for him – he is more flippant than he should be in his use of the word “crazy”, which hurts Queenie. Still, his choice to accept her through every setback should have told her what kind of man she was trying to control, but she still can’t see it. She can hear his thoughts, but she can’t see his heart. She reacts to his confusion instead of to his love for her. I also thought the relationship Jacob has with Newt was fantastic. They just compliment each other so well, even though they’re from such different worlds. 

Albus Dumbledore:

This was such a great casting choice. Jude Law simply \*is\* Dumbledore as a younger man. In the HP movies, I loved Richard Harris, but Michael Gambon, while a fantastic and well-respected actor with a background in Shakespearean theater, was not Dumbledore for me, with his anger and heavy-handed show of his power, vs. the calm and surprisingly strong Dumbledore of the books. Jude Law has the power beneath his calm exterior. He wasn’t in the movie as much as I’d have liked, but we did find out why he couldn’t fight Grindelwald. So, he chose Newt instead. Did anyone else notice the way the vial which held the blood pact between him and Grindelwald looked a lot like the shapes of the three Deathly Hallows? Someone’s probably talking about that somewhere else online, and I just haven’t seen it yet. Hah!

Credence Barebone/Aurelius Dumbledore:

His choices are driven by his desire to know where he came from and who he is. He’s a very malleable character in that he follows the first string to whoever will give him the answers, no matter if that person is good or evil, which makes him incredibly dangerous. But Newt believes in him, so I will, too. This could be his redemption story in the Fantastic Beasts films. I do wonder if he will end up being connected to Fawkes (and thus Dumbledore later) or to Ariana’s obscurus. One theory I’ve seen online is that he is Ariana’s son. She was only six when she was attacked, but it destabilized her, and if she had ever given birth later as a young teenager to a son, her instability might have dictated that he be sent away – this theory both horrifies and saddens me. I hope it isn’t true. I suppose Credence/Aurelius could also be Aberforth’s son. The last possibility might be that Grindelwald was talking to the obscurus inside Credence as “Dumbledore’s brother”, because Dumbledore’s sister was also an obscurial. If none of these are the case, the difference in age between Albus and Aurelius will have to have an equally compelling resolution. All this is assuming that Grindelwald isn’t outright lying to Credence to manipulate his actions.

Nagini:

She’s intriguing, but so far, all the choices we’ve seen her make involve her being friends with Credence and trying to do what’s best for him. His choice to try to free her has won her loyalty in helping him to obtain whatever information he can about his family origins. It was also interesting to see her set up as someone in the camp of Dumbledore and Newt, rather than in Grindelwald’s camp. This makes me wonder whether she will change to follow the “Dark Side” later down the road, if she is a spy in the enemy camp, or if there were just a lot of cuts to the movie which ended up being scenes that explained Nagini’s motivations.

Gellert Grindelwald:

Johnny Depp as Grindelwald made no sense to me in the first movie, as much as I loved it. He didn’t really get much of a chance to do anything, though, until this movie, and I have to say that he won me over in the role. It was easy to see how seductive his reasoning must have been to the wizards who had been pent up for so long in so many ways. He’d gather a combination of bullies, those seeking power and those disillusioned by life as it is now living beside the muggles. As a master manipulator, he was perfect. If it weren’t for the ominous music (the score to this movie was so very hauntingly beautiful in every way), I’d say that the part was perfectly written, but the music told us in no uncertain terms that there was something wrong, if we didn’t happen to catch it for ourselves. It seems he has a love/hate relationship to Albus Dumbledore, but his choices center around knowing that he either can’t fight him (because of the blood pact), or even if he could, quite possibly can’t defeat him. So, he seems to be manipulating Credence/Aurelius to do it for him.

At any rate, for a film called Fantastic Beasts, there wasn’t as much as I would have liked of the fantastical beasts, which is a huge part of why I love these stories. There were some great scenes with Newt asking his assistant (who had some very Smitten-with-Newt vibes going on) to do various chores to take care of his beasts; and the parts of the movie which involved the Zouwu or the Phoenix were absolutely beautiful to watch. Humor with the Zouwu’s cat-toy, Pickett the Bowtruckle, and the baby Nifflers, etc. wasn’t quite so heavy-handed as in the last film, which made it more enjoyable – and I liked the last movie a lot. But this time the humor came more naturally. And for me, the fantastic beasts made this movie the magical world the HP stories are for me, because we already know so much about the magical world through Harry’s eyes. Here, we get to relive that wonder through still more magic in a world that we wouldn’t get to see except through the eyes of a magizooligist.  


&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr – I think that Crimes of Grindelwald is a character-driven movie in so many ways, and that all five films (if they finish making them) will be a story where the threads are woven together into something whole like the Sorting Hat, where characters make their choices and only then become who they’re meant to be.  I thought the music was gorgeous, the beasts were beautiful, and the actors handled their roles well enough that I forgot who they were while watching. They \*were\* those characters, making real choices and feeling real feelings.

Jude Law as Dumbledore/Johnny Depp as Grindelwald

\- Dumbledore looking in the Mirror of Erised and seeing Gellert almost had me on the floor in tears

\- as much as the bromance has nothing to do with anything dammit if it doesn't make me smile

\- Newt and Tina reconnecting toward the end and her knowing he wants to say Salamandar was so adorable

\-Seeing Newt and Leta as kids reminded me of Snape and Lily so much and I assume that's very much on purpose

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Using Newt as a vehicle in this entire series - just focus on Dumbledore and cut back and forth between him and Grindelwald

\- Queenie - at least in this movie I felt really confused by her point. Is she under Grindlwald's control from the tea? Like what is even happening?

\- People are saying Ariana's obscures is inside Credence. Am I missing where an obscures is a separate being? I must be.

\-How does Credence not know something is inside him? Can you be unaware of this concept? It seems like something that should be obvious.

\- The Lestrange family - I feel like we were about to get more backstory and then it was like never mind. (Although I guess we get enough in Order of the Phoenix.)

\- I guess some of the timing confuses me but that's just me. This thread helped me clarify when Voldemort was born at least. What year was Grindelwald killed - it would be a trip if they were alive at the same time. 

\-McGonagall being in the movie is stupid. Jo can try to talk herself out of it but it doesn't maker it less stupid. 

\-Nagini I'm mixed on. I like the idea of seeing how she came to be but I'm not sure this is the vehicle for it. Its like they just want to do one prequel series instead of a few different stories like Star Wars. (I mean the standalone not the travesty that is I-III).

1182,Larsemans,1542492071,"I have a theory regarding the retcon of McGonagall's story in CoG. Specifically, I think Rowling (or someone at Warner Bros) may have chosen to change McGonagall's story for a particular reason.

One of the strongest points of the original book series was Rowling's ability to foreshadow and plan out complicated plot lines way in advance and have them all click together in the end. Because of this, I find it unlikely Rowling retconned McGonagall's story for no reason other than so Dumbledore can drop her name a couple times. I think the decision to retcon McGonagall may have been a very deliberate decision made for a very deliberate purpose.

Specifically, regarding the twist at the end of CoG, when Grindelwald tells Credence he is actually Albus Dumbledore's brother. As has been said many times before, this would not be possible in canon because both of Albus' parents died before Credence was born. Rowling knows this. She knows that we know it. But I believe that in spite of that, she still wants us to believe that there might be a chance Grindelwald is telling the truth. By retconning something relatively unimportant to the plot such as McGonagall's backstory, she shows that her making changes to the canon timeline is possible and thereby introduces the possibility that Grindelwald may not be lying. If she hadn't retconned McGonagall, the notion that Grindelwald is telling the truth would be disproven quickly due to the timeline not matching up. But by changing pre-established canon in this one case, she opens up the possibility of doing it again and thereby makes the Grindelwald-Credence mystery significantly more intriguing.

TL;DR: I think Rowling may have had meta-motives to retcon McGonagall, namely that retconning things opens up more possibilities for Credence's identity.",FantasticBeasts,[Spoilers] a theory surrounding a certain retcon,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9y0foy/spoilers_a_theory_surrounding_a_certain_retcon/,1542463271.0

1184,kpely,1542491045,"I want to preface this post by stating that ultimately I really don’t care about this that much. It is what it is and there are more important things in life to focus

People are mentioning that McGonagall shouldn’t have been at Hogwarts in 1927, but she was also there when Leta and Newt were students which would be in the 19-teens. In those flashbacks she appears to be, and this would make sense for the profession, in her mid-to-late twenties, which would place her birth around 1890. This makes her nearly 50 years older than we were led to believe from JK Rowling’s backstory of her on Pottermore. It also means she is over 100 years old when Harry goes to Hogwarts.

I understand that magical folk live longer with an average life expectancy around 115 years, but to change this detail of her doesn’t just change our perception of her age, but it does change her life experiences.

In the backstory we were given she is born in 1935 which means she would have been a little kid during World War II. But now she was actually an adult for World War I, which we hear impacted the wizarding world too.

I saw somewhere that she was a student while Dumbledore was transfiguration teacher, but clearly now that is not possible. In fact, it becomes less likely she was a student while Dumbledore was a teacher at all given how close they are in age.

This also means that when she is Headmistress during the Cursed Child she is close to 130 years old. 

Overall, this really doesn’t matter, especially to casual viewers, but to those of us who enjoy the details it makes it a little frustrating and slightly more difficult to suspend our disbelief.",FantasticBeasts,The implications of her being in the movie {SPOILERS},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9y0atd/the_implications_of_her_being_in_the_movie/,1542462245.0

Dumbledore is the son cruelly banished from the magical world because he has to abandon the taking the Grand Tour of the world with his friend Doge to take care of his sister.

Ariana has despair due to condition (outbreaks), pretty self-explanatory.

Grindlewald is the great avenger with wings from the water. Notice in COG, the water attacking all the aurors has wings. He hates muggles because muggles fucked Ariana up, and possibly his potential relationship with Dumbledore?

I’m not sure if it is true but in the next movie, it could be revealed that Grindelwald in that movie could be the true villain who started WW2. Also another theory could be that Grindelwald is Adolf Hitler. The movie took place a few years after WW1 and before WW2. In Grindelwald’s plan, his speech foreshadowed the uprising and consequences in the coming future. It was shown in his vision to have fighter jets and a nuclear explosion at the end. Grindelwald does show hatred toward muggles, just like Hitler’s hatred toward jews. Muggles you may think are people born without magic, But it’s possible it could turn out to be a religion of some type that probably doesn’t believe in the magic Grindelwald does. If that was to be the case, it would mean Grindelwald is also anti-semitic as well. My whole explaination behind this may sound like it does not make sense, but the overall theory is that Grindelwald’s plan foreshadows and probably sets up the story of the next movie. Both Grindelwald and Hitler both have anti-semitic views which could mean either Grindelwald in the Wizarding World Universe was the one who caused WW2 to happen, or may be revealed to be if not Hitler for the Fascist views both in common. If this is all true not only is it controversial, it was probably meant to take the movie a step further into a darker next installment that mixes it’s fantasy along with real world elements having to do with a real life danger in the real world.

However, I would like to focus on a fact that should make even angry and slightly-mad Credence suspicious about Grindelwald.

&amp;#x200B;

What many people seem to forget are the information we can get from the first Fantastic Beasts movie, especially before the big ""Credence is the obscurial"" reveal. Grindelwald (or Graves at that point) uses Credence to look for the obscurial and it doesn't even cross his mind it could be him, simply because he is too old. This is first dead giveaway that points to the fact that even Grindelwald probably doesn't know anything about Credence (or knows the truth, but doesn't want to say it).

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem appears straight away during the same scene - Grindelwald tells Credence he has no idea whether he is looking for a boy or a girl. And then suddenly a few months later knows even Credences real name... Of course he can say he has learnt the truth just recently, but I guess even Credence would be suspicious about it.

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly there is this little hint hidden in the name dropped at the end of the movie. We all know J.K. loves her foreshadowing and hiding meanings everywhere she can. It can be a bit far stretched, but stay with me for a while... 

Aurelius Dumbledore. Who else shares that name? Almost everyone has ever heard about Marcus Aurelius. And that's pretty much it. I'm not a big history geek, but I just remembered this little thing about Marcus Aurelius... He was one of the ""adopted emperors"". If I'm not mistaken that means he was chosen beforehand to succeed as a ruler, he wan't bound by blood to the previous emperor. So in my mind his name is basically Adopted Dumbledore :D I believe there is nothing connecting him to the Dumbledore brothers except perhaps the obsucur inside of him.

&amp;#x200B;

(I could of course continue about how Ariana's obscurus could have been attached to Credence somehow, so he would be in a way a brother to Albus and Aberforth, because part of Ariana's soul would be a part of him etc... But that has been said many times already in the past days.)

1204,rayshinsan,1542473646,"So during the movie I noticed that a lot of people were confused on this triangle. It did not help that Newt did not elaborate in FB1, but it begged the question why is Leta with Theseus and not Newt?

&amp;#x200B;

I think its understandable if you look at it from the following situations:

A. Lita is in love with Newt

This is clear, she was a troubled child with bad pasts, abandonment issues and thus seeking attention to justify her existence. He was the only one willing to see her for who she is and to accept her without judgment.  She was fascinated by his talent and felt she was safe around him and he protected her like her prince charming. His talent and interest mesmerisms her to the point that she believing to be a monster feels he is the only one who can understand her. 

&amp;#x200B;

B. Newt is an Introvert who cannot express himself properly / Asperger syndrom

Not only is he an introvert, but his interest in creatures makes him oblivious to his other interests. He loved Lita, but he could not understand that he was in love with her and was too afraid to confess. Because he has hard time with social skills, he relegates himself to be just her protector and friend, until he loses his chance. He was the nerd, she was the popular girl and confessing would be aiming to go above his pay grade. Classical tale of the nerds never get the hot cheerleader. 

&amp;#x200B;

C. Theseus is a Knight in Shinning Armor

Unlike Newt, Theseus is a brave and confident men. He saw a beautiful damsel in distress who he thought was just his brothers friend (i mean too him knowing Newt and his love for creatures it would be a impossibility that Newt would be interested in girls). He took a swing at her and was charmed by her ""bad girl"" persona. He probed and realized she was damaged and thus also decided to protect her, However, unlike Newt he went at her and expressed his romantic interest.  When the moment presented itself he professed his love for her.

&amp;#x200B;

D. Entanglement to Victory: You go for the One that profess to you 1st

Lita now had 2 protectors and one of them confessed to her. She wanted Newt but knowing Newt and his tendencies she felt he would never show her any more interest than just a friend although deep down she wanted him to confess. She wanted to accepted and have a reason to exist. So after the long wait, when Theseus confessed she decided to go for him instead of what she really wants. She made compromise that sometimes you just have to settle for the best option especially when it looks like it is the only option.

&amp;#x200B;

Went she accepted, Newt being Newt accepted it and shed his feelings aside. He didn't like his brother much but is she was happy. He was not going to be the one to interrupt. So he backed out, fully from both of their lives in hopes that they will be happy, regardless of his earlier feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the backing away, made Theseus aware that Newt was not as dense as he thought but at the same time he was a gentlemen, The girl accepted, he was not going to back away now, especially since he also loved her and willing to fight him to have her.

&amp;#x200B;

Still deep down, even if the girl got herself a knight in shinning armor, it was not the one she really wanted. She realized it more and more each time she got in touch with Newt. Her ultimate culmination of this realization was when she saw him  with Tina. You can feel she was speechless the moment she saw his interest towards Tina. But she wanted to fight one last time for his approval.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, she stood up to Grindelwald because for once she wanted to not that damsel in distress and rather he the protector. She sacrificed herself for him, hoping to repay all those years of protection he offered to  her.

&amp;#x200B;

Its an excellent love triangle, but a very tragic one because one man could not confess, one women could not accept (herself) and last man could not back down.

Some discussions later, I have upgraded my theory, clarifying some grey areas, and coming up with what I think will be revealed in the upcoming movies. Here it is:

* **Gellert Grindelwald used Percival Dumledore to conceive Aurelius, wanting to create a new powerful obscurial, wich he witnessed in Ariana, but couldn't harness due to her dying in the three way duel.**

Here's how it went down. With dates and everything:

* prior 1899 - Gellert becomes fascinated with the Deathly Hallows. He is expelled from Durmstrang for having made ""twisted experiments"", so twisted that even a school pretty tolerant of Dark Arts doesn't approve. He starts thinking about overturning the Internation Statue of Secrecy.
* 1899 (June) - Gellert arrives in Godric Hollows to research the Hallows, befriends the orphan Albus, and discovers Ariana, a powerful obscurial who managed to live past the usual life expectancy of her kin. He immediately starts planning how to harness her powers to aid his cause (""useless without the host"" - FB1).
* 1899 (July) - Gellert and Albus study the Deathly Hallows. The make a Blood Pact not to fight each other (probably Gellert persuaded Albus in doing so, worried that the latter would later reject the cause and hunt him down).
* 1899 (Late August) - Gellert tries to convince Albus to study and use Ariana's Obscurus. Albus isn't sure. Aberforth discovers Gellert plans and confronts him: a duel ensue. Albus can't fight Gellert, and tries to protect both his brother and friend. Ariana gets involved in the duel (due to her witnessing it) and gets killed (nobody knows who cast the spell that killed her). The Dumbledores lose a sister, Gellert looses an important and rare asset that he really treasured.
* 1899 (September?) - Gellert visits Gregorovitch and steals the Elder Wand.
* 1899 (October 31?) - Grindelwald, having lost Ariana, does the only thing he can to try and get a new powerful Obscurus: he breaks into Azkaban and either aid Percival Dumbledore escape or takes from him what he needs to generate a new Obscurus. He later either imperius him to conceived another son with an unknown woman, or just use his semen to impregnate her (so ""twisted"" experiments).
* 1900 (July 31, anyone?) - Aurelius Dumbledore is born.
* 1901 - Aurelius mother ends up loving his son, and wants to protect him from Grindelwald. She ran away with her child, planning to hide in USA. If Percival got out of Azkaban he may have aided her, and paid with his life.
* 1901 - Grindelwald looses Aurelius and his mother. They are aboard a ship to USA that sink. Aurelius mother dies trying to save his child. Unbeknown to her, his child was swapped with baby Corvus Lestrange by Leta (aged 5/6). Leta was bound to be the cause of his brother death via The Prediction of Tycho Dodonus. It is quite safe to say Grindelwald investigated the matter and also presumed Aurelius to be dead.
* 1905 - Aurelius Dumbledore gets adopted by MaryLou Barebone under the name of Credence Barebone. Credence was a false identity originally conceived to hide Corvus Lestrange. (Credence is stated to be born in 1904 in the certificate, but this date doesn't add up, even if Credence is Corvus. This is an open issue, if someone has some explanation, I would be eternally grateful).
* 1926 - Grindelwald hears some rumors about a possible Obscurus in New York. He knows Aurelius is dead, he goes to find the obscurial and try to do what he couldn't with Ariana. He completely overlooks Credence, because he knows Aurelius died, and maybe because Credence little sister reminds him so much of Ariana.
* 1926 - After witnessing Credence powers, Grindelwald begins to suspect his true identity, and later confirms it by using is magical hookah and/or ordering his followers to investigate on the matter.
* Sometime between 1926 and 1927 - Aurelius is tending to a bird chick (that probably appeared in front of him out of nowhere in a burst of flames). It is Fawkes, the Phoenix Guardian of the Dumbledores, passed down from father to son: an unbeatable evidence of Credence true lineage.

Find me a hole in this, I challenge you! It's amazing how it all fell togheter almost by itself when I looked at dates and facts.

Some criticism you might want to bring out:

* No one ever escaped Azkaban before Sirius Black! -&gt; &gt;!That is prooven wrong in canon, remember Barty Crouch Jr?!&lt;
* Kendra/Ariana is Aurelius mother! -&gt; &gt;!We see two children in the ship, both seemingly less then 1yr old. Even if the ship sunk Jan-1-1901 Aurelius would have been born in early 1900, and we know that Ariana and Kendra were dead by that time.!&lt;
* Credence has Ariana Obscurus inside him -&gt; &gt;!Please show me some theory to support that that isn't ""I don't want to believe Aurelius is Albus brother"". My theory is far more logical, and has to do just with character motivations, no magical technicality here!!&lt;
* So all this happend by chance? What a coincidence Leta swapped his brother for Aurelius -&gt;&gt;! What a coincidence both Harry and Neville were born in late July, by families who had three times defied Voldemort: I could go on with coincidences in original saga the we know and love!!&lt;
* Why nobody mentioned Aurelius in the original saga? -&gt;&gt;! People have their reason to keep secrets, and the Dumbledores surely have history in keeping secrets! I'm confident in the next movies: we will see how events will go down, and we will be given a valid reason on why Albus never mentioned fighting or saving his brother Aurelius. That is required for JK, or else she'll face the rage of the fandom. Remember that Albus never told about Snape to Harry. Harry would have never knew if not for Snape himself! Imagine if Rowling dropped the bomb of Snape loving Lily years after the last book: nobody would have believed her, but it would have still make sense with the canon.!&lt;

I'm waiting for your opinions... make my day!

There are also multiple similarities between Grindelwald and Adolf Hitler. Both view one particular group of people as inferior, both deceive the populus to get what they want, both have a very devoted group of almost religious adherents. Both are from Austria, both have a headquarters in the Alps, both have a 'famous prison' (or in Hitler's case a prison-system). Not to forget: For the greater good and Arbeit Macht Frei. The similarities go on and on.

Do you think that there is a link between Grindelwald and the Third Reich and how would you feel about it when it would be touched in the Fantastic Beasts series?

I personally think it is very hard to ignore the second World War when making a series of films with these themes and set in this era.

&amp;#x200B;

Cousin Credence Theory  

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that Credence is related to Albus (that sounds obvious but some disagree) however he's not a brother but rather a cousin. In the original Harry Potter books we are told of the three Dumbledore siblings; Albus born 1881, Aberforth born 1883 and Ariana born 1885, died 1899. We also know of their parents; Percival who was sent to Azkaban and died there and Kendra who died in 1899 from an explosion caused by Ariana. These factors make it unlikely Credence was a full brother of Albus due to Percival being in Azkaban meaning the timeline is about 10 years off, and for the theories about Credence being Percival's son conceived in Azkaban I highly doubt it.     

&amp;#x200B;

These are all the family we know of from the original series however in notes written by Dumbledore for ""Tales of Beetle the Bard"" (written by JKR)he mentions an aunt of his called Honoria. We know Kendra is from a family of muggles and while it's not impossible it's very unlikely for muggles to have two magical children meaning it is more reasonable that Honoria is the sister of Albus' dad, Percival. Albus also mentions she's a maiden aunt meaning she was never married, which may seem to disprove that Credence is her son, however if he was conceived out of wedlock it reassures the idea that he was shipped off to America as an infant. Because of this he would still be a Dumbledore (sharing a grandfather with Albus) meaning the whole Phoenix business still works.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the Crimes of Grindelward screenplay the ship Credence was on set sail in 1901 while his birth certificate is for 1904. This gives us a rough idea of when he was born making him either 26 or 24 in the 2nd movie (I don't have an explanation for the dates, please leave an suggestions). Albus is 46 in Crimes of Grindelward meaning there would be a roughly 20 year gap between him (the eldest) and his cousin which is reasonable as we don't know the age of Honoria. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my first ever public Harry Potter theory, please feel free to make suggestions or even dispute it I really appreciate it. I sourced my info from the books, screenplay, movies and pottermore. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Albus' paternal Aunt Honoria, is Credence's mum making him Albus' cousin. ",FantasticBeasts,Cousin Credence Theory *Spoilers*,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xvio4/cousin_credence_theory_spoilers/,1542423063.0
1224,eulerianpancake,1542450581,"I genuinely loved this movie, I completely disagree with the criticism it has gotten and I don’t think the reveal at the end scrambles up the timeline*.

HOWEVER, I can’t help being annoyed -and at times even distracted- by the fashion choices of 1927 wizards. If you’ve read the original Harry Potter books or seen the movies, you know that wizards, especially those who don’t interact with the muggle world that much, dress in old fashioned, traditional wizard robes. Albus Dumbledore specifically has not been seen wearing anything other than robes in the course of the seven books/movies. Isn’t it a bit weird that in Crimes of Grindelwald we see him being very much up to date with the latest muggle clothing trends?

Moreover, why would Grindelwald wear muggle clothes? He wants to destroy the Statute of Secrecy, so wouldn’t it make more sense to adhere to traditional wizard clothing?
Here’s a relevant excerpt from Pottermore:
“Anti-Muggles will often attempt to demonstrate their superiority by adopting a deliberately flamboyant, out-of-date or dandyish style in public.”

I feel like when making this movie they didn’t want to make it seem ~childish~ and for some reason thought that audiences would feel more alienated if the main characters were dressed in wizard robes. OR they flat out ignored/ didn’t pay attention to canon. Either way, I’m disappointed by this choice (no matter how good Jude Law looks, damn)

*Regarding the Credence being a Dumbledore reveal, I think that what it actually means is that a part of Arianna’s Obscurial somehow resides within Credence, but that’s a topic for another post.

1228,darktwin7,1542447640,"I saw the movie yesterday and read many theories here in reddit. Taking ideas from them I have tried to put one that seems most plausible. Thing we know or can safely assume:

\* Ariana Dumbledore was an obscurial.

\* Gellert Grindelwald was very much into dark twisted experiments. He was expelled from Durmstrang, a school famous for its tolerance of Dark Arts.

\* Albus Dumbledore was a brilliant wizard. He wanted to escape from his responsibilities and seek glory. He felt trapped and wasted. With Grindelwald he saw a chance of being part of a revolution. They both sought the Deathly Hallows. Of course their reasons were different. Albus turned a blind eye towards what he suspected Grindelwald was ""for the greater good"".

&amp;#x200B;

And now the guessing part based on the theories I read here.

&amp;#x200B;

Grindelwald convinces Albus to take out the obscurus out of Ariana. Aberforth interrupts them and then there is a duel. I am guessing Grindelwald leaves with the obscurus. But it is useless for him without a host. Obscurus are rare so he wouldn't give up that easily. He thinks a sibling can act as one. People are generally rejecting Aurelius being a sibling based on Percival being in Azkaban and dying there. They think Grindelwald was lying to Credence. But I believe Aurelius can be son of Percival. Why? Because a dark powerful wizard wants it to be so. Breaking out of Azkaban is not impossible. Sirius maybe the first who did it without outside help. It wouldn't be difficult for someone like Grindelwald to come up with a plan to free Percival. Bartemius Crouch did a similar thing. Yes, Percival was a man of honour but after all these years in Azkaban we don't know how resistant he would be to an Imperius curse or love potion or whatever. 

	So a son is born and he is given a proper name Aurelius. I am guessing Grindelwald tried to make the boy a host for the obscurus. But by now Percival has started to fight against whatever spell he is under. He finds out Grindelwald is after Aurelius and arranges to ship him to America with Honoria Dumbledore. Grindelwald follows them, maybe there is a duel and Percival dies. We know what happens next ship carrying Aurelius sinks. Grindelwald believes that he died.

	So years later Grindelwald foresees another obscurial in New York. Believing no obscurial could live that longer he doesn't think him to be Aurelius. But after he finds out he decides to use him against Albus Dumbledore. 

	Whatever be the backstory I think this franchise is gonna be great for the fans. There is so much to look forward to. Like the reaction of Albus when he comes to know about Aurelius. Maybe seeing the pain he is in he decides to do something he couldn't do before to save Ariana. Maybe there is a reason why Albus Dumbledore considers love as the most powerful force. Phoenix are extremely loyal and would depart to find their own paths if their owners die, rather than finding a new master. However I choose to believe that in this case Albus at least tries to do something so great for Aurelius that his phoenix which I love to think is Fawkes makes Albus his new master. What Albus sees in mirror of erised is his family. That is his deepest desire.

In Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them, **Grindelwald used human transfiguration to impersonate** non other than **Percival Graves**, not just a top official but **the head of MACUSA's Department of Magical Law Enforcement.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I have many questions about Grindelwald's use of human transfiguration, especially when everyone else is using polyjuice potion, I'll bypass those questions to focus on a bigger issue.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the previous movie, **MACUSA discovered that Grindelwald was impersonating Graves** and captures him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Crimes of Grindelwald begins **six months later** and **MACUSA's president says that they had to remove Grindelwald's tongue because he was ""very persuasive"".** Because the audience knows that Grindelwald is in fact, Abernathy, **what the president is REALLY saying is that Abernathy,** **~~not Grindelwald~~****, was very persuasive**... SO persuasive, that **MACUSA had no option but to cut his tongue**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have serious doubts about Abernathy being persuasive... I mean, we're talking about a character that literally had 3 lines in the previous movie and ZERO lines in this one... yep, that's the same character that MACUSA's president thought to be extremely persuasive. - Nonetheless, that's still not the main point of my comment. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main point is: **How is it even possible that Grindelwald was able to fool MACUSA not once but TWICE in the exact the same way?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Is JKR telling us that they didn't anticipate and prepare for this possibility at all after dealing with such aftermath in the previous movie and losing their own head of the department of magical law enforcement? 

&amp;#x200B;

I also wonder, **why on earth was Abernathy trying to be persuasive at all if the real Grindelwald was free already?.**

1237,Leahwallzorz,1542436394,"I am a diehard Potterhead. I’m part of the generation who was raised reading the books, my mom read them to me and my brother every night. They inspired me to become a writer. The Harry Potter universe is my safe haven in rough times. All of that passion comes with a level of purist snobbery, I own that. But I came into the Fantastic Beasts fully ready to embrace the series as something new, and the first movie I absolutely loved. But what I loved about it was that it lived seamlessly in the universe; it was new and yet it paid homage to the books that led to its creation.

I wanted to love this movie. I really loved several bits of it! Nagini I absolutely loved, the explanation of why she never was a human in the books because she’s trapped, beautiful and tragic. I loved the new beasts, Newt was as brilliant as he was the first time... but there was so many wrong uses of familiar spells? Since when does just Lumos create a floating ball of light that spirits away? It’s supposed to emit light from the tip of your wand. 

But that’s so knit picky, right? It is! But little bits like that seemed to come up all over. McGonagal is a certified bad ass, so why is she running after Leta LeStrange shouting out point losses like some pansy who had no respect from her students? And then the ending, where suddenly Dumbledore has a second secret brother? 

If he had another sibling who was an obscurial (probably didn’t spell that right) other than his sister, he would go to that sibling to save them - I believe that absolutely. His regret he carries all the way to his last days is that he failed his sister. If he had a sibling he could save, if he could right that wrong, he would not be chilling at hogwarts joke duelling his students having a ball just chilling while Newt does his dirty work for him.

And the phoenix who suddenly goes from baby to fully grown... that’s not how phoenixes work! They grow old, burst into flame, and become babies. Not the other way around - and so mother f*cking help me if that turns out to be Fawkes, who is the literal embodiment of loyalty to Albus Dumbledore, just hanging out with people plotting Albus’ demise. 

I guess what bothers me most about the whole secret Dumbledore brother idea is that Albus would have told Harry about Credence. The bond of respect and friendship they share in the end books, going into Dumbledore’s past and Grindelwald... he just would have told Harry, there’s no reason he wouldn’t. 

Am I being to picky? People who aren’t bothered by the ending, why aren’t you? I genuinely would love to hear, I’d love to have my mind changed on it.

1239,cbirchfield92,1542433299,"The key to Credence’s identity and his relationship to the Dumbledores is tied to obscurials.

Here's why:

1. Obscurial and Obscurus(es?) have played a major role in the plot of both movies. This is a major theme in the way that horcruxes were in the original series. There was a classic Rowling twist with the Horcruxes when we learned Potter was a Horcrux and had to die in order to defeat Voldemort. It's safe to assume she might implement a similar red herring technique with the Obscurus. 
2. The official definition of an **Obscurus** describes it as a ""[dark](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Arts)"" and ""parasitic"" force. This energy could manifest itself as a separate entity that can erupt in violent, destructive fury.[\[1\]](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Obscurus#cite_note-0)
3. In *FBAWTFT* we learn that Newt has successfully separated an Obscurus from the body of a young Sudanese witch. This is also proof that an Obcusrus can be separated from an Obscurial. We also learn that Dumbledore holds Newt in high regard. I think the two are related.
4.  The symptoms of an Obscurial sounds awfully familiar to Ariana's condition described in the Deathly Hallows. 
5. We learn in *COG* that Dumbledore lead Newt to New York - where Grindelwald was already searching for the rogue Obscurus. 
6. In *FBAWTFT* Grindelwald (as Percival) mentions to Credance that he believes he's searching for a young girl. Ariana was 14 when she died. We find out in *COG* that his obsession with this Obscurus is related to his desire to take out Dumbledore because he can't do it himself. 
7. There's obviously a deep emotional wound from Dumbledore and Grindlewald's falling out. I think that Grindlewald would want his death to be personal and cruel. 
8. In *COG,* Dumbledore says, “I know this: an Obscurus grows in the absence of love as a dark twin, an only friend. If Credence has a real brother or sister out there who can take its place, he might yet be saved.”

So with these facts out on the table, not to mention the numerous time/plot-line issues that would arise if Credence really was a new Dumbledore, tell me this doesn't make sense. 

Credence is actually possessed by Ariana's Obscurus. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald suspect this, and seek to save and use him respectively. The end of this series results in the duel between the two that somehow releases/destroys Ariana's Obscurus (dark twin) thus closing the circle. 

I know my explanation is not completely bullet proof, but it sure as hell seems like something Rowling would do. Thoughts?

1242,failuring,1542430545,"!&gt;There's a theory posted here that Credence has Ariana's obscurial, but I want to propose one better: Credence _is_ Ariana.

First, let's clarify the dates. Credence is older than he looks and people assumed. That ship went down in 1901. Ariana was killed in summer 1899. Now, there is a vague reincarnation theory there, but a) that really doesn't seem to exist in the HP universe, and b) It seems really unlikely anyone would even figure that out.

My theory is that, basically, obscurals...come apart and go back together, right? The attack that supposedly killed her didn't. It just...killed a lot of her.

She reformed as an infant...a _male_ infant. (Why she changed genders is left unanswered at this time, but there are a few possible reasons. Likewise, how Credence was later able to reform his entire body completely is unknown, but maybe it simply because he was older and seemed to have some level of control over his magic, or maybe it was just he was blown apart differently.)

Alternately, _Albus_ glued the obscural together, and had the infant be male as additional disguise. In fact, if Albus did this on purpose, this would have actually worked to cure an obscural! He figured it out! Make them a baby and try again! Except Credence got raised _again_ in a obscural-creating environment, whoops.

But, regardless if Albus did it, he knows about it. And he's the one that sent the infant away (To keep it away from Grindlewald and any association with himself) to some trusted person in New York (Surely the great Albus Dumbledore wouldn't be so silly as to hand an infant over to some stranger to have them raise...oops, nevermind.), then thought it had drowned on the ship. This is why he sent Newt to New York when he learned of the obscural running around there, realizing he might have been wrong and his sister/brother might still be alive. Because Newt literally was the only person who has any experience in trying to save obscurals.

Alberforth does not know this, and in fact never learned it. Probably because Credence is going to be dead at the end of these movies, and there's not a lot of point in Albus ever telling him.

Grindlewald didn't know either, not in FB1. But while he was locked up, he researched Credence (Who he'd ignored previously because he was way too old.) and somehow discovered that one of Albus's associates was on the ship and, let's not forget, he has some of Albus's blood _and_ has tracked down Credence somehow, so perhaps he's actually somehow done a magical DNA test.

As for where the name 'Aurelius' came from? Grindlewald didn't want to explain the whole 'Well, you apparently changed genders for some reason', so just...came up with an male-sounding a-r name.

This also neatly explains the unresolved question of how the heck we have an obscural that is so old...because no one knows what they do if you 'reset' them.!&lt;",FantasticBeasts,My theory about the reveal,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xtouw/my_theory_about_the_reveal/,1542401745.0

1248,digitaldraco,1542423416,"So I've done a bit of reading over on Reddit but I find people mostly love to stretch their imagination to explain things. There have been some good observations, though, imo.

First, while it would be an interesting twist to see how it is explained, I don't think Credence is a Dumbledore. Grindlewald said he needed a weapon, someone to attack Albus. He can't and nobody else will. What better way to turn Creedence against this person he doesn't know than to manipulate his desire for family against him? 

Not sure how the phoenix factors in, though. I must have missed how Credence came into possession of it. But I'm willing to bet that it is Fawkes and that it will end up with Albus.

I am still at a loss figuring out the story with Leta and how she got away from Barebone to go to Hogwarts and why any wizard would send their kid to live with her in the first place and how Leta just happened to pick up another magical child. Was the boat full of wizards?

And how was Creedence able to cast anything with a wand that didn't choose him with no practice at all?

Lastly, how does Yusuf's unbreakable vow resolve now? He's still alive after Leta died (TOO SOON) so LeStrange's male heir must still be alive...

I absolutely LOVED seeing the French ministry and all the new animals, though.

I hope Queenie comes back around but it's great to see her betrayal as an example of the allure  of Grindlewald's message. As opposed to Voldemort where everyone who followed him (with few exceptions) were already ""evil"" leaning.

1250,FindingMoi,1542421976,"I've seen a lot of comments discussing Queenie's questionable behavior, some suggesting her mental state was off, or she was under the Imperious curse, or something along those lines. 

I personally do not think so. I think Jk intentionally wrote Queenie this way to make some parallels and drive home a point about how a ""good guy"" could be convinced by a charismatic leader to join the wrong side. 

I believe that her intention was to humanize the average person who, in the beginning of Hitler's rise to power, would choose to join the Nazi party. 

Allow me to be clear here-- Jk has made it abundantly clear that she is not a nazi sympathizer (see: her Twitter account). However, I wouldn't put it past her to explore how a normal, otherwise good person could fall into the trap of a charismatic leader. Treading very carefully with my wording here to avoid breaking any rules about discussing current politics, I DO believe that she may have been making a current political statement here, by suggesting how easy it is to hear something you want to hear from a political candidate and following them blindly. 

I mentioned earlier about parallels, and I believe that was Jk's intention with Queenie and humanizing characters we see in a different light in the original story. The first is an easy conclusion-- Death Eaters, and how someone could end up following Voldemort without being truly ""evil."" Grindelwald/Hitler/Voldemort seem to be very intertwined in their parallel pathways. 

The second is referring to the begining of the movie, and Jacob and his enchantment. I was instantly reminded of Merope Gaunt and her use of love potion to try to force Riddle into marrying her. Both are using magic on muggles to get their loves to marry them. 

In HBP, Dumbledore says: 

""I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she convinced herself that he would have by now fallen in love with her in return....."" 

I instantly thought of that when Newt convinces Queenie to remove the enchantment and let Jacob decide for himself he wanted to marry her. Queenie is desperate to feel ""normal,"" that's why she is so bothered by being called crazy by Jacob. She gives her little speech to him, asking if it's so wrong to want normal things like marriage. 

I think this is meant to, again, humanize the characters who just want love and the means they use to get it. This is hardly the first time Jk has explored this subject-- just take a look at Snape, (parallel #3)

Snape and Queenie's stories run parallel in many ways, but opposite in others. Queenie joined the bad guys for selfish reasons on her quest to be loved. Snape joined the good guys for selfish reasons on his quest to be loved. Both joined their respective sides out of love for someone else-- queenie because she believes it will lead to acceptance of her and Jacob's love, Snape to protect Lily. They're both selfish, but Queenie is much more likable than Snape as a character.

1254,HBIC420,1542417548,"Seriously don't read this post if you haven't seen the movie, it will ruin it.

So IF Grindelwald is telling the truth and ""Credence"" is actually Aurelius Dumbledore I think he HAS to have been conceived by Percival Dumbledore from inside of Azkaban. It's not a stretch, Percival is likely to be a very powerful wizard and we all know a lot of things are possible from inside of azkaban if you think outside the box (like Sirius). Also remember how secretive the dumbledore family was and how completely unsurprised albus dumbledore was in HP that Sirius escaped and was alive. Grindelwald specifically says something like ""your brother wants to kill you"" implying Albus Dumbledore is his brother. 
Now I also think its entirely possible Grindelwald is lying, and we still don't know who credence really is. 

But Leta is definitely not lying about switching the babies and the proof is in the boggart.

The next thing that bothers people is that McGonnagal's age doesnt line up, but the HP books never say her age outright, only give a general idea, and I think JK will be able to explain that satisfactorily. Im glad she may be a part of future FB movies. 

Im also really disappointed with Queenie's character and her relationship with Jacob. I wanted to see them happy together but instead Queenie kinda drove herself crazy and made a series of bad choices. It's disappointing but I'm not bashing this decision for her character because its realistic and shows that even good, kind people fell into Grindelwalds trap, plus there's plenty of time for her character to redeem herself.

The only thing that really really bothered me was that the Magical Congress of the United States is suddenly now called American Ministry of Magic lol. That doesnt even sound remotely American and its inconsistent.

Other than that I loved this movie and I'm so excited for more.

1260,Danielorjan,1542405573,"... mainly because in the average amount of screen time that Queenie got, I still can't put my finger on what is up or down.

If you just hated what happened to her, think of it this way. There are numerous ways the upcoming movies can play out with this plotline.

Alot of theories are being crafted and to mention a few:

\- Queenie read GGs mind and saw a possible immediatie future that she could prevent or affect. So she decided that ""Keep your enemies closer"" was the best strategy at this point. Queenie could end up being a surprise hero, much like Neville was at the end of the HP books.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Queenie is under the Imperius Curse and is being used by GG to read his subordinates and Creedences mind for strategic purpose. This would imply he's been aware of Queenie being a legilimens from an early start and that he had been planning for this a while. Rowling is known for complex stories with a lot of plotlines to connect and surely this theory could add to her current story.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Queenie simply found comfort in GGs promises and decided that any future with Jacob is better than any future without Jacob, no matter the outcome. Will her personality change in the most unlikely way, all because of a forbidden love? Love and romance is a topic JK Rowling hasn't actually touched that deeply in the HP series and a topic I think a lot of fans are missing out on. I personally think the affections between Harry / Ginny &amp; Ron / Hermione are portraied as fairly shallow without major complications (Except for the impending doom of Lord Voldemort ofc).

&amp;#x200B;

\- Queenie might be suffering from more than just heartbreak. We all remember the scene where she couldn't control her legilimens and broke down from all the voices exploding inside her head. Can she completely control her mind-reading?We naturally make the assumption it's because she lost sight of Jacob and was reminded of her love for him. Let's not forget that Queenie can actually 100% trust Jacob because she can read his mind. She knows exactly what he thinks and feels and that's why she come to love him. Can you imagine how picky you would be if you could read peoples minds? Jacob is a rare diamond in a sea of bedrock. We can only imagine what losing him could do to someone like Queenie, who most of all desires a life filled with true love.

&amp;#x200B;

If Rowling is exploring Romance as a more central theme this series, I imagine she would want to layer it with plenty of layers. I read one article who theorised that this is why Rowling broke canon and introduced Minerva since both she and her mother knew a muggles love and experienced similar heartbreak. Minerva could be the force that drives Queenie back to her senses, if she has in fact been either driven mad from losing Jacob or is under the Imperius Curse.

&amp;#x200B;

1272,fermata125,1542389324,"I'm honestly surprised! With all the mixed reviews and fan impressions I've read here I was expecting to hate it, but I thought it was great. NOT excellent, but for sure not as awful as some people here are making it out to be.

The main thing I want to bring up is that it's not that hard to understand. Could things have been explained more clearly? Definitely. But with all the fuss everyone was making and all the stories I've heard about ""lifelong Potterheads not being able to understand the plot"" I was expecting to walk out scratching my head. I'm a casual HP fan and I felt that though there were only one or two confusing bits. All this ""We couldn't even summarize the plot after we've seen it!!!!"" seems to be coming from people who weren't paying attention because basically everything made sense...it was just a little muddled (a fair criticism and one I agree with). I'm especially surprised that people didn't understand the Credence/Corvus baby switch because I thought that was made pretty clear. In our group of 7, only one person felt they had a tough time understanding the movie and it was because they had last seen the first movie 2 years ago.

To be fair, I'm a fan of the first movie (more so than other people I think) so I was looking forward to this. In truth I felt that the plot was better explained in this movie than in the first one (the first movie took me a rewatch to fully understand the Obscurus thing, but I don't feel like anything in this movie confused me that much). 

Obviously there were things I didn't think worked (SPOILERS AHEAD):

* I think we were given a very poor explanation for Queenie to join Grindelwald (this is the most frustrating thing)
* I thought there were some abrupt scenes and it wasn't always clear which city we were in between London, Paris, New York
* I wish Nagini had been given more to do (less mad about this because she'll obviously be in the sequels)
* Not enough Dumbledore (Jude Law was great)
* Some timeline discrepancies (McGonagall, Credence being a Dumbledore, etc) but I suspect some of these will be explained away in future movies
* The final battle with Grindelwald was great, UNTIL there was the giant blue-flame-dragon thing which they had to contain. I felt that was overkill and the battle should have ended in the crypt with Grindelwald there.
* I got a sense that this is a ""place-setting"" movie to prepare for future installments, hence all the many plots, but again I think if you're an astute viewer this won't really confuse you at all.

Now for the things I think REALLY worked:

* Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Hell yes. Whatever doubts people had should be erased by this movie, he was absolutely fantastic and stole the show I think.
* The score by James Newton Howard was beautiful
* Newt as a character remains really endearing and likable in a shy, awkward sort of way. His love subplot with Tina was lovely.
* Flashbacks to Hogwarts and Newt/Leta's childhood was very poignant and beautifully done.
* It was also awesome to be back in Hogwarts present-day.
* Really fantastic visual effects
* Jude Law (again)
* It retains a lot of the heart and humor of the original. Granted, not as much humor as the first one, but Jacob, the Niffler(s), and a few other characters provide some comic relief in a genuine, heartfelt way.

Things that I think everyone is nitpicking:

* The plot being difficult to understand (just watch the movie and pay attention, people)
* Nagini (yes we needed more, but we will obviously see her in the sequels. She needed to be introduced at some point)
* Credence reveal and other timeline discrepancies. Perhaps mistakes, perhaps will be explained away
* ""It's not as good as Harry Potter!!!"" Of course not, these movies didn't have a book series with already-developed and lovable characters to be excited about. As far as original movie stories go, I've been happy with all of the characters so far.

TL;DR: Movie isn't that confusing. It's not perfect and was probably not as good as the first one, but I felt it was a worthy sequel to the first and appears to be setting the stage for what will probably be a really exciting next chapter in the story.

Can Credence's new identity be canon? Named Aurelius Dumbledore and is the supposed brother the Albus, Aberforth, and Ariana Dumbledore. Could Credence be the older brother of Albus, and not a speculated younger brother?  We all like to ignore The Cursed Child, but that play/book relied heavily on time travel. Aurelius could have been time transposed as a baby, and a secret Dumbledore never uncovered. Or with the introduction of Nicolas Flamel, an alchemist in Paris, could he know of a potion to reverse age? Credence is an obscurus, and it is unheard of for obscurus to age past 11-12.  Had Aurelius already lived a short life then been reversed to a baby?  He would still have had to be time transposed to explain why Dumbledore may not know about him.

My two pennies: 
Leta was in love with Newt, but she considers herself a monster. She loved him so much that she did not want to corrupt the beautiful person Newt is. To stay close to him, accepted his brother.

I believe her last words were to Newt.

1281,chillhelm,1542378635,"So *the* line by Grindlewald is, I think, pretty widely accepted to be a lie. Albus is not a biological brother of Credence, the timing makes this impossible. AD's mother Kendra was dead for 7 years when Credence was born and his father Percival had been in Azkaban for at least 14 (if he hadn't died already). And we know he died there, because he didn't escape (Sirius Black was the first one to ever do that in HP3), and if it sentence had been commuted, it would have been mentioned by someone in HP7 or in one of his biographies. So unless the Dementors allowed two prisoners to fall in love and have sex in Azkaban (which seems not like a very Dementor thing to do), there is no way that Percival could have fathered a child after sitting in Azkaban for over 10 years.

Moreover, if Credences ""real"" name was Aurelius (i.e. he had actually been given a Dumbledore name at birth), GG would have known the age and sex of the child in FB1, so GG would have never gotten confused which of the two children (Chastity or Credence) was the obscurial he was looking for. Further evidence is how GG says ""I give you the name that is your birthright: Aurelius Dumbledore"", not ""the name you were born with"" or something similar, he is actually giving him a new name in that scene.

So how is Credence related to the Dumbledores? Through Ariana, or rather: Ariana's Obscurius. The Obscurius that was created by Ariana's suppression of her magic (due to the associated trauma) is the same one that later attached itself to Credence. But as I pointed out above, there is 7 years between the birth of Credence and Arianas death, how could an Obscurius live that long without a host? After all in FB1 we learn that Obscurii can't live long without a host...

My theory is this: AD and GG researched terrible things during their summer together in 1899. And there is one very prominent thing that matches a lot of the symptoms we have seen and matches a lot of ""throwaway"" lines by GG. The most terrible thing that we know of in the world of Harry Potter is the creation of Horcruxes. But as a topic of research it would make perfect sense for AD and GG: They were looking into means of immortality (The Deathly Hallows), were willing to do terrible things for ""The Greater Good"" and (at least in the case of Albus) had someone close that was immediately threatened by a terrible death (Ariana Dumbledore).  So they decided to create a Horcrux for her. They prepare everything but get interrupted by Aberforth, who mistakes the situation and thinks they want to sacrifice Ariana to create a Horcrux for one of them. A fight breaks out and Dumbledore (by accident of course), slays Ariana. This completes the Horcrux ritual and a Horcrux of Dumbledore is created. The Horcrux attaches to the closest thing around that isn't a full blown wizzard flinging spells left and right: Ariana's freshly released Obscurius. The fight ends in shock, Grindlewald leaves, Dumbledore goes to Hogwarts to teach and Aberforth moves to Hogsmead to cuddle goats.

We actually know that accidental creation of Horcruxes is possible (Mister Potter is a prominent example) and that the wizzard that created the Horcrux is not necessarily aware of it (as was the case with Voldemort not realising that Harry is a Horcrux). We know that both living and inanimate things can be Horcruxes (Nagini and Harry are living Horcruxes, 4 are inanimate objects and the diary is a weird intermediate thing).

The Obscurius is being kept alive by the piece of Dumbledore's soul, attached to it and can now roam the earth to find other victims, eventually settling on Credence (why it chooses him, I don't know, but it probably comes down to something connected with the LeStranges).

GG eventually figures out what happened: His erstwhile lover and now greatest adversary has an accidental Horcrux running around in the world somewhere. If it wasn't for the Horcrux, he could probably defeat Dumbledore in a straight up duel: He has the Blood-Oath-Thingy-Majigg and could find out to how to destroy it at an opportune time to allow him to assault Albus directly and he has the Elder Wand, so is virtually undefeatable in a magical duel. Except that Dumbledore can't be slain, while his Horcrux is around. He finds the Horcrux and settles on a plan to set Albus and the carrier of the Horcrux against eachother. If Albus kills his Horcrux, he can step in and fight and kill a weakened (and now mortal) Dumbledore. If the Horcrux kills Dumbledore, he has made him a loyal follower already. Can you say two birds one stone?

GG even tells us, that nobody could kill Dumbledore, except for Credence (just like Voldemort couldn't be defeated by anyone but his last Horcrux: Harry Potter): ""Credence is the only **entity** that can kill Albus Dumbledore.""

It also explains Credence' connection to Phoenixes (similar to Harry knowing Parselmouth).

Lastly, it explains how Dumbledore could (70 years later) diagnose the Voldemort/Potter situation so quickly and precisely: The exact same thing had happened to him (although inadvertently).




**TL/DR:** Dumbledore accidentally created a Horcrux in the form of his sister Ariana's Obscurius, which now resides in Credence Barebone. Grindlewald needs Credence to kill Albus of his own will, or else the Horcrux would keep Dumbledore alive.",FantasticBeasts,The terrible Secret of Albus Dumbledore [Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xmn0j/the_terrible_secret_of_albus_dumbledore_spoilers/,1542349835.0
1282,HeThatShallBeNamed,1542377993,"I do believe the Lestrange kid is really dead and it isn't Credence, I don't think Credence is Albus brother, but that doesn't necesserely means that Grindelwald is lying, at least not completely. I do believe, Credence/Aurelius is a Dumbledore. But i dont believe Grindelwald knew it from the begining and/or the whole story of how he got lost. Just like in the first fantastic beasts, where he afawk didnt know credence was the obscurial. So I think Grindelwald believes Credence to be Albus brother, because of the phoenix, he would know that ""myth"" because of his thing with Albus. And just realized it. BUT ... i cant actually explain how he would know the name "" Aurelius "" and not know they aren't brothers, that being said either he is lying on that part alone, or truth be told, its bullshit to end a movie with a reveal like that to turn out to be a lie, crash grab and nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

As many people stated before, Credence being Albus brother will need a big retcon in the history of the Dumbledore familly or the Azkaban . Since NO ONE LEAVED AZKABAN and there is no way Albus father could have sex in Azkaban, get someone in there pregnant and that woman was able to escape... rubish, so either we are all wrong about Dumbledore's familly and not him, not Alberforth, not any historian or other member of the familly care to include Aurelius in any familly tree, or even care for his existence, and just forgot about this huge part of history or it will turn out to be a plot hole. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically i really hope Aurelius isn't a lost brother to the dumbledores, but a cousin or something, and Grindelwald just missed that part, cause even he is wrong sometimes, so he just assumed they were brothers. And as i said anything other than that would be rubbish to me, unless it is REALLY WELL EXPLAINED and DOESN'T need retcons or make plot holes, and he being a Lestrange/not being a dumbledore would make the ending a crash grab, and i will start hating J K rowling for ever if thats the kind of person she is. As far as the other theory around of him being Ariana's son, i dont think so, mainly because she was just 14 when she died, and JK was criticized for ""praising teenage pregnancy""(or something like that) with Tonks, even though Tonks wasn't a teenager when she got pregnant ( people are stupid, we all know that) so i dont think she would make an actual teenager pregnant, but i admit, that the rape theory, it kinda of makes sense.

CAUTION!!! !!!!! Contains \[SPOILERS\] !!!!!

So I've been thinking since two days about that ending. I think the following happend (sorry for my English, it's not my first language)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald were      lovers. They both seeked for much power. Grindelwald even seduced Albus to      go darker in terms of use of magic, and Albus agreed. Grindelwald seeked      for much power and heard about Obscurial. He found out, that Ariana      Dumbledore had one inside her, because of the pain she suffered from that      abuse from the Muggles.
2. Gellert Grindelwald wanted that Obscurial and      convinced Albus to get it out of Ariana (like Newt did with the Sudanese      girl). Albus agreed, because he wanted to help his sister. They succeeded      by taking the Obscurial out, but didn't know how to isolate it, like Newt      did, or give it to a new host.
3. Aberforth found out about that and was angry. The      fight started, we all know about. Things got terribly wrong. Ariana died      in that fight. Nobody knows who spelled the curse, that killed her.      Grindelwald went away, because he thought the Obscurial was gone; he      didn't get what he wanted and doesn't care anymore about the Dumbledores.
4. But then it gets fuzzy... I think we will hear      something horrible about Albus Dumbledore. Something that will really      shock us. I’m seeing something, that he is the only one, that knows, that      the Obscurial is still alive – the only thing that’s still alive of his      sister. Maybe he’s working with his friend Nicolas Flamel, that’s why Albus      is in France. Maybe Albus is so desperate, that he’s even working with the      LeStrange family to try to put the Obscurial into a new host, a new kid –      Corvus. They manage to put the Obscurial into Corvus, but it didn’t work      so well, that’s why the kid is screaming all the time. Corvus Senior wants      to get Corvus Jr into a safe place because of that raping thing and Yusuf      who wants to kill Corvus Jr. – New York. Then the ship scene – I highly      doubt that Leta really switched the kids. Why is the light flickering? We      didn’t really saw the switching, did we? Maybe the little woman bewitched      the kid, so it stopped screaming. But Leta didn’t switched the kids and      she’s not responsible for the death of her brother – he didn’t die. Then      we have some years, where Leta is in USA – later she comes back, to go to      Hogwarts and she still thinks, she is a monster for letting her brother      die. Everybody thinks Corvus and therefore the Obscurial is dead. But he      is not. 
5. Years later Grindelwald has a vision, where he      sees, that Dumbledore attached the Obscurial to a new kid and he sees a      french castle (probably LeStrange house?), that’s why we see him in front      of a french castle at the beginning of FBAWTFT.
6. But in France he realizes, that the kid is gone.      To New York. In NY he finds Credence. And he has Arianas Obscurial inside      him, and it growed much stronger inside Credence, than ever imagined,      because of the bad things, that happend to Credence from that Second      Selmers woman. 
7. Dumbledore hears from Newt about Credence and      boooom… the Obscurial of his sister is still alive inside that kid.
8. In the end Grindelwald says, ""your brother      wants to kill you"" and calls him ""Aurelius Dumbledore"".      Maybe Aurelius Dumbledore is just the name Grindelwald gave him, because      it's Ariana Dumbledores Obscurial, but he needs a male name. Not sure      about the name yet... we will see. But it's correct, that Albus is her      brother. So Grindelwald is talking to the Obscurial in that moment. 
9. Credence gets the Phoenix because he has the      Obscurial from a Dumbledore inside him. Like Harry could speak to snakes,      because a part of Voldemorts soul was inside him (horcrux). 
10. Grindelwald thinks (and is probably right) he has      the perfect weapon now: A person with a powerful Obscurial and the      abilities of the Dumbledore family. And he has the blood pact with Albus,      so Dumbledore can't harm him. But it seems he didn't realized in the end      of the movie, that the Niffler got the amulet with the blood (Newt gave it      Albus). So that's their biggest hope now. To destroy the amulet (like      destroying a horcrux) and then get Credence and kill the Obscurial. Then      to get the Elderwand not to be attached to Grindelwald anymore, and then      ""it's just him"". Few... three movies to go. 

   
 

What I don't get: 

· What did Grindelwald do with the Obscurial he got from Newt? He asked Newt ""It's useless without the host?"" - so he doesn't know how to get it into a new body, right? But what did he do with it? It's not mentioned in Crimes of Grindelwald.

· Something about the LeStrange family and the connection to Dumbledore. I don’t see any reason yet, why we learn and see so much about the LeStrange family yet… Because Leta is dead, and Credence seems not to be a LeStrange? I doubt that last fact. I think he is a LeStrange with the Obscurial of Ariana.

Now this is all speculation, and everybody can have their theories until we figure out the concrete answer. People are saying Ariana was pregnant, but this is absurd because she would have been around 13 or just turning 14 by the time she would conceive credence even if the chance of that being the case was plausible. Either way it would be Dumbledores nephew. With that being said, if this were true did NOBODY tell Aberforth or Albus at all despite their fame? Not buying it. Others are saying that that Percivil Dumbledore had a child in Azkaban and then credence somehow ended up on a sinking ship. If this were the case, credence would be 37 years old in CoG. That theory doesn't even matter because credence was born in either 1907 or 1908. If either of these theories are true, I think grindelwald is lying to Credence about his family and his actual relation to Albus (he could potentially be a cousin of some sort), or Grindelwald is a dirty manipulative liar and lies to Credence so he feels like he has a name to live up to.

The next ones should stay in the UK because the main characters are all from there, and we hardly got to see the French magical world (besides the ministry of magic). Would love to hear your thoughts/theories!

&amp;#x200B;

Some thoughts on the next installments:

How do you think they will incorporate WWII in? 

I am assuming the last film will entirely take place in 1945, so the next 2 movies have almost 20 years to fill.

Do you think there will be any mention of Voldemort? I sure hope so, but not enough to make people think there will be more movies about him. ",FantasticBeasts,Next 3 Fantastic Beast Movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xj4oa/next_3_fantastic_beast_movies/,1542316030.0

He also acted like the obscurus had feelings, like it was the little girl that died from it.. what if when Ariana died her obscurus had to find another host and it found baby credence.

I giggled a few times but that was it. I didn't feel anything close to emotional. Queenie and Jacob were off. The bromance between Newt and Jacob was gone. I didn't feel any attachment to anyone. And man, did Nagini ever get the short end of the stick! How did we get introduced to who is to become the right hand of the Dark Lord and not even get to hear her utter more than 5 words?! 

As for the Creedence reveal, I just can't. I don't buy that Percival had a child in soul sucking Azkaban where any positive feelings are sucked out of a person. Something tells me that impotence is just a standard side effect of a dementor. Also, how is it that Creedence just happened to end up with Marylou Barebone, the same exact place Leta and the (maid/house elf?) were taking the swapped out Corvus? Are we supposed to act like it's totally believable that Albus' long lost brother and Leta's maybe dead half brother both were headed to America from England to the same exact place?! 

I am just really disappointed because I have never had anything but amazing experiences with the Wizarding World. From reading the books, to the films, to the first Fantastic Beasts film to Universal Studios... it's all been magic until now... and now it feels lost.

I think that once again, we aren't counting Aberforth in this whole Credence/Aurelius Dumbledore discussion. I wonder if Credence/Aurelius is actually Aberforth's son. The name Aurelius sounds like something from the Black family tree and given how snooty the Blacks were, the family would be highly upset with any family member being involved with Aberforth due to his dad's imprisonment, rumors about Ariana and Aberforth's dealings with goats. To escape being shunned or worse by her family, it makes perfect sense for Aurelius' mom to flee to America with her baby. 

Grindelwald is not above manipulation and he knows that if Credence finds a parent, the resulting love could destroy the obscurious so instead of telling him that he's Albus' nephew, Grindelwald leads Credence to believe Albus is his brother. That way, if Credence asks anyone about Albus' parents (whom he now thinks are his parents) he will be told they are both dead.  

The movie also stated that when in need a phoenix could come to any Dumbledore. Credence / Aurelius is definitely in need - he just doesn't realize yet that he needs to get away from Grindelwald.

1334,Bemorte,1542304244,"Hearing a lot of talk about the reveal at the very end of the movie not making sense. This is odd to me as this reveal makes the first movie make a lot more sense. Here is why:

1. Grindlewald going to America after an obscurial makes more sense after this movie. How did GG know to go and look for the obscurial in the first place. Well, I think he must have found out that the Kendra Dumbledore died on the ship to America, all from the Lestrange servant. Newt was sent to America to find Credence, and Grindlewald was there too. I think Dumbledore knew who Credence is, or at least suspected him to be the child of the prophecy.

2. So Grindlewald goes to America to find the child, only to discover that an obscurial is on the loose in New York. Think about this: he knew Ariana was an obscurial. He was there when she died. He wasn’t after the obscurial power altogether, he was after a weapon against Dumbledore. He deduces that Credence is related to Dumbledore. 

3. In TCOG, he purposefully leads Credence to the Lestrange servant, and then has her killed before she can tell him more. This drives Credence to him.

4. He verifies his belief that Credence isn’t the child of the prophecy, isn’t a Lestrange at all, from the records from the French Ministry of Magic. He places this record for Leta and co to find. Again, driving Credence to Grindelwald. 

5. I believe the Phoenix we see at the end of this movie is Fawkes. I believe Credence is  Aurelius, and Grindlewald is not lying to him when he tells him this.

6. Why would Kendra hide their brother from Aberforth and Albus? Because it’s Credence is their half brother, the result of Kendra’s relationship with someone besides her husband—who was in Azkaban at the time.

7. Lastly: why doesn’t Dumbledore tell anyone about Credence in the HP books? Well, Dumbledore is infamously secretive. I doubt Aberforth even knows. I mean, Albus doesn’t need another black eye from his brother.

I realize some people hated this movie. But damn if this isn’t the pinnacle JK of plot lines and Dumbledore drama. I realize the movie has issues, but the story is engrossing and doesn’t try to hold your hand at all. If they canceled FB series tomorrow, I’d be fine with it as long as JK finished the story in book form. If FBCOG was a book, I’d bet it’d be one of her better stories.

1336,luke-wise,1542298059,"Did anyone realise the significant presence of House Elves in Crimes of Grindlewald?

We see them cleaning the Ministry, the Lestrange's elf^(N1) and also seemingly an extended scene of 1 house elf of the Paris Circus cleaning up. It was unnecessarily long and I believe this is just Rowling rubbing the hint in our face.

What hint? Something she has long said and referenced : House Elves have incredible powers.

We know that Rapist Lestrange loved his child, Corvus Lestrange. Unfortunately, he knows that the child is in danger (due to his past misdeeds) and has to send him away. Would it really be unlikely for Rapist Lestrange to give his house-elf such an order, ""You are to bring Corvus **safely** to America"".  


We learnt in Deathly Hallows,  “The house-elf’s highest law is his Master’s bidding”  . This allows them to do seemingly impossible things, such as apparating when magic has been placed to disallow it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the Leta's flashback, we saw her **attempt** to swap the baby. At the very moment she wanted to do so, the lights flickered. We **did not** see the swap. I believe, the lady-elf, sensing danger to Corvus, did the following :  
1) Turn off the lights (to trick Leta)  
2) Swap the baby and the clothes  
3) Silenced the crying Corvus and made innocent baby cry

Leta, not knowing what the lady-elf did, assumed to the day she died, that the swap did take place.

&amp;#x200B;

This perfectly explains why lady-elf HAD to die. She knows the truth. She knows that Creedance is Corvus, and cannot be allowed to tell Creedance that. She needed to be silenced.  


But hey, Leta showed her family tree and it explicitly showed Corvus is dead right? BUT we also saw Grindlewald and Abernathy touch that family tree book in the Lestrange tomb. What if they manipulated / confounded the family tree? We know this could be done by a dark wizard (Barty Crouch Jr and the Goblet of Fire).  


Now the icing. There was a reason why the Nifler had to be the one stealing the Blood-Pact. There was a double meaning to it.  


The first purpose : To show the eerie similarity between Grindlewald and Voldermort.  
The second purpose : To tell the audience, hey, dont forget the power of the house-elf.  


I end this theory with the following quote :  


""That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children's tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. *Nothing*. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic is a truth he has never grasped."" - Dumbledore, HP and the Deathly Hallows.

1344,Clara-Alm,1542287375,"Let’s remember the events of FBAWTFT and try to tie them to this final plot twist, “Aurelius Dumbledore”:

- Evidence 1: In the first movie, Grindelwald (or Graves) was looking for a “child”. He didn’t even know the child’s age or gender. Let’s remember, he even believed the Obscurial was “Credence’s sister”, the little blond girl, Modesty. How could he have believed, even one second, that Modesty could be Aurelius? Aurelius is a male name and Modesty, a girl, is ten years younger than Credence. 

- Evidence 2 : He had Credence under his nose, knew he was a wizard with unknown parents. Yet he didn’t do the math and told himself “Oh maybe this boy is Aurelius Dumbledore?”

- No because, the only thing that mattered to him was the Obscurus (the dark parasite), not the Obscurial (the carrier of it). It didn’t matter if the Obscurus was a girl, a boy, a child or a teenager. To make short, at this point, the identity of the Obscurial didn’t matter. 

- Conclusion : he wasn’t looking for Aurelius Dumbledore but for an Obscurus in the first movie. 

So two options now :

- Between the two movies , Grindelwald learned the “true identity” of Credence which is very convenient and convoluted. (Waw the Obscurus I was looking for is also Albus brother! What a coincidence!).

- Second option, he was lying to Credence during the last scene. 

- In fact, we can be sure that Grindelwald was partially lying since he said “your own brother wants to destroy you”. We know Dumbledore doesn’t want to destroy him and he is the one who told Newt that Credence is Leta’s brother. So Dumbledore doesn’t even know that Credence is “his brother”. 

- Was Grindelwald lying about the rest? Probably. 

- It’s not the first time, he lies to Credence, playing on his deepest desire. Remember? In FB1, he was an abused boy who was looking for love. Then Grindelwald was like “You are special” “You are going to be a wizard” “You matters” acting all touchy touchy because he needed someone to find the “child”. Then, Grindelwald thought he achieved his goal, left Credence behind and told him he didn’t know who his parents were, he was nothing special and was probably a Squib. All his promises were lie. 

- It’s the same pattern here. What is Credence’s greatest desire during the movie? Finding his family. How convenient for Grindelwald to suddenly be like “I know how you parents are and Albus Dumbledore, your brother, wants to kill you.” Grindelwald needs a weapon against Dumbledore and an Obscurial is the perfect one (probably because of Ariana). Credence is foolish and angry right now, no wizards in their right mind would attack Dumbledore but since he isn’t really part of the magic community, he doesn’t fear him, so he is going to do it. 

- Proof : Grindelwald told his partisans when they asked him why Credence mattered so much. “If I ask you to go to Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore, would you do it?” No they wouldn’t because they aren’t suicidal. 

- I’m sure if Modesty was revealed to be the Obscurial in the first movie then Grindelwald would have been “Modesty, your true name is Adela Dumbledore and your brother wants to kill you”.

Random thought: 

- There is like 25 years between Dumbledore and Credence, was Kendra still fertile to give birth to another son? 

- It’s canon that Percival went to Azkaban in 1891. I don’t know if it’s possible to conceive a child in Azkaban because Credence doesn’t look to be 36 years old. 

- What about the Phoenix then? Grindelwald catch or buy a Phoenix. Maybe the Phoenix was with him all along and stolen from the Dumbledore during his youth. He waits for the Phoenix to die and resurrect as a chick. He knows where Credence was living in Paris, so he put the Phoenix under his window at night and voilà, the trick is done.

1346,thejunglebook8,1542281249,"CRAZY THEORY: What if Aurelius/Credence/Corvis/whoever the fuck he is, was created by Nicholas Flamel. He’s clearly incredibly powerful and an alchemist (allusion to Aurelius which means gold) - plus we know JK Rowling infuses meaning into her characters’ names. He also created the Philosopher’s Stone which has the power to ‘restore life’ so would he have the power to maybe create a life too? Say in theory Dumbledore and Flamel wanted to create a wizard who could take down Grindelwald should he get too powerful they could have used some of Dumbledore’s DNA - so he would have powerful blood and it explains the Phoenix. Plus I saw someone on here saying maybe Dumbledore or Grindelwald captured the Obscurial from Ariana when she died - so if we entertain that theory and say Dumbledore somehow took it and passed it on to Credence (maybe even accidentally). 

We also know that as loveable as Dumbledore is, he is a very complex multi-faceted character who is prepared to go to extremes to defeat dark magic - ie raising Harry knowing he would get killed and also AD was involved in the killing of Ariana so we know he is far from perfect.

This is admittedly hugely unlikely, but it’s a theory that would explain everything (I think) and explains why Nicolas Flamel has been introduced into the storyline. 

Further, he knows that he can’t fight Grindelwald because of the blood pact, which is a dilemma because he’s the only one who was powerful enough to. Him and Flamel together could’ve thought that they could’ve created a wizard so great that they could control the obscurion.

1349,MarshallDevil,1542275747,"## Hi everyone, at this point I’ve attended three early screenings of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald and I’m ready to give you an in-depth review of the film - WARNING: Spoilers ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY:**

&amp;#x200B;

With Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, J.K. Rowling tries to introduce multiple plots, characters, and twists that feel rushed, unimportant, and extremely confusing for the average moviegoer. It is almost impossible to pin what the movie is actually about and the audience will be forced to watch upcoming installments in order to find out if the events of this movie, in particular, are actually important for the overall arc of the saga.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite bringing us back to a wizarding world that most of us missed dearly; Yates' excessively dark style somewhat prevented the movie from being whimsical despite featuring some of the most beautiful displays of magic we've seen in the Harry Potter universe.

&amp;#x200B;

**YOU** (don’t) **KNOW WHO:**

&amp;#x200B;

One of the greatest flaws with this movie is the consequence of poor decision-making by both JKR and the marketing team at Warner Bros. Both the name ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" and the slogan ""Who will change the future?"" were terrible choices.

&amp;#x200B;

None of the fantastic beasts have a critically important role to play in the movie, the plot has absolutely nothing to do with any crimes, and nobody actually changes the future... or at least nobody does anything in particular that marks a before and after in the story.

&amp;#x200B;

As far a Grindelwald, unless you're a Potterhead like me, it's likely that you wouldn't even know who the hell Grindelwald is. The character has a bigger presence in the books than in the films, (especially in deadly hallows) but still, the character it little known, has been portrayed by three different actors, they don't even look alike, and have had less than 3 minutes of screen time before this movie.

&amp;#x200B;

To make things worst, the character was disguised as someone else in the first Fantastic Beasts, and they added a white eye that doesn't match the scene that we've already seen between him and Voldemort in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of all these reasons, it will be extremely hard for general audiences to make the connection between this movie and the wizarding world. I personally suggest they run an emergency campaign with a more explicit slogan, something like ""Before Voldemort, there was Grindelwald"" (the name wouldn't still reflect what the movie is about but at least it would attract people who might be interested in watching another Potter film)

&amp;#x200B;

**THE PLOT:**

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, I've seen the movie three times but still don't know what exactly is the movie about or why is it important as a standalone piece.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people argue that the movie is about Credence trying to find who he is... and yes, there's a little bit of that but we really don't care about him enough for that to keep us interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people argue that the movie is about a prophecy that is supposed to be about Leta Lestrange and her siblings, but towards the end of the movie it turns out that the prophecy is actually irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people argue that the movie is about not one, not two, not three, but four love stories happening at the same time, which again, it's way too ambitious for the amount of screen time.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people argue that the movie is about Grindelwald and Dumbledore, but it certainly isn't. Neither character has much screen time, they don't interact, and Dumbledore, THE GREAT, literally casts TWO spells during the entire movie, none of them powerful or important for the plot. (one of them during his Defense Against The Dark Arts class, and another is a floating glove that makes no practical sense but looks cool)

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that nothing moves forward... the movie begins with Grindelwald at large and a bunch of people from multiples countries trying to catch him and ends with Grindelwald at large and a bunch of people from multiple countries trying to catch him.

&amp;#x200B;

JKR is an amazing novelist, but she could definitely use some help from a team of seasoned screenwriters.

&amp;#x200B;

**ACTING AND CHARACTERS:**

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned earlier, none of the characters are developed enough for us to care about them; that said, this movie features a phenomenal cast and the entire cast delivers wonderful performances... in particular, Depp, Redmayne, Fogler, and Law steal the show.

&amp;#x200B;

There's an unnecessary appearance by Professor McGonagall and Nicolas Flamel... it felt too much like a crowd-pleaser and it only sparked a debate on whether or not it makes sense for McGonagall to even be an adult already working at Hogwarts as a professor by the specific time of these events.

&amp;#x200B;

Revealing Nagini in the trailers was a HUGE mistake… it killed one of the most important reveals of the movie and created an expectation around a character that barely talks during the film.

&amp;#x200B;

**50 SHADES OF YATES**

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely have mixed feelings about the artistic direction of this film... on one hand, this is perhaps one of the most beautiful installments in the entire franchise. It featured the strongest opening sequence so far, and it features a handful of visually stunning moments, settings, and creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that magic seems inconsequential and overlooked. For instance, there's a French version of Diagon Alley and we see it twice, once at nighttime and once at daytime. During nighttime, there's a scene with a circus that features a gorgeous display of acts, colors, light, and a display of amazing graphics that's consistent with the Wizarding World brand. During daylight, there's simply NO MAGIC... other than Newt casting spells, there's nothing magical happening in the stores, in the streets, no oddities, no moving posters, nothing flies, there's no array of magical beings... there's even a scene in a Cafe where nothing operates by magic... there's literally a waiter... a regular human waiter carrying stuff around.

&amp;#x200B;

Because there's a structural problem with the plot of this movie, I'll give Yates a pass for this one, but I'm not entirely sure what's his fault, what's JKR's fault, and what's the editor's fault.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE HARRY POTTER THEME SONG**

&amp;#x200B;

If you could choose ONE... just ONE instrument that could represent the entire wizarding world, that would be the celesta. John Williams' soundtrack for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the greatest masterpieces in film music history. It gave the franchise its musical identity, landed one of its first Academy Awards nominations, and ensure the Hollywood Bowl would sell out Harry Potter concerts for almost two decades after the release of the first film.

&amp;#x200B;

The role of ANY composer who came after Williams was supposed to be simple: TO PROTECT THE FUCKING FRANCHISE so the wizarding world could join Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and the rest of the sagas that understood the importance of artistic consistency for the sake of preserving its place in history.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, WB derailed from this and allowed new composers to change the tone in the same way that directors did. However, the Fantastic Beasts movies walk further away from the signature sound than any of its predecessors. TCOG doesn't use the celesta as its signature instrument anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedwig's theme is one of the most whimsical and awe-inspiring pieces of music in the entire franchise... it was first used to introduce us to a magical world from the point of view of a young boy who was impressed by everything he saw...

&amp;#x200B;

To make things worse,The Crimes of Grindelwald reuses the theme as we're taken back to Hogwarts, the problem is that we're back to Hogwarts because a commission from the Ministry of Magic is coming to aggressively interrogate Dumbledore so the scene is anything but whimsical and awe-inspiring... making the music selection seem stupid and cheap, to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

I love JNH but he missed the mark by much.

&amp;#x200B;

**IS NEWT EVEN IN THIS MOVIE?**

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, he is supposed to be the main character

&amp;#x200B;

**DOES HE DO ANYTHING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN THE MOVIE?**

&amp;#x200B;

Nope

&amp;#x200B;

**THEN WHY IS THE STORY TOLD FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW?**

&amp;#x200B;

Great question, Next!

&amp;#x200B;

**IS IT TRUE THAT QUEENIE JOINS GRINDELWALD?**

&amp;#x200B;

Yep.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT??? WHY???**

&amp;#x200B;

My only explanation is that the movie wants you to believe that Queenie is blond and stupid so she makes absolutely out-of-character choices in order to fulfill that stereotype.

In theory, Queenie buys that Grindelwald wants for wizards and witches to be free, which in theory also means that she would be free to marry Jacob legally (which is legally forbidden in the US by the time of these events) but again, because none of the characters have a chance to truly develop, this decision is plainly absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

**IS IT TRUE THAT LETA DIES?**

&amp;#x200B;

Yep

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW?**

&amp;#x200B;

Well, she basically commits suicide, in theory, to save Newt and his brother but honestly, it seemed absolutely unnecessary and unjustified. Besides that... we were just introduced to the character and again, none of the characters are well developed so nobody cares if Leta dies or lives because absolutely nothing is at stake.

If JKR wanted us to treat her like a hero, she should have kill her two movies from now so at least we could get to know her more beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHO IS CREDENCE?**

&amp;#x200B;

He’s a Dumbledore… in theory he’s Albus’ brother, but don’t even worry about that at all… it’s completely inconsequential for this movie so don’t think that it’s the kind of reveal that explains everything that happened to that point… it explains NOTHING at all.

Her character felt most different to me. All other characters from the first movie seemed to act the same. 

1) Why would she enchanted Jacob when she can just read his mind and see that he's already in love with her? 

2) This one is maybe something I missed but why would she torn a postcard from her sister and leave it at Newt's house? Grindelwald later said something like that a path was set for Credence to follow, maybe this was part of the ""setting"".

3) At the end she was too quick to join Grindelwald, it was like she was in a trance.

Some people speculated that she was placed under Imperius or something like that in Paris but I think she might have already been Imperiused in the US by Abernathy.

1353,composinkid,1542268891,"All of this is my opinion, of course...FULL ON SPOILERS BELOW.

&amp;#x200B;

**What Worked**

1. The VFX were really freaking good.
2. Further exploration of the wizarding world existing in other countries.
3. Newt's basement.
4. The beasts.
5. Queenie's development.
6. The subtle yet not subtle hints about Dumbledore and Voldemort's past.
7. Jude Law as Dumbledore.
8. Grindelwald as a character and how he differs from Voldemort.
9. Hogwarts.

**What Didn't Work (oh boy...)**

1. Leta Lestrange's confusing af backstory. (Was shipped to America, but then still went to Hogwarts? Is that how it works? Also everything about her lineage was unnecessarily convoluted.)
2. Honestly, almost everything about Leta. As much as I wanted to like her character.
3. Jacob's retcon. He remembered everything because the potion only makes people forget the bad stuff? Huh? At the end of the first movie he CLEARLY didn't remember anything. A better example would literally have been that somehow Queenie restored his memory. 
4. Yusuf Kama. Wtf.
5. Tina's story. She really didn't do much which is sad because of how great she was in the first movie.
6. McGonagall somehow being there when she's not even supposed to be born yet???
7. The editing/scenes being cut that affected the story. Example: Jacob enters crypt. Unseen person holds a wand to his head. We cut away. The next time we see Jacob is when the doorway opens up to lead to Grindelwald's rally, and he's... fine? Just standing there in the doorway? Nobody even reacts to him being there?
8. Speaking of Jacob, he seems to go a lot of places where you wouldn't think Muggles would be able to. Example: Through the statue in Paris to that like.. alternate place where the circus was? They LET HIM GO TO HOGWARTS?
9. Grindelwald's plan. His whole goal is trying to recruit Credence, and yet the steps he takes to reach that goal don't seem to tie together. He KNOWS where Credence is, and even shows up to talk to him on a roof (lol) so why not try to convince him to join right there? Why do all this nonsense plotting to get him to the rally when he could have said the exact same thing right then? The part where the guy kills Credence's mother's servant and reports back that she's dead (as if that was the plan all along)... why? What did that do? It's not like the servant would have known the truth about Credence and killing her stopped him from finding out. Also Grindelwald barely does anything the whole movie except like... live in an apartment in Paris. 
10. The end battle with the fire dragons which seemed tacked on just to have a spectacle.
11. In extension, Nicolas Flamel showing up at the end to... save the day?...
12. Lack of structure. The movie really didn't have much of a beginning, middle, or end. It just kind of... went. It's clearly the middle of the series, but the difference between this and Harry Potter is that every HP movie still told it's own story with character and plot development. This movie seemed to barely have either of those.
13. Nagini. Could have been an exciting character, ended up being pointless.
14. Changing what the Mirror of Erised does. (It shows what someone truly desires, correct? So why would it show Dumbledore a memory? If his biggest desire was that he DIDN'T create that blood oath or whatever with Grindelwald, it would have shown him NOT doing it.)
15. The easy solutions to problems. Too much reliance on ""here's this random and new piece of magic to help them solve this problem"". Examples: Newt tracking Tina by using some kind of gold dust? Being locked in a cell but it's ok, the guy locking them up just so happened to pass out at the perfect time and one of Newt's creatures picks the magic lock easily?
16. The pacing and plotting. It seemed like some of the action scenes were thrown in just to add some excitement. Example: the battle within the French Ministry. It didn't feel organic at all.
17. Newt somehow knowing about a ""box"" inside the French Ministry that would prove Credence's lineage? 
18. The scene where all of that black fabric flies through the city and covers all the buildings and then... goes away? Explained as Grindelwald calling his followers but.... what???? Does this happen in like an alternate version of Paris from the Muggle world or do Muggles just not notice this happening?
19. The title. Crimes of Grindelwald? What is this referring to in terms of what happens in the movie?
20. Two words: Aurelius Dumbledore.

JK Rowling is a brilliant writer and clearly has this sprawling vision in her head, but there's a difference between writing a novel and writing a script. Fingers crossed next time she's not the only writer on the movie and actually has someone help craft it into a film that makes sense.

So in that scene where Grindelwald shows his vision we see the upcoming bad things, Muggles are going to do. Especially the 2nd World War and the Atomic bomb. How did Grindelwald know this stuff? I think he traveled time. Someone on reddit said one day, that he thinks, time travel will be a big deal in CoG because the word ""time"" is used several times in the trailer and we hear a clicking clock. I've watched the movie and we see a lot of clocks, but nobody is talking about time travel. 

Then I see Grindelwald and Dumbledore. They are nearly the same age, right? But Dumbledore looks good in 1929, while Grindelwald looks much older - and whats wrong with his eye? 

So maybe he traveled time?! That would explain why he looks older and more used and why he knows the stuff, that happens in the 40s in Europe and Nagasaki...

-Tina and Queenie
- “More than Brothers”
- Leta and Corvus
- a prophesy possibly having to do with siblings 
- it being mentioned at some point that having a sibling can help an Obscurial 
- then finally Aurelius’ brother is looking for/after/against him

At first leaving the theater I was somewhat disappointed. And I’ve been looking for an explanation all day about this “new” Dumbledore since none of the timelines match up. I will continue to look for a logical explanation.

If you can help out please do.

The only thing I can come up with is that we don’t know much about Aberforth. But we do know that Grindelwald knows a lot more about the Dumbledores than most. His aunt was one of the greatest magical historians and was a friend of and lived near the family. They are known as a powerful family.

If Grindelwald continued to follow the lives of Albus and Aberforth after Ariana’s death, he might know that Aberforth or Honoria might have had a family/lover.

If that is the case and one of them had children, then the story could be plausible. The kids would be true Dumbledores and Grindelwald could have tracked one down to New York and just so happened to find out he’s an Obscurial.

The thing is, in the movie it’s set up to say he is a Dumbledore and his brother is after him. Well what if that’s true?

In the first act of the movie, in the moment that Grindelwald arrives in Paris , his followers enter in a house and kill its owners. Moments later we found out that there is a baby, recently orphan, alone in a room of that house. Next, one of the followers of Grindelwald enter in the room, close the door and we see a green light from the known 'Avada Kedavra' flashing inside giving us the impression that the fate of the children was the same as his parents.

It is right now that this theory appears: what if the baby didn't died and he is in the reality, Tom Marvolo Riddle???

It happens that Tom Riddle born in December of 1926 and the movie occurs in 1927, in fact, that children doesn't looks like to have more than 1 year old...

* disapparating onto hogwarts grounds... yeah no.
* entire storyline surrounding yusef (or whats his name) is just tossed out with no closure on his side whatsoever
* leta dying, why exactly? I hope to god they are not using that as an excuse that she sacrificed herself and gave the most powerful ancient magic of all for her true love or some BS like that, would completely invalidate all that made HP special
* ""you're a lestrange!"" ""No he's not"" ""indeed, you are a dumbledore!"" Wat
* speaking of, dumbledore casually talking about the death of his sister, which was supposedly one of the big hidden secrets he never discussed?
* nicholas flamel showing up at the end to do something something to save paris from destruction which was no problem at all until he mentions it and is then no big deal anymore 2 minutes in
* so much casual usage of magic, spells, whatnot, which all took loads of build up in the original HP series. Apparently everyone is super powerful and amazing at magic?
* new dumbledore knows how to do magic with a wand the moment he picks it up, while everyone else spends years in school to even learn how to make a piece of paper fly? Please

I could go on but my point is clear I think. The IP for the HP universe is super strong and could potentially remain a franchise for a long time to come. But at this pace I half expect them to take on thanos and revive the avengers in the next film. This has all the sheen and glamour of harry potter but none of the actual storylining and depth I so appreciated about harry potter.

1376,RedSiren2,1542220262,"(Often even against old movie stereotypes)

While on YouTube, I often come across people lashing out on the first Fantastic Beasts movie - while I do understand that it feels weird at first to see a world we knew from books and movies now only on screen, I think many people are overlooking a hell of a lot that can be easily noticed when watching the movie a second time … or even just thinking about it a little while longer.

(Sorry to be so fangy, but it upsets me every time - I love this movie and how much there is to discover and love, and it breaks my heart to see when people insult it)

So, here are 20 things I love about the first movie :)

Enjoy (and pass it on if you want to, I think more people deserve to know the beauty of this movie)

________________________________


1. The movie passes the Bechdel‘s test – only in short doses, but it’s there … Queenie and Tina talk about dinner, Tina and Bernadette during the execution, and president Piquery, I think intentionally, doesn’t let Tina talk about the man she brought in

2. Lovely characters – the first thing I felt when I started to get into this fandom is how much I loved the main squad, and how much love each of them expressed throughout the movie – they are deeply good, which makes me hold each of them very dear.

3. It’s a Rowling story – it’s rich, widely vined and full of things that are to come back later during the series – and there is more to take note of every time you watch it (and to theorize :3)

4. Female characters – human ones. No matter if Tina, the sometimes clumsy but the deeply heroic woman who’s main purpose, no matter if in her job or outside, is the well-being of humans, Queenie, who, while very girly, can stand her own ground very well and proves to be of great help, or Seraphina Piquery, a well-established poilitician who knows her priorities – she doesn’t make the right choices all the time and sticks a lot to the rules of the time, but in that she does not differ from most people in such a position, male or female. Also the Goldstein sisters are both shown saving a man in a way – that’s gotta count for something.

5. Male characters – human ones. This movie doesn’t need male movie stereotypes either – we meet Percival Graves, and what we see of him (I think Grindelwald did adapt his character) is a trustworthy, patient man who didn’t gain Tina’s respect just like that… and we meet Credence Barebone, a young man abused and starved physically and emotionally, who yet stands in for his little sister, knowing exactly how severe the punishment was going to be – and ready to never let it happen to her, even when she revealed the truth. Even Abernathy, who was rather unfriendly to Tina, showed a very genuine side when it came to Queenie (his expressions weren’t sinister, he would be a gentleman to her). Our lead Newt Scamander is a shy, awkward nerd, who yet shows heart, bravery and humanity that seeks its equal – which he finds in Jacob Kowalski, who seems like the chubby comic relief at first, but then reveals a heart of nothing but gold, a purpose in the story, and such a beautiful mind that Queenie falls in love with him… which brings me to the next point.

6. Romance done right – Queenie falls in love with Jacob, because on the inside, he is the most beautiful man she has ever met – talk about a story of inner values done right. And the romance between Newt and Tina starts slowly, patiently – both because of their shy personalities and a more authentic take on love than most movies are willing to show.

7. Newt, Tina, Jacob, Queenie and Credence all cry at some point, the first two even twice … I don’t know if I’ve ever seen this in a movie. And I think they cry quiet realistically … not to mention that, by showing the male leads crying, we get the message that this is alright, something we don’t get very often in general cinema.

8. All women we meet have a job and are pretty badass in their own way – Tina is a former auror (a woman of the law), Queenie is a clerk and stands up for her sister and the group, Madame Piquery is president of the wizarding community of the united states of America and no-nonsense, and the executioners we meet are one man and two women. And, though I don’t like it, I have to mention that Mary Lou Barebone is shown to be one of the leaders of the Second Salemers movement. Her adoptive daughter Chastity is a serious worker for her cause (though doesn’t share her character) and even little Modesty shows strength when she not only dares to own a toy wand as a Salemer, but also is willing to take the punishment for it – and for Credence. Not to mention the way she stares at Henry Shaw when he calls him a freak and reassuringly takes his hand upon leaving. She’s not modest about standing up for those she loves, that’s for sure.

9. The characters act awkward at some points, especially socially, and shy – but that is what makes them believable. They are deeply good and, honestly, very real people with weaknesses, who don’t always know what to say or how to react – but what they say and do works very well, and makes for personalities one can not only relate, but often even look up to – especially every single time they stand up for what they believe in 

10. The actors do a magnificent job, period. You can tell how much they love the characters they play, and that they know the value of being part of this universe. Also, can we talk about how sweet they are during interviews, also with each other? Cast chemistry, Outstanding.

11. The lighting of the film is comfortable and pretty real (not to be underestimated)

12. The score by James Newton Howard is beautiful (Thunderbird and New York theme forever)

13. The costumes tie into their characters/developments/actions and deseve the Oscar they got

14. The villain isn’t exactly a beautiful womanizer – and let’s face it, he is supposed to be a man in his late 40’s, and by that point looking like that… but he is accordingly extremely good at persuading people.. He does it with his ideas and by manipulating them, which makes for a very interesting story.

15. This story has a purpose – it’s not just entertainment. It’s the coming of adult age that follows the coming of age of Harry Potter, JK Rowlings way to give advise to the fans who grew up with Harry and now enter life as young adults … and it’s a story about how fascism can draw people in, how certain ideologies can split societies … and what can be done against it, especially by people who are rather unexpected in this fight.

16. There are awkward moments – but everyone who read Harry Potter will tell you that funny, sometimes quite slapstick moments were scattered all over the entire story – Peeves, the Weasley twins, tools at the burrow, all kinds of jokes, things that happened at Hogwarts, Privet Drive and especially during the Quidditch world cup (remember Archie) – just remember that every time something goofy happens on screen, it’s just JK’s humor which didn’t make it that much into the original films

17. The case, the creatures – the CGI is difficult sometimes, but wandering around the wonderful world Newt has created, the way his creatures act and the relationships he has with all of them are so sweet it almost makes me cry

18. It gave less known actors a chance to shine… and boy, did they :)

19. The setting was chosen very well - makes me want to travel to Liverpool :)

20. Like the HP universe in general, it played very well with real life social conflicts and even included issues of the time, like separation inside of human societies, looking down on people because of their position/history, and what effect this has ",FantasticBeasts,"20 ways how ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"" works perfectly",https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9x2psy/20_ways_how_fantastic_beasts_and_where_to_find/,1542191462.0

Credence his ""true"" identity is revealed in the last scene. A big plot twist wich had my jaw drop to the floor and i kept saying o my god. After giving us the red herring of him being a lestrange,  which had many people theroy crafting for months he turned out not to be one. We went from Credence Barebone to Corvus Lestrange V to Aurelius Dumbledore. How that works out since mr.(brian?) Dumbledore died in azkaban when albus was quite young and kendra (mom) died when albus was in his late teens and movie jude law dumbledore is quite a bit older this puzzles me.

The thing about all the names and identities and infantcide surrounding credence reminds me of a character from the mortal instruments. It is a book series based on harry potter (main character is a girl name clary..) which has been arpund for 10 years. In the story there is another character who almost has a new ""true"" identity/name every book along with a lot of false ones, switching babies etc. This reminded me greatly of what they are doing with credence now.",FantasticBeasts,Spoiler about Credence,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9x0zzm/spoiler_about_credence/,1542180128.0

1394,Inspire_Forever,1542165322,"Ok, so from what we have learned about Leta’s and Theseus’s relationship, we see they are engaged. People have been saying she didn’t love Theseus (Theseus loved her though) but loved Newt. I don’t agree! Throughout the film we see the little moments they have together, in the beginning at the ministry when Leta was talking to Newt and Theseus came up she smiled, she hadn’t seen her best friend in ages but smiled when he came. Also when they are about to leave to fight Grindelwald and they kiss, she clearly seems to care deeply for him. Also in Hogwarts when she reminisces about her and Newt, of course she does, she spent a large part of her childhood with him. Now when they were at Hogwarts she probably had a crush on him and we know he had a crush on her. It doesn’t mean she still loves him. Also why would she get engaged to his brother if she wanted to be with him. It would drive her and Newt farther away from each other and pretty much ruin there chances of getting together. We don’t really learn exactly how her and Theseus get together. I suspect they cut a flashback because in the trailer the part with the dancing girl we see both Leta and Theseus. There is no other plot point this would fit in with except how they got together.  In the end scene before Leta dies she tells Newt and Theseus “I love you.” We don’t know who she was saying it to but I think she loved both of them.

1395,Inevitabilidade,1542164015,"Cinematography and action directing are gorgeous. I get why some people like the Yatesian action directing style, but I think it sells high stakes to an audience. I watched it in 3D and that helps a *lot*, the use of depth lends itself well to the particular style of action throughout the movie.
Good use of cinematography and colour palette; it's well constructed and it makes sense, there's color where color needs to be, in the circus, at hogwarts, when you think credence is finally about to finda some answers, and desaturates after credence's outburst, after leta's death and the successful thwarting of Grindewald's blue fire (fiendfyre? some very.... very similar alternative even though someone shoulnd't be able to stop fiendfyre with finites as far as im aware) (beautiful sound design in this scene). Also in the coffee shop scene waiting for Yusuf where our main boys are moping about their ladies' running about without them.


As to the story:


I wish they had developed Yusuf's story, for god's sake. Badly done exposition and rushed. I expected somewhat how this was all going to go down, namely the relations and half-siblinghood and some sort of betrayal in there somewhere, but it was still confusing for me.


Leta is my main point of contention: terrible and pointless death; it feels as though she needs to die so Theseus doesn't 'get her' because the whole business upsets Newt, but also a convenient way to get rid of her so she doesn't get in the way of Newt+Tina. She didn't need to fight Grindewald like that, every other named character came out of that ordeal *fine* (except the one bloke that disintegrates, and I'm still rather confused on whether the auror at the beginning, the man Grindewald delivers the 'would you kill Dumbledore if I asked?' speech, and the poor disintegrated soul at the end there are all the same person. I need to watch this again so I can track insignificant charaters better). She could've developed in many interesting was, had a deption arc to go through, but her 'redemption' is... Throwing like, half a spell at Grindewald. Hooray. Who actually saves the day is Nicolas Flamel, of all people, and also 'everyone else'.


Queenie going evil: entirely expected, and thank god for them keeping this in. Her using the charm on Jacob also adds to her character and she's there at the top with my favourites for this series; she has a very lax understanding of boundaries and subversion of will, and I think she's hitching an entirely new ride to boot. I'd wager that either Grindewald and co. or just the ominous lady that doesnt get a name (does she?)can perform some... wide-range occlumency; she's out of her depth with people she can't read. She'sused to trusting people, and that comes accross well; I like where this is going as far as she's concerned.


With Tina, I am betting she's getting 'caught up in the moment' with Newt and their relationship will hit other snags since she's with someone else. If this poor bloke that hasn't yet even received screentime is dropped before he has a chance to appear.... then that'll be trash, won't it? Other than relationship reasons she doesn't get much agency in this movie, which is sad, but I didn't terribly mind. The entire movie feels a bit like a set-up for the next, and that doesn't make it bad, it's just hard to judge it with all these missing pieces.


Jude Laws' dumbledore is a pleasure to see, and the fact he teaches DADA instead of transfigurations is not the worst mistake in the world. I don't love McGonnagal is in this movie for a cameo, but then again, it's a cameo, so I don't mind much. Flamel is a goddamn delight though. That lil' run! Look at him go! Who was in that book though?(dead wife? she's supposed to be alive still at this point, isn't she?) And why are they trying to urge him to action?


As for newt: I love him. I always will, every second he's on screen, but he doesn't get much character growth in this movie. He makes a slight towards tina via letter and that's fixed via... endearingly weird compliments; which, maybe fair enough, jury is still out on that one; and at the end there seems he's gonna take care of Theseus and be more of a brother now that leta's dead, and we'll still have to see where tha goes. As I've mentioned, the movie feels entirely transitional.


The blood pact: I'm curious about it, but cautiously. I hope this isn't some cursed child level invention, and dumbledore's 'maybe' is intriguing. I wonder what it will take to destroy it. It'll probably have something that'll tie in with some magical beast, very probably fawkes, which brings me to:



The phoenix: who was Fawkes?? Very probably?? How did Credence even find the baby? Is it from that circus cage? But i didn't think those were phoenixes. They wanted to draw a parallel before the reveal with newt giving Leta the raven and mentioning how it was a Lestrange thing, and then credence is there with a baby bird that's similarso we think it was a raven but it's actually a phoenix, as we thought he was Lestrange but he's actually a Dumbledore? Which brings me to:


Credence/Corvus/Aurelius/How many bloody names is this poor bloke gonna have? If he actually *is* a Dumbledore like Ggrindewald says, and all sings point to yes from a cinematographical/choice of allegory perspective (unless they're laying it on too thick? But switching his identity again seems... too much, if they were going with that. Should've spent more time with the lestrange thing if that were the case). Actually, they should've spent more time on the Lestrange thing regardless. Very expected thing for people who overanalyse and had 10 theories ready to go, but otherwise it's rushed as all get out Credence thinks he's a Lestrange for maybe a minute, thanks to Yusuf and Leta for explaining this to Credence in a very ordered and too-calm fashion before killing him (on Yusuf's part), and that's immediately dropped with Leta's reveal. Felt a bit cheap of a blow, though less cheap when you've built up the identity of Corvus Lestrange throughout the year of speculation. Watching these back to back will probably feel odd.



And as for him being a Dumbledore... With the current timeline as we know it, it doens't work very well. But Albus' biography was written by skitter and corroborated by doge, and all we have is that and Albus' and Harry's little afterlife conversation. I'll hope it's not some cursed child level shenanigans happening, I'll not condemn the twist as a whole, this doesn't ruin it all (yet) but I'm not fond.



Albus needs to get that phoenix at some point though.


Maybe credence's dad is aberforth and his mom is a goat?


I'm pretty sure Grindy wanted to imply siblinghood there, but it was pretty damn well established there were only Aberforth, Albus and Arianna... that there's a fourth is a bit too much retconning, especially since Arianna was already 'socially rejected' but kept by her family, there's no reason to throw Credence out the window.
Actually, maybe Credence is Arianna's son? those muggles that hated her and bullied her maybe raped her? That'd make some sense, especially since he's an obscurus (obscurial? I can never recall which refers to which) and so was she. If it turns out to be this I won't be half mad, actually, but I still wonder why the blazing hells he ended up in America. Dumbledore wouldn't just let his sister's kid go wherever after her death. He already had enough guilt about it all. Baby Credence had an adult woman caring for him on the titanic at that point, when they were apparently switched, who was she?

They had people dressed as Newt and Tina so you could take a picture and they were also giving away presents for the lucky few. A voucher for the screenplay book. That's where the good part ends. The movie was late, and when they were showing trailers for upcoming 3D movies, the picture was blurry. We thought the problem was with the glasses, so I went out to get new ones, as did many others. But sadly the problem persisted when the movie started. The image was so blurry that you couldn't see Johnny Depps's face clearly at all in the close shot. Completely unwatchable.  So we left after 10,15 mins with a lot of other people, thinking they would fix it and play again. Nope! We waited for almost an hour for nothing to happen, with the managers saying there didn't seem to be anything wrong with it! Pissed! 

This is the first time I walked out of a screening and I understand that there could have a problem with their copy or something, but they should have checked it before they played it. The bloody first screening! Cancel the whole thing if it's not working, damn it. Don't waste my time. I won't be able to see it again until next week because my schedule is packed(sigh). I am angry, but sad most of all. End post. Thanks for letting me vent. I hope everybody else enjoyed the movie today.

1399,Scarlettcox,1542149229,"So,just left the movie theatre, a little confused, and a little underwhelmed.
My first and most important question, could  Credence be the brother of Dumbledore? Is it canon? I haven’t read the books in some time but I cant remember any references except Ariana and Abeforth
On the other hand the Phoenix part makes sense to me so I’m really confused 
Secondly, what about Grindewald’s character, ( and I’m not talking about Johnny Depp’s acting,I really like him and I don’t mind him playing Grindewald). In my opinion,especially in the cemetary scene where he is talking about muggles and WW2 , they made him seem like a good leader that just wants to protect wizards, not necessarily killing muggles that mean no harm, and that really contrasts with what I had in my mind ( that he is very similar to Voldemort)
And lastly, what about Queenie, is she bad after all,or just confused?

Sorry for the long post, I really would like to read some opinions on these subjects or anything about the movie, Thanks ❤️

1400,MadSwedishGamer,1542148113,"Yeah, so, what did you think of the new film? I personally didn't like it all that much, especially because it felt like Leta was only really there to give exposition, and we didn't really get enough time to care about her as a character before she was killed. Also, Nagini was hyped up so much despite barely being in the film at all, and she didn't serve much of a purpose with only a few lines of dialogue (also-also, her dress looked like it'd be really cold to walk around in during autumn). Tina also felt like she was mostly there as a plot hook, unlike in the first film.

They weren't kidding when they said this movie was dark. Most of the film had a sad undertone/feeling to it.   
I was initially iffy about some of the casting choices (particularly Jude Law and Johnny Depp) but they absolutely nail it. I LOVE this Dumbledore!   
I liked the beasts in this movie and thought they were well utilized. There were a lot fewer ""silly"" beasts moments in this one, probably because of the overall darker movie in general.  
I am very attached to the main 5 characters from the first film, but I loved the new characters! Although the movie isn't exactly fast-paced, I found myself wishing it were longer so that we could have explored them even more!

1512,RBB39,1540262034,"So I am sure most of us are aware that we will get to see how Dumbledore became the man we know in Harry Potter.

A big part of Dumbledore's philosophy is everyone deserves a second chance.  Maybe we could begin to see a Dumbledore who doesn't believe in that early in the series and see him develope in that way latter on.

I think that he just really liked Newt and maybe he new it was Leta's fault and Newt convinces him to not rant her out. (Talking about Newt's expulsion, we know it was caused by endangering student's lives, but was really caused by Leta)

I am hoping to see this because it is a huge part of Dumbledore's phylosophy and I am curious to know who will make him think that way (or to better put that: who will deserve a second chance but not get one and how will Dumbledore know about that).  Could it be Grindelwald?  In DH Dumbledore says Grindelwald has felt remorce for what he has done.  Could he have started to fell that earlier but had gone to far to turn back?

1546,InteractiveArtistry,1539237039,"[Gellert Grindelwald](https://imgur.com/gallery/DUpoY2Q) might be my favourite character that Johnny Depp has ever played. 

Not just because of what we’ve seen of his performance so far, but because the role represents what I believe creative work is best for: exorcising/channeling darkness into art.

This film is called *The Crimes* of Grindelwald,

But I can’t help but feel that will end up referring to more than just his violent atrocities on muggle and wizard alike. There are other crimes one can commit - crimes of the heart, of the soul. Of passion, perhaps.

I’m curious to see how complex this portrayal will be. In what twisted way will he rationalise his extremist views? How vulnerable will we see him, especially around Dumbledore? 

How ruthless will he be? 

How frightened will he be, deep down? 

So many layers. Depp’s Grindelwald has the potential to be an immensely rich character. Tragic, unsettling, frightening, but also wounded, insecure, lost...What’s more, the history of cinema has shown that the best performances come from a personal place of familiarity — Depp, like Grindelwald, has been vilified for his actions, and those feelings of being misjudged, or misunderstood...that anger, that resentment — he’ll be able to feed all of that pain into Gellert, and do what art is best for: a cathartic outlet to channel drama into creativity, rather than letting it in one’s personal life. 

Then there’s the aspect of *mystery* — some things may end up never being explored or explained, cueing us to fill the gaps with our own interpretations...

In that sense, I think Gellert is exactly who Depp needs right now, as an artist and as a person — the exact right character he needs to move through (possibly years of unexpressed) darkness. There’s even a chance he took the role precisely *because* he himself felt like a villain — perhaps Gellert has done the same? 

Started with good intensions, came to be feared, resented people for seeing him that way, and choosing to fulfil those fears. I think venting your darkness in a creative way is the healthiest possible way to process it, for sure. Cannot wait for November, for the next chapters of the Wizarding World, for Mr. Depp’s future works, and beyond.

My thinking behind these is if Grindelwald gets a title, why not Dumbledore? He’s a big part of the story and we will likely get his back story on screen at some point. 

The Greater Good has to do specifically with the relationship between the two. Then finally Rowling has already hinted at the series ending with the legendary duel between them.

1568,LoroConure25,1538567634,"So, I was sitting the other day after recently finishing re-reading the Potter books and ended up online going through forums based on links between the novels and the upcoming FB movies. 

I was totally fangurling (I’m a bloke) on the revelations around Nagini, and started thinking about other magical creatures throughout the books and how they could be brought into the movies. 

I came to Fawkes, and stopped short. Surely, there MUST be a backstory  to be shown for how Dumbledore met the Phoenix. It would all tie in with the Fantastic Beasts franchise, and would be another link-in with the Potter books/films. 

I have a feeling that this would be too good an opportunity to miss for JKR; I now imagine Newt has something to do with Dumbledore and Fawkes coming together. If this does come about in the upcoming CoG, it could be along the lines of Fawkes being captive in this magical circus, and that he is mistreated/abused for the amusement/wonder of the gold-paying public. 

Newt/Dumbledore, investigating the ‘Snake-Woman’ act now known to be Nagini, witnesses the Phoenix being brought on to the stage as a dazzling closing-piece of the show, and can see how neglected he is, and so vows to save him. 

I also think there is a chance Fawkes’ tears, which have crazy-good healing powers, could be being misused in the circus against his will to cure any injuries within the circus, including the likes of Nagini’s venomous bites (as seen in OotP with Arthur Weasley, extremely difficult to cure). 

This could also explain how Fawkes knew Harry was in need of his tears in CoS after his near-deadly battle with the Basilisk...

I’m probably thinking way too deeply about this, but it would all explain a lot about the relationship between Fawkes and Dumbledore, they were companions through until the latters death, whereby Fawkes displays his sadness through the ‘Phoenix’s Lament’, emitting a ghostly and extremely sorrowful song at the loss of his friend before he leaves Hogwarts. 

This kind of shows to me that he was there with Dumbledore voluntarily, of his own will, and most likely NOT as a pet, and had a huge understanding of the events ongoing around him, displaying compassion and intelligence beyond that of a common ‘pet’, even for a magical one. 

I did tweet JKR a few days ago with a short question about all of this, but understandably and predictably I never got a reply haha. 

Does anyone think I’m completely wrong, or right, or have any predictions of their own? ",FantasticBeasts,Fawkes,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9l0g37/fawkes/,1538538834.0

Are you hoping for Mounts? If so, which?

Who are you hoping to come across in this game? Nicolas Flamel, perhaps?

What pivotal events would you like to see portrayed or alluded to in the game?

1575,Inefable51332,1538236903,"I was searching about this thing because that eye gots me totally baffled and I am quite surprised no one seemed to think of this theory; at least as far as I've read.  
Ok, my guess is as follows: that sometime just after meeting Dumbledore, Grindelwald used everything he learnt from him to gain more power, and to overpower Dumbledore, and that not only meant he found and stole the Elder Wand, but also that he performed some kind of Transfiguration or Dark Spell to gain some kind of ""sight"".  
And this is not so unlikely, in my opinion, for the following:  
1) There are certain similarities between his and Mad Eye's, but Grindelwald's definitively still his or, at least, it seems so. Yet, it looks completely different, so prominently and big as the magical eye of Moody so it is logical to a certain extent to assume it has some kind of power (in the Wizarding World, as we all know, things rarely occur at random so I don't think this a case of heterochromía iridium).  
2) He studied at Durmstrang, from where he was expelled for his ""twisted experiments"" and the school itself is known to be located somewhere in the north. Myths and folklore often make their crooked way into the Wizarding World and the northern lands hold the story of the Eye of Odin.  
3) Oding actually sacrificed one of his eyes ""for wisdom"" (according to some myths, actually the prophetic power) although he didn't loose sight, but gained new understanding.  
4)  Now, my guess is that this ""sight"" he gained is perhaps a ""future sight"" or a ""past sight"" or something of the like, although I'm betting of the first, since Rowling confirmed he was a Seer and in the trailer it is mentioned that he ""had a vision"".  
If he knew about the ""probabilty sight"" of the Demiguises, I think he would go and try to Transfigure/Switching it to himself, as that, paired with the Elder Wand, would make him really unstoppeable, although it could just be another kind of future-sight (or another kind of sight altoguether, albeit definitively magical).",FantasticBeasts,Theory about Grindelwald's Eye,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9jy2dm/theory_about_grindelwalds_eye/,1538208103.0
1576,RBB39,1538233630,"So I have been thinking and you guys seem to like the idea in [this coment](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9ju4bf/the_hero_we_need_right_now/e6u9inb?utm_source=reddit-android) that Human Nagini might be good and the Snake Nagini evil.  Then I replyed to a comenter (I don't want to see anyone downvote him please we where sharing thoughts lets respect everyone's speach plz) and proposed the idea that maybe the Women and Snake Nagini and two seperate enteties (like when Ginny is possested by the memory of Tom in CoS) (or maybe she can remember, like if she were a spectator (like us in a movie theater, we can't interact with the movie, we can only sit and watch) and sees everything Snake Nagini does, but can't interact with her.

So bassicaly Women Nagini would be a nice person fearing her condition and fearing that she will lose her humanity.  In a tweet (couldn't find it I swear this acting controversy has made it so much harder to find) Claudia Kim or JK Rowling say that Nagini will be fighting for her humanity, not wanting to turn into the beasts we know she will become.

And then I wondered, what if Maledictus' turn forever into a beast because their beast form (wich I have theoriesed of being a seperate entity) because the beast wants to be present full time.  What if the Snake wasn't powerfull enough until 25+ years to stay completely into snake form and that the Human Nagini is powerfull enough to change back into a human.  And then, at some point Snake Nagini would be more powerfull that Human Nagini and the Snake would be in control.  (This is working great, it explains why Humain Nagini will be afraid of her snake form and maybe we could see her randomly transform into a snake only because the snake entity is itself wanting to be a full-time being).

So to recapitulate, when a Maledictus is in a form (lets say human) it has its other form (snake of Nagini's case) in itself and it can see what the other one is doing (the same aplyes vice-versa).  Then when Human Nagini transform is at will until the Snake's Maledictus powers become too powerfull, so it isn't that the curse will enevitably transform Nagini into a snake, but more like the Snake will have enough power to stay into Snake form forever, but the Snake can still chose to become humain, but since it isn't really her, why would she do so?

Maybe the snake gathers more power as she is present in the real world.

I believe that although we know the names “Nagini” and “Merope Gaunt”, perhaps the former is a nickname. 

We know from Claudia Kim, who will portray Nagini, that she wants to stay human and be human. What better way to remain human, than birthing a child and creating that human connection. We know that Voldemort can see via Nagini, but perhaps, Nagini can also see through Voldemort. This allows her to “be human”, without maintaining a human form. 

Nagini becomes willing to be a horcrux because she knows this will allow her to achieve her wishes and immortalize her son. 

Separated from her son, this would make it easier for Nagini to find her son and assuage him to keep her close as a pet/companion. She knows what to say to keep him interested. She could be the one to convince him to create horcruxes in the first place, and perhaps he takes it to a more extreme level with 7.  But her goal is to become one and become human. 

This leads to more questions, who is the father? I believe this to be Credence and perhaps he is the one who curses Tom Riddle Sr. so that he believes Voldemort is his son and can ensure he gets to a muggle orphanage. We know Credence and Nagini are close, how close, remains to be seen. 

This would still make Voldemort a descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Still worth pondering if perhaps Salazar is related to the idea of Maledictus and he cursed his bloodline to pass on the parseltongue gene (curse gone wrong? Or right? He’s the basilisk in the chamber of secrets? I digress).

Regardless, I still believe Nagini is Voldemort’s mother. And I look forward to this next movie and beyond!

There is a creature known as the Lethifold. As stated on the Harry Potter Wiki "" *The* ***Lethifold*** *(also known as the* ***Living Shroud****) was a carnivorous and highly dangerous magical creature. It was also considered a Dark creature because of its aggressive and violent nature.* "" ( Taken from the Harry Potter Wiki page on the Lethifold) This creature is speculated to be related to the dementor. It's favourite prey is humans and it will suffocate them and then devour them. The only way to get rid of a Lethifold is through a Patronus, which is why J.K.Rowling could have stated as to why Newt's patronus is a spoiler.   


I have a theory that the Lethifold is being utilized by Grindlewald to wipe out muggles in Paris, which is another reason as to why Newt is so important due to his knowledge and way with Magical Creatures. However I am unsure if this is correct as I was only reading through magical creatures and came across this.

__________________________________________________________________________________


He’s spent most of his life with Newt, including their school years where he “didn’t really fit in”… despite their differences, I think he understands him extremely well when it comes to his inner mechanisms. … I’m convinced that, outside of the engagement to Leta, he knows how to avoid hurting his feelings. He may even have a similar compassion towards humans as Newt has towards animals… which of course does not mean he despises them.

Callum Turner very quickly said “No” when asked if his character was connected to the greek legend … Theseus was a “beast slayer”, this statement could point to that he would never hurt a magical creature either, furthering how much he values life.

And then there’s his yet obscure history with Leta … I would consider a friendship back at Hogwarts. And no matter how voluntarily their romance was, he must have learned how to treat her when she dealt with her issues (”damaged” and“confused”, as well as the sadness in her face when she’s about to face the boggart, may point to mental illness/trauma)… maybe even back at school along with Newt? Maybe in connection to what he knew about treating him?

The last factor could be his urge to helping people … he was one of the wizards who defied the ministries’ orders to not interfere in WWI, and rescued countless muggles. We can assume that he thinks and acts much like Tina when it comes to protecting others from harm and comforting them when it’s required.

(Side note: beautiful as this sounds, this quality might make him more open to Grindelwald’s cause than we know … he’s been through a war, he wants to protect muggles - what if he convinces him that wizards will be allowed to keep up the peace between them in the new world? Theseus is a hero, of course, but … does he want to live in a world where’s he’s forced to stay hidden when having the ability to save lives?)

1668,RedSiren2,1533639400,"Hi there 😊

Once in a while, I come across people saying that Credence might die during the series, some saying Jacob might… now, I usually brush this aside mentally with a “No. Main characters.” but I think we all feel the same … the more often you read something, the more you start to think about it … so I tried to sum up a bunch of reasons for why these two are definitely going to survive the series. Enjoy 😊

______________________________________________________________


**Jacob**

From the beginning of the first movie on, we are shown around the World of Jacob Kowalski… we follow him around, even when he’s alone … something we get rarer with Tina and Queenie, who we know have lived … he’s being established as a main character.

Why do we meet him, and see so much? It’s because he is bringing a balance to the group. He’s not as tall and pretty as the others, he’s the comic relief, has no magical powers, and, most of all, reacts with awe to the wizarding world as we do… as someone in a review on the movie in Germany once said, he’s the reflection of the audience of JK Rowlings world.

But this is only the first sight. Over the course of the movie, his balance part is accompanied by a heartwarming spirit … he wants to open up a bakery to make people happy, becomes a close friend to a man who most of the time “annoys people”, even establishes himself as his assistant as they roam New York, and especially Queenie bonds with him over his honesty and good heart, and points out that his mind his unique… even Tina, who only had small interactions with him, cries as they have to leave him in the obliviating rain.

Jacob is a too valid, too established piece of the set we have been introduced to … leave alone the fact that he has become a fan favorite. Admittedly, it will be a challenge to protect him throughout the coming movies… but not impossible. Who knows what they can do to ensure his safety… we’re only at the beginning of learning much more about the wizarding world. Also, couldn’t it be an advantage to have someone from the non-magic world for the plots against Grindelwald? He’s got a bit of a different perspective from life in his world – which would be harder to add for Credence as he has spent his life in a very reclusive society.

Speaking of him …

____________________________________________________________________________________


**Credence**

Although Credence only started to bond with the group by the end of the first movie, we have been given a view of his world and life that comes close to that of Jacob, even seen through his eyes at one point … and we’ve been presented with the very dark, disturbing story of a young man who was trapped in an abusive home, desperately fighting powers within he couldn’t understand, and would eventually endanger everyone around him… to then be betrayed by Grindelwald and almost killed by the MACUSA.

There has been a theory that Maledictus will eventually kill him – but it was largely based on a recurring fable in Harry Potter, surrounding a raven and a snake, in which the raven would die. In my opinion, there is a limit to what can be repeated throughout a story. Not to mention to how dark it is allowed to get before people can’t stand it any longer.

In my opinion, Credence has suffered more than enough. We all want him to find peace and learn to handle his obscurus … and we’ve seen him almost die already.

So did Tina and Newt … can you imagine how much it would disturb them if they ultimately couldn’t save him? Sure, they may have made him happy until then … but I think there are limits. No one wants to see him die. What the audience, especially the younger members, need, is a story of someone who was severely injured by life several times, but who came back from it… not all stories can end on a perfect happiness note, of course, but … his could at least end with him finding a good life. There is hope for him, and I highly doubt that JK Rowling is going to in the end disappoint us.

Because of course, this series is going to be darker, more mature, but … there are many ways to still write it this way, and as we will meet more characters, there will be a lot more that can die.

Also, he’s said to be the main character aside Grindelwald in the next movie … need I say more? I think we’ll be fine.

Also, once he joins the group, he will have a valid and balancing position as well – he’s am even more quiet person, the youngest, someone who still has to learn much concerning magic and life (once again a little of the audience) but is likely to connect very well with the others, even in ways we’ll have to see yet, even give something back… and eventually evolve a lot, become more confident, even rise to one level or disagree with them once in a while. His change from a traumatized, destroyed young man to a healed, brave and wise adult is another reason why I’m pretty sure he will live.

Not to mention that he is to become one of the most powerful and famous wizards in history – his story doesn’t just end, not even with this series.

________________________________________________________________________


Him and Jacob simply complete this group flawlessly, in a way we all want to see continue.

In my opinion, both are as indisposable as Neville, Ginny and Luna… maybe even Ron and Hermione.  

To conclude this theory, JK Rowling has, I think, never killed someone so we couldn’t overcome it … the main characters are those people usually connect to the most, and if one if them is killed, this part of the fandom will be feeling very betrayed …

There were some deaths, especially during HP7, which were hard to read and watch, but it wasn’t ultimately unbearable … she does think about if we can stand it. And even if this series is going to be darker …  it still needs to make us want more 😊

So, what do you think? Anything to add? (would like to collect some more …)

The group is appearently fighting fiendfyre during the next movie - most likely, the dragonhead dissapears as they shoot it, and Grindelwald should be able to conjure and control it …

__________________________________________________________________________________


**Question**

Since it can destroy Horcruxes, could it harm an Obscurial? I know, those are two pretty distinct entities, but hear me out :

1. Credence has been wounded by the MACUSA while being in visible obscurial form… what happens if he is invisible/less detectable, as when he killed Henry Shaw? Is it more difficult then to harm him … for most forces, but not this?

2. Fiendfyre is said to be extremely dangerous - but we do not know much about it yet, neither about how many things could wound an Obscurial … so it’s at least possible.
Negative option

He completely regenerated after the attack with average magic, but could this fire leave permanent scars that his obscurus can’t make dissapear? Or leave him with needing longer to recover?
Or let’s think a little more positive…

Could he be the **only one** able to effectively hold the fire back, so the others can escape? Maybe it does injure him, even in non-solid form, but he regenerates still.

This may be the final showdown between him and Grindelwald for this movie… maybe one in which he really has to put himself out using magic via hands as we see during the trailer and fighting in non-solid form … all while trying not to loose control over latter due to the immense stress during this battle.

It could lead to an intersting pay-off as he either manages to harm Grindelwald or realizes he cannot do more than keep him slightly in check, while using all his powers ….

This way or another, I’m expecting him to show up eventually during this scene :)",FantasticBeasts,Fiendfyre vs. Obscurials (Theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/93xq7t/fiendfyre_vs_obscurials_theory/,1533172467.0
1677,RBB39,1533114362,"First please watch this [theory](https://youtu.be/qr9a2PaPYJk)
So as we all know, Grindelwald was defeated in 1945 and Seamus states that the end of WWll and Grindelwald's defeat are intricatly tied together.

In the latest trailer, Grindelwald says ""There arrogance is a key to our victory"".  I think he is talking about muggles when he says 'there'.

As Seamus says in his theory, Grindelwald will stop attacking the Wizarding world and start disturbing the Muggle world instead.  Maybe he is controlling The German chancellor of 1933 (not going to type his name here though).

In the part 'History' of this [fandom](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Inferius) page says that Grindelwald wanted an inferius army and in the years 1939 - 1945 we know a lot of people were killed at the fronts and in the camps

I think it is possible that Grindelwald used these bodies to build his army.

1678,RedSiren2,1533108810,"Why is it a small one? Because we have zero information on him yet. 
We have heard about Mrs. Scamander being a hippogriff breeder and having inspired Newt to his career, but her husband ... no info if he's even alive.  

__________________________________________________________


Yet during the first movie, we may have received a subtle hint at him ... I've talked to a fellow tumblr user and when found that when Newt tells Tina how he feels about the laws concerning non-magic people, he appears surprisingly defiant and slightly angry ... he even calls these laws ""absurd"" ... now, this may be as well just him defying the attitude of some ""pure"" wizards in Britain... but I really hope that he stands up for his father here... maybe we'll find out more about him in the sequel, maybe through Theseus? 
Also, it was said that Newt's family was ""not impressed"" with his career choice - which still makes no sense to me. His mother surely supported him, and Theseus must have known this was the best future he could have... but why would his father disagree? Maybe they were just worried for his life? It's a highly dangerous profession after all... 
It has been said that Newt is from a ""ministrial"" family, but so far we only know about Theseus... maybe Mr. Scamander was a wizard after all, but half-blood? Maybe the wizard side of his family mostly didn't agree with Newt's choice...

________________________________________________________________


So many unanswered questions ... well. JK Rowling promised ""all will become clear"" in the next movie, at least concerning Newt's history around Hogwarts and why he was allowed to keep his wand and work for the ministry ... maybe who his father was will be tied into this?

1683,RedSiren2,1532698487,"One thing I recently noticed …

All the characters from Fantastic Beasts were alive in the year the **Titanic** sank.

I’m sure they will mention it during the series … I mean, it was a catastrophe beyond imagining, it still is … an incident that I’m sure left each character being able to recall what they did on that day …

Maybe there were even some wizards on the ship… being as lost as the non-magic as they were too far from the coast to apparate or use a portkey (leave alone the fact that not every wizard can create one).

Given the time they were born, we can imagine some scenes…


______________________________________________________________________________________________


**Hogwarts**

Newt and Leta were around **15**, Theseus maybe **15/16** years in 1912 … which makes me wonder if this influenced Theseus later actions to save muggles during WWI … maybe he decided he would do anything to protect those in need if it was in his power?

Also, was Newt still at Hogwarts then? This is during the year of his expulsion - it would be intersting if Leta and Theseus were alone together on this day … maybe one they bonded over?

__________________________________________________________________________________________


**Illvermorny**

Tina was born in 1901 … so was **11**, in her first year during this incident, perhaps. I actually don’t like that thought much, since it means if Queenie was too much younger than her to be there, they were seperated at the time and latter was all alone with people full off devastating thoughts over the catastrophe … though since she’s able to control it, there is a chance she didn’t listen to too much that day…

And Tina might have had a similar moment as Theseus, deciding to protect humans regardless of their heritage for the rest of her life.


_______________________________________________



Also, if they had returned home for Eastern around this time, and spend a week there after Easter Sunday, they started school again on the 15th of April, so learned of the incident on the 16th. Easter vacation wasn’t common back then, but for boarding schools? I’ll need some help with this.


______________________________________________________________________________


**New York**

On HP wiki, Jacob’s year of birth is said to be 1899/1900, so we can go with an age around **12-13 years** for him… I doubt he was on the ship himself, since he came to the US “when he was young” … also, I checked the passenger list for the name Kowalski, there was nothing. But I’m pretty sure it had an effect on him, as well as the rest of our goldhearted group … maybe this was one occasion that made him realize how important it was to make people happy … since one can never know about tomorrow.

Credence, according to HP wiki, was born between 1897 and 1905, so the youngest he can be is 21 … if we set him being max. 24, he may have been **7-11** when the Titanic sank, old enough to understand what happened (despite not necessairly feeling the gravity of it most adults would). I wonder if the Second Salemers maybe decided to collect money for the victims … they are a religious organisation after all, it would make sense …

Jo spent time in Paris for a year of study, and Portugal as an interpreter in the early 90s...so perhaps, just maybe, Jo may take the opportunity of the Fantastic Beasts films to revisit some of the places she's been to, or even places she's always wanted to visit!

Its already known that leta never really fitted in at school and was an outsider. It also just so happens that the one person who seems to have understood her was newt, who has an affinity with magical beasts.

Though we will see Theseus and Jacob together for the first time in the next movie, there is a chance they’ve met before…

We know that Jacob fought in France during WWI, while the places of the incidents that made Theseus a war hero are still unknown.

Also, Jacob’s brother died in the war … there is a deleted scene in which he reveals this to Queenie…(I haven’t found it, though … does anyone know the specific dialogue?).

If we put these two pieces together - there is the chance of Theseus having saved a greater group of soldiers at one point, Jacob included, while not being able to save others … his brother being among the latter.

Jacob’s mind must have been erased, of course, but … maybe he gets some fragments back or dreams as Credence did… or maybe Queenie tries to help him remember and unwillingly confronts him with his most traumatizing experience during the war.

If they really did meet this way, I’m pretty sure, since Jacob is the way he is, he’s going to understand that Theseus had no choice… and that latter is going to tell him exaclty that, though probably revealing conflict over it… maybe even saying something like “They’ve been calling me a hero - year after year, every day, all the time … but the ones I couldn’t save remain dead.”

What do you think? Could Theseus and Jacob have met, even at this very point, or does this draw too many lines between the characters?

Maybe Grindelwald’s followers swat the Circus to ferret out Credence, or …

… he is their **tool** for the attack.

Considering his past and how his obscurus can be triggered - if one of them got close enough either during the performance (if he takes part at all, it’s still just a theory) or outside of it, and used, for example or even specificly, **a legilimency spell**.

We’ve seen Harry being subjected to this magic before … making him relive memories, very painfull ones included …

This charm would trigger Credence obscurus pretty effortlessly, and the followers could simply dissaparate as it broke loose…

Also, since Grindelwald himself is accordingly a gifted occlumens, he should know that this spell exists - he may have even taught it to a few of his followers along with occlumency…

_________________________________________________________________________


I couldn’t find any info on when exactly Dumbledore became head of House Gryffindor (he accordingly had this post when Tom Riddle was in his fifth year) and that Theseus was sorted into this house is only (very) likely, but if these two points are true, they may have a history of their own…

Theseus is usually described as very ambitious, “commanding” and on his way to becoming an outstanding auror, so we can assume he became prefect in his fifth year… and even before that, he may have been one of Dumbledore’s favorite students due to his skill and good heart (remember, during WWI, he was one of the wizards who actively defied the ministry’s orders and supported/saved muggle citizens).

We know that the Heads of the Houses know their students best and are people of trust to them … not to mention that Dumbledore may have been left with informing Theseus whenever his brother had gotten into serious trouble/been injured… maybe they became accustomed to these conversations (XD).

Remember, Dumbledore said “Newt is not a great follower of orders” and then likely smiled at Theseus :)

I have a headcannon that after the interrogation in this scene, Theseus stays behind as the other aurors leave and urgently asks Dumbledore to not to send his brother furtherly into the war against Grindelwald… maybe stressing that through his capture and imprisonment in America, him and Tina Goldstein are now strongly being targeted by his followers…

Of course he can’t change his mind, but Dumbledore will take his concerns serious, maybe even explain that there is not as much reason to worry for his brother as he may think (though that’s clearly debatable…)

In the next movie, as I said before, Newt may be tested if he is willing to object all orders for the (true) greater good… and I’m pretty convinced that Tina will face a similar journey … (warning: a lot of discussing Circus Arcanus in the middle)…  enjoy 😊

Whether or not I’m right about that she travels to Paris with Queenie to find Credence, there’s no doubt that once she knows he’s in the city, she’ll stop at nothing to contact him. Though he may mistrust her due to the past events, there is no way she will give up on him, or obey any law once he’s under her protection. 

But this will not be the only obstacle…

_______________________________________________________-


**Circus Arcanus**

We know she starts working with Yusuf Kama while in Paris, and they visit Circus Arcanus together – which will have an impact on her. We know Tina’s relation to humans … how will she react to whatever his happening to the freaks in the show?

We’ve seen her face briefly during the first look – a disturbed expression in the middle of a pretty loud audience.

Kama seemed a little stunned as well when getting a view … whatever the circus presents, it doesn’t apply well to some people.

I do wonder what they see… actual freak shows, sadly, often featured staff purposely injuring the presented humans for entertainment … but how does that work with the people in this circus? Maledictus is advertised as “enchanting snake-girl”, suggesting that she is going to dance rather than get hurt… the advertised “Oni” could suffer for this kind of show… and we know about a character named “Melusine” now, who could be a sort of waterfairy/shape-shifting mermaid, who is presented to the audience and forced to swim around in a tank/do tricks… maybe shortly lifted out of the water magically for the audience to get a better view… which likely is not going to react enchanted to all that is shown.

I still wonder how Credence fits into all of this … he is likely more informed about his condition now, and has survived an attack by several aurors (though not necessarily) without a single scratch. How can he be controlled? What is his part in the show?

They can’t show his face while performing, since his survival may be passed on to the MACUSA, so may perform invisibly, lifting the performers up and showing them around. While staying in the show for alike reasons.

I’m pretty convinced most of the freaks left or were given to the circus by their families, and suffer from a magical condition that makes it impossible for them to lead a normal life, which may be something they tell Tina when she tries to talk to them about their life. Also, they most likely have formed close relationships with each other over time.

Though Credence would have a chance if he got a wand and was allowed to practise/lower his magic, I’m sure he cannot leave the circus just like that either, partly because for having nowhere to go as well and partly for not wanting to leave Maledictus behind.  

I kind of have the feeling that Skender knows neither him nor the the others are going to leave on their own accord, and abuses this fact – though he cannot mistreat him too badly out of fear of another obscurial outbreak… my point is, considering that the people at the circus could have legit reasons to stay, he wouldn’t have to break the law and put an imperius curse on them.

Though what is happening in this circus is, I’m convinced, anything but human and Tina is going to remember it. In the end, I don’t think she will end the circus entirely – but Skender’s rule over it.

She may fight him alongside Creed and Maledictus, or maybe all alone 😊 and hand him over to authorities (maybe he has some secrets that lead to a prison sentence of a few years) before leaving the circus’ remaining staff (after the leaked attack scene) with carrying on with the show the way they feel comfortable – and staying together.

But we may see another situation with other horrors Tina has to face.

_______________________________________________________________________________________


**The Brothel**

In the list linked on “The Leaky Cauldron” about future scenes, a scenerie involving prostitutes was mentioned – which brings me back to the possibility of an imperius curse being used to keep people in check.

Unfortunately, it is very possible that some wizards use this curse to force magic and non-magic people into prostitution … and as we know, Barty Crouch was subdued to this curse and noone was able to tell.

Whyever the go to a brothel possibly run by such a wizard, Tina may react in a similar way as to the freak show – though this time this may actually end in her freeing all the captives.

I still have to wrap my mind around what role the brothel could play in this story – but it could be used to show another step in Tina’s journey, maybe one in which she actively fight an oppressor once again.

So, all in all, Tina may get the chance to stand up for others once again. I’m not sure if she will break the law/statute of secrecy again, but if she does… maybe she’ll stop minding.

The MACUSA may decide that her spirit can be of great use in the upcoming war. And if they do fire her … maybe the british ministry will :)

1772,RedSiren2,1524774018,"Hi there :)

A pretty long while ago, I made a theory on how the engagement between Leta and Theseus may have come to be … I remain with that she may have forced him to this magically , but there’s also a chance it happened solely on a human level … so enjoy :)

___________________________________________________________________________


**Theseus’ reasons**

Considering the appearently small age difference between Leta, Newt and Theseus, we can assume they spend most of their years at Hogwarts together … we know that Leta and Newt had a very close relationship, but Theseus’ part in it hasn’t been explained yet…

I wonder if he maybe fell in love with her sooner or later, but decided to keep these feelings to himself for his brother’s sake, who he knew shared them … after his expulsion and their graduation from Hogwarts, they may have stayed in contact … which she accordingly isn’t with Newt.

He stated himself their friendship ended years ago … but Theseus must know it scarred him, especially concerning that he didn’t have many friends, if at all… certainly noone who understood him the way she did (a kindred spirit).

It’s just not right to date a woman who has hurt your brother like this, unless your feelings are just too overwhelming (which still doesn’t quite make it right) … or **if you think he’s gotten over it.**

I think it would be pretty unlike the MACUSA to leave Newt unattended after the incidents of New York… and Tina has helped him before, they don’t quite trust her on that any longer, I’m sure…

So, if we assume they have been followed to the harbour by an auror who saw the tender moments they shared… and this scene **was sent as a memory to Britain** among other evidence concerning Newt’s case (or maybe by an auror who knew Theseus personally and thought this might interest him) he may have assumed Newt was moving on.

Maybe he even had a talk with his brother that made it clear to him that there was something happening here … of course, Newt probably didn’t tell him that he was still not quite over Leta (because who would).

So, after Newt’s return to England, Theseus may have started to ask Leta out… which could have led to a dispute between the brothers eventually, maybe even a pause in contact at all for a while … and then the proposal followed.

Considering this, we can assume their relationship will be quite tense by the start of “The Crimes of Grindelwald”.

_______________________________________________________________________


**Leta’s reasons**

If we consider that Theseus saw the scenerie between Newt and Tina … could Leta have found out about it as well?

We can assume that she was in contact with Theseus by this time… and considering the relationship he has to his brother, he certainly told her about this small surprise following the events of New York, maybe even a conversation they had.

How could she have felt about this?

__________________________________________


**Vengance (just one option)**

I wish I didn’t have to antagonize her character like this already … but one reason why she started to date Theseus could be that she felt betrayed.

Leta has been described as “confused” and “damaged” so far, and we musn’t forget that she had troubles fitting in at school as well - she was “misunderstood”, likely as much as Newt was … it’s sad, but possible that she couldn’t accept him being with somebody else. Maybe she didn’t believe, considering his issues with forming new relationships, that he would ever find a match again.

Her accepting to date Theseus and his proposal may be a confused act of revenge … in a way claiming someone he holds dear for herself.

(I will need more ideas for why she would date his brother freely considering the relationship they had at school… )

__________________________________________


**Good intentions?**

A more positive reason could be that she knows Grindelwald’s followers are targeting Theseus, in his new position as head of the auror’s department more than ever…  and that she is convinced he will be defeated. So, knowing about his feelings for her and their history, she wants to make his “final years”, as she thinks, joyful, even if it means she’ll have to hurt Newt.

Or maybe she is a follower of Grindelwald after all, and was told to lure Theseus into a relationship … which of course doesn’t mean that she can’t be a double agent, arranging his suvival at least and distracting him from his course … she’s “damaged” after all… if she pretends to need a lot of help and attention, and he can only put half his energy into his job, he may be considered less of a threat …

Anyway, I can’t wait to hear what stood behind this engagement … and for a scene where it may be Queenie who uncovers it :)

Please let me know if you have other ideas concerning this case :)

Hi there :)

In a previous theory, I stated that Queenie may have seen a vision in Grindelwald’s mind while he visited the Goldstein’s apartment … one that led her and Tina to travel to Paris to stop a desaster and/or find Credence.

But there could be a specific reason why he would let her see a hint to where latter might be… enjoy :)

_____________________________________________________________


**At any cost**

We know that, before and during the incidents of New York, Tina has shown herself to be determined to protect Credence… through his time at MACUSA, Grindelwald must have found out how and why she lost her job, and maybe even more details on her strong urge to protect humans in general…

So, if she heard that he planned to use Credence for his own plans/force him into obedience, and where he might be, she would stop at nothing to save him… Queenie, not only out of loyalty to her sister but also compassion for the boy would accompany her, of course - also for having seen Grindelwald’s mind and maybe being able to interpret his visions/plans differently… they both would go to Paris and find Credence through the information the have. And here we get to the plan.

And to Grindelwald’s talent to manipulate.


_________________________________________________________________


**Unconcious henchmen**

One thing I realized early when writing theories on the FB sequel is that Grindelwald right now doesn’t have much time to, for example, hunt Newt and Tina down, or order someone …. he has to gather followers, plan scemes against the magical and muggle community and structure the new order he desires … and his followers probably are very occupied as well, at least those capable enough to face them, or Credence… also, none of them are known to latter in person…

My theory is that he purposely feeds Tina and Queenie the vision of Credence’ possible wherabouts and lets their urge to protect him do the rest… he may have some of his followers spy on them once in a while, but elsewhat, he lets them work… for him. Until their mission is completed. He may even have hope that Credence will join them without hesitation (which is debatable).

So, the sisters, soonly joined by Newt and Jacob, may be played to do the work for Grindelwald and his followers.

when you run outside to look for something and suddenly there’s a random “click”…

There could be another reason to why Queenie looks so worried on most of the photos we’ve seen from “The Crimes of Grindelwald” … enjoy 😊

__________________________________________________________________________________________


**The first look (literally)**

During the sneak peek shown in Orlando, we saw, among other clips, Grindelwald walking around in the Goldstein’s apartment … but what was he doing there? And what does it have to do with Queenie?

For this we will have to combine their gifts – according to JK Rowling, Grindelwald is a **seer**, and has frequent visions he can recall… Queenie is a **Legilimence**…


**What if she saw something inside his mind that terrified her?**


It could be a vision he had of the future, or just the plans he has … maybe even a specific mission in Paris?


The question is if he knows about her powers, or what she saw/if he finds out about it during this scene … or if he tricks her into following a convincingly alarming, but false trail? Is this the reason why he came to their apartment?

Maybe she went to Paris with Tina to stop him from what he is planning … I wonder, is this a secret mission? And why? We know Tina meets with Yusuf Kama, who currently working with the line of sucession of Corvus Lestrange… (and who, maybe through his niece (?) is more likely to protect Credence)

Do **they** write to Newt to ask for his help (or write much as they can tell him,in case somebody steals the postcard)?

Considering this, does Jacob know? Remember:

*“Are you going somewhere?”*

*“No, we’re going somewhere!”*

Sounds like a conflict is emerging … maybe Jacob feeling like a burden and Newt being convinced that he can be of use, while Tina and Queenie, especially latter, are worried for his safety…

But getting back to topic, what could Grindelwald plan in Paris? Does he plan to bring destruction and despair to one of the most populated cities in Europe, try reveal the wizarding world … or does it have something to do with **Nicolas Flamel?**

Or maybe with **Credence**, after all?

____________________________________________________________________________


**Together in Paris**

Could the reason why to Tina and Queenie are working without authorities, form an alliance with Yusuf Kama and call Newt from England be that Grindelwald **specificly targets Credence** for his cause? They will be the two “main players” of the next movie, after all…

But how did they know he would be in Paris?

Could that be what Queenie saw? A not entirely clear vision, but significant still? Or did she see several visions Grindelwald had?

I’d like to hear some thoughts on that :)

There is a chance that Credence will probably have a hard time trusting Tina in the upcoming movie … but unfortunately, it likely won’t be just her… 

Hope I can sum up all the possible reasons, enjoy 😊


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________



**Authority issues**

Ever since his near death by the hand of the aurors of MACUSA, Credence certainly holds a grudge against the wizarding administration in America … not only because of the attack, but also for their failure in finding him in years. He may have heard that children in non-magic families can be detected by authorities – though he may find that since he successfully surpressed his magic for years, they may not be responsible … nor for not noticing Grindelwald’s infiltration, though there is a chance that he believes they secretly collide with him (which I wouldn’t put past either).

Also, through the attack, he may have problems trusting authorities in general now – though this is not unfounded. Credence has endangered the secrecy of the wizarding world, killed three no-majes and was proven to be almost impossible to control… he must know the International Wizarding Police will try to eliminate him at any cost. This was also supported by Skender in a deleted scene by the end of the first movie, who stressed that he’d face a capital punishment if he stayed in America.  

Grindelwald’s part during the last movie also certainly has added to his paranoia – no matter how conscious he was when the dark lord was arrested, the story must have circled through magic newspapers everywhere later on… how is he supposed to trust anyone’s face? Or anyone who offers his help, no matter how convincingly supportive?

These issues will also make it much harder for strangers like Jacob, Queenie or Theseus to approach him.

But the chance of someone tricking him these ways is only the beginning of his suspicions…


_________________________________________________________________________________________



**Official problems**

I’ve mentioned in a previous theory that Credence may not trust Tina any longer… when she tried to calm him down during the last movie, he was attacked and, at least briefly, severely injured … he may have misunderstood the situation and, especially now that she has joined the auror’s division once more, think that she seeks to deliver him to authorities upon gaining his trust. Even if Queenie managed to bring back the memory of how she protected him from Mary Lou – will he believe her intentions were good? Will he believe in this memory at all?

According to HP wiki, he had dreams of the incident after his obliviation... but does he believe them? Or believe them to be tricks?

Another almost similar problem occurs concerning Newt … during Credence journey through Europe with Circus Arcanus, “Fantastic Beast and where to find them” was published … whether he was in England at the right time or the book was translated quickly enough to be mentioned in a newspaper in another country (he’d need a translator for that, but why not – there may be many people from different countries at the Circus, and he certainly wants to keep himself informed, especially after Grindelwald’s escape) and he saw a photo of the man he’d met in New York, a whole new story may have formed in his head … and not a good one…

He knows Newt and Tina are friends … which may make him suspicious in his eyes already. But he may have read that Newt is working at the Beast division in the British ministry of magic … he may assume that he was sent to approach him in New York, as it is also increasingly public knowledge that he has an astounding talent with magical beasts, even highly dangerous ones such as dragons …  and Credence’ obscurus form comes undeniably close to this. He may have concluded that Newt has similar orders as Tina, hence why he would defend him against Grindelwald, or rather keeping him from recruting the boy … especially considering, which certainly was mentioned in a Newspaper, that he is the younger brother of a famous british auror.

He may also think, as a fellow tumblr user stated, that the two of them may plan to use his unique powers for their own purposes. Or maybe that the ministries seek to use him as a human weapon against Grindelwald, or to harvest his powers…

So, considering all this, the group is facing a solid wall of issues … how can they gain his trust? How can anyone even get him to listen?

Is there any way he can be convinced?


_________________________________________________________



Because frankly, I can’t wrap my mind around this yet. Maybe Leta will figure out a surprising way, maybe Maledictus will convince him to give them a chance

… or Newt and Tina simply free all the people and creatures from Circus Arcanus to show that they value life over law. But that’s just my headcannon :)

First off, lets recapitulate what this spell has done.  We first see a big mass of white light crash into the ground and rebunce off of it, propelling itself towards the aurors.

I think this spell is a patronus and the reasons might sound rediculus, but bear with me on this one.

First off, I am considering the fact that it is David Yates who is back after having directed films 4 - 7.  In film 5, (please consider I have read all 7 books at least 5000 times each but I am going with information from the movie since it is the FB format) when the DA are practicing patronuses, there is a dog that makes Neville fall onto the ground.  Already, whe can say that in the movies, the patronus have impact on physical objects.  Secondly, (still sticking to the films) almost every time the patronus spell is used, it has brought something new with it.  In HPPA, its is first seen as a shield then as an animal.  In HPDH it can transport messages, then split up in three, and (movie) make a big defensife bubble protecting the school against dementores.  What I am trying to show, is that the spell has evolved into multiple formats throughout the series, so after all, why shouldnt the spell have a more distructive version.

Finally, I would like to include the pottermore page on patronus;

‘It is my firm belief that such a Patronus is an indicator of obsession or eccentricity. Here is a wizard who may not be able to hide their essential self in common life, who may, indeed, parade tendencies that others might prefer to conceal. Whatever the form of their Patronus, you would be well-advised to show respect, and occasionally caution, towards a witch or wizard who produces the patronus of their choice.’

Really the meaningful information is the last bit where it says ""wizard who produces the patronus of their choice.""  If I understood, some powerful wizards can change the forme of their patronus.  So far this only approves my theory that Grindelwald killed five aurors with the patronus charm.

So what do you think?  Could it be a patronus or am I forgetting a bit of knowledge that could debunk it?",FantasticBeasts,Grindelwald's spell at the begining of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/8d5mqo/grindelwalds_spell_at_the_begining_of_fantastic/,1524029524.0

While thinking about Newt’s escape and plot for the next movie, I had an idea… just an assumption, but it would fit into the story and with some things we’ve seen during the trailer.

We know that Newt is called to France in the next movie by someone we don’t know – it was said before that Leta is send after him by Dumbledore to get him to come back, and that he has a talk with his old teacher, apparently by the beginning of the sequel, concerning Grindelwald – and probably before he gets the ominous postcard from Paris …

Newt’s plot will only be a side story for the next movie as the “main players” are going to be Credence and Grindelwald … so what happens to him?


What if he is … **tested?**

_______________________________________________________________________


**Where to turn**

We know he is told by Dumbledore that he needs his help … but then receives a postcard and travels straight to Paris, despite Dumbledore’s orders (I think this might be true), despite his pending travel permission. On the card we see during the trailer a significant letter stands out … some say an L, some an A … or maybe a part of an N?

Did he receive a card from Nicolas Flamel… with a plea so urgent he just had to act?

And here we get to the test.

Dumbledore and Flamel are friends, accordingly … so if they are by this time Dumbledore asked for his help, maybe even his active assistance in a plan he had, he’d likely do it.


**But what is Newt to prove?**


For this we will have to look at Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince – and the orders Dumbledore gives to Harry in the book, specifically **to hide if he tells him to, or to leave him behind and save himself when he orders him.**

Dumbledore thinks about a greater good, if you will – and he may want to test if Newt **is willing and able to select it and act for the greater course** when the time comes.

And as far as I can tell – he is. He defies the ministry and also Dumbledore to do what is necessary, leaves Britain flawlessly and most likely reaches Flamel to help – and then to hear that he has passed. Maybe even to meet Dumbledore at the Flamel’s house for a glass of wine to celebrate, and a joke about the first great exam by a Hogwarts teacher he ever had … but that’s just my headcannon. 

___________________________________________________


It also goes well with two quotes we hear during the trailer.

*“… Newt is not a great follower of orders.” (smiles)*

*“The time’s coming Newt - when you’re gonna have to pick a side.”*

So, what do you think? Could this be one of the loyalties being tested during the sequel, in an unexpected way? Please let me know :)

1783,jsm02,1522946134,"Please note: This is not a critique of any of the Harry Potter movies, simply a suggestion for the future of the Fantastic Beasts series.
David Yates was the fourth in a line of directors for the Harry Potter movies. He was also the last new director for the series. And while Order of the Phoenix was good, I think it’s unfortunate that they didn’t continue letting new directors take on the next two movies. It made 5-7 all feel tonally pretty similar to each other, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it just makes the individual movies less interesting. But what’s done is done, and I’m more interested in the future of the franchise. David Yates signed on to direct the first Fantastic Beasts, and, unsurprisingly, the visuals and tone of that movie felt very similar to his 3 Harry Potter movies. And from the looks of the trailer, The Crimes of Grindelwald will be the same. This was disappointing to me, because I was hoping for something really unique that set itself apart from the Harry Potter series, and instead we got pretty much the same old thing. So while they’ve failed to establish a new, interesting style for these first two movies, it’s not too late to fix it for the next two. If they can drop Yates and hire a new director, I believe it will breathe some much-needed life into the series, and maybe make it more enjoyable to watch two more movies in this series. Otherwise, I think it’s going to get old fast.",FantasticBeasts,It’s Time for David Yates to Step Down,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/8a17y1/its_time_for_david_yates_to_step_down/,1522917334.0
1786,RedSiren2,1522865246,"Hi there :) 

I recently realized something that blew my mind a little … 

Shortly before Credence turns into his black obscurus form again/starts to regenerate (while climbing out of the destroyed subway tunnel) he appears **significantly red** - the same red as the **philosopher's stone** … shortly after, he recrates his entire body.

Appearently the obscurus has **the power of regeneration…** and here we get to Flamel.

Nicolas Flamel was accordingly **the only wizard** who was able to create a philosopher’s stone - but how he did this was never explained.

* Is he a former Obscurial? Was he healed by starting to practise magic in time, maybe left with a small version of the Obscurus always to remain, and used it? During the new trailer, we see Credence releasing obscurial magic through his hand (not to mention that he is wearing **a red shirt** for this movie…) which could be the key to how a stone can be created… 

* Did he study obscurials? Did he meet one and used him to create his stone? (this would be dark… )

There is a chance that Obscurials and the elixir of life are connected … if the stone is made out of solid, pure magic, it would also explain how it can turn any metal into gold … it’s appearently not possible/legal for wizards, but maybe the french government came to an arrangement with Mr. Flamel …

And by the next movie, Credence and him are in the same city. Coincedence? Non!

I still got to find more clues, but … there are too many connections…

Anyway, please tell me what you think about this :)

Corvus line seems to not let me go any time soon … the following theory contains one option that I definiftly don’t want to be true, but that’s just my personal opinion. Though by the end, I think I really discovered something very interesting this time :)

Enjoy 😊

_________________________________________________


We know now that the line of Corvus Lestrange the fathers passed on the first name to the next male in line (and by chance so far never had more children once there was a son). 

http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Lestrange_family

_______________________________________________


**A prophecy?**

Corvus means “raven” … we are currently at Nr. 5, but a popular number especially concernig a number of ravens in stories is seven - maybe there even is a prophecy about the first Corvus that states the 7th heir in this line will blessed in a way … and they maybe thought “son” immediately (we’ll get to that later).

Credence is 5… unless his father had two other sons born before him… that maybe weren’t legitimized, but still existed… and here we get to the big “Nooooo….” in my head… the fact that we only know about Newt and Theseus’ mother so far. 


________________________________________________________


**Lost ravens?**

We can assume that Leta was born around the same time as Newt… but that doesn’t make it unrealistic that her father had an affair during his marriage/engagement… maybe to ensure he’d have a son, so his family would be content… but either

* to legitimate the child/children with his family was more difficult than he had expected
* he decided to stay with his wife until the sons would be old enough to tell them about their heritage

What kept him from Nr. 7 so long is still debatable… maybe he was satisfied after 5 and was going to let him carry on the line, 6 still happened, maybe he did like Mrs. Scamander (I wonder if she was married… before, while or after she met him) … and then he met Clarisse Tremblay and fell in love.

As I said, I really don’t want this to be true, because it connect the characters way too much, and overdues the “Lost sibling” theme, especially since we already have that during the series so far… though that’s just my opinion.

______________________________________________


**But…**

… this theory contains **another option.**

Let’s get back to the chance of a prophecy about seven ravens… and assume the Lestranges were wrong about thinking the heir had to be **male.**

I guess you were thinking the same while looking at the family tree :) I counted myself to see if someone else could be the seventh raven already ... and (I've posted the family tree with numbers) there is :)

That’s right. If we count the women in, **Leta is the true seventh raven.**

Of course I’m bonkers all over the place again… but it seems to add up…

1794,RedSiren2,1522182992,"Previously, I talked with a fellow Tumblr user about why it seems that an entire squad of aurors is eager to get Newt back to Britain after his escape…

I think for the most part, they came to Hogwarts to ask for Dumbledores help concerning Grindelwald’s escape (remember, he is known to be very intelligent and powerfull, and until Tom Riddel asked for the post of the teacher for defense against the dark arts, he had been offered the most of minister of magic three times - not to mention that they refer to Newt working under “his orders” (how exactly did they know that?).

But there are reason why they need to get Newt back home … so enjoy :)

___________________________________________


**1. Family bonds**

The one to put the most effort into this mission is likely his brother Theseus. The relationship between Newt and his brother has always been described as “tentiavely warm” despite their differences… through the letter Theseus send him during the first movie and the scene by the end of the first TCOG trailer, we could see they are close, as far as I can tell … even though they may have some issues at the moment through Theseus’ engagement.

I believe even before Grindelwald’s escape, Newt may have been targeted by his followers … his brother is known as “very powerfull”, a “war hero”, joined the hunt for Grindelwald and currently works in the department for magical law enforcement at the ministry. He correspoded with Percival Graves during the incidents of New York, and according to HP wiki, he is head of the auror’s deparment.

(http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror_Department )

I think people have faith in that he is more than capable of fighting Grindelwald and his followers… maybe american wizards used to believe in Percival Graves the same way …

Conclusion: it would make sense for Grindelwald to capture his brother and blackmail/mentally abuse him with this, to maybe lure Theseus to a trap - or simply to kill Newt and let him live with the fact that he couldn’t save him.

That’s a truly evil villian … he selects those who the commoner believes in and shows him that they can be defeated.

So far, we only know about one other biological family member of Theseus, which is his mother… either she is magically very well-protected or Newt has become the main target through Grindelwald’s capture… or his followers do try to abduct her and we will still get to see that :)

All in all, he would be safer in Britain with the ministry, his brother and Dumbledore close enough, especially in London… or at least within the country.

___________________________________________


**2. A necessairy evil**

JK Rowling has stated that throughout the next movie we will learn why Newt was allowed to keep his wand and work at the ministry … my conclusion is that even before he published his book, he was known for his talent with magical creatures and his astounding knowledge… a confident programme by the ministry in WWI involving Ukrainian Ironbellys has been mentioned in his biography on HP wiki… http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Newton_Scamander

We know that during the time of Harry Potter, wizards are sucessfully working with dragons in Romania… but it seems that during this time, there weren’t many people who they’d respond to.

So, we know he is special in his own way, that Dumbledore has faith in him (he accordingly sees him as a kindred spirit), and that his skills are widely known, especially after he publishes his book … we also get a small hint on his history of not always obeying the law during his short talk with the minister (of foreign affairs) during the first movie.

*“… and what are you doing in New York?”

“I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskin, sir.”

“Right. What are you really doing here?”*

Notice how the minister goes from relaxed to a little strict to friendlily not buying the lie… almost like Newt has lied straight to his face many times before, but he knows there can’t be anything too sinister behind it.

Conclusion: the ministry knows Newt can and will break the law when it comes to magical beasts, but they avoid too active restrainment of his actions since 1. noone wants to actively cross neither Dumbledore nor Theseus and 2. they know he is a valuable mind and that his work throughout his life will improve the life of magical creatures worldwide and the knowledge about them. 

Not to mention that they may hope for his help during the war against Grindelwald.

Also, some may fear (though unfounded) that if they actively turned on him/fractured his sanity, he may offer his skills to the dark side (remember, this man knows how to train dragons).

1797,RedSiren2,1522141776,"Hi there :)
It's been a while since I wrote a theory this long... let's get started right away this time :)

_______________________________________


When Leta is watching her mother dancing (I’m out of other options for this scene) we see an interesting picture…

In the background we see two couples talking… and a single young, skinny man with rather dark hair… looking down at his champagne glass shyly, not at the dancer… kind of resembling Credence…

This could be Corvus… could be. We will need more info on his character first … after all, he was from a wealthy pureblood family and married twice… that doesn’t mean he cannot possibly be shy, of course… but this young mans look makes me wonder… about an arranged marriage perhaps?

And there could be a reason… 

____________________________________


**Empty golden hands**

In HP 4, it was mentioned that the Gaunts lived in poverty since the family gold had been wasted generations ago… maybe a similar problem occured to a line of the Lestranges, maybe several… we know of course that Bellatrix was rich, but so was Narcissa likely …  considering that the Black family was wealthy even by Sirius generation, Rodolphus may have been living off his wife’s fortune… who married him for his blood… I wonder from which part of the Lestrange family he is :)

We know for a fact that the Lestranges are famous in a way… but maybe they were facing financial issues at the time and eager to marry their children off to wealthier families, which eventually saved them… one of them may have been the **Kama family**.

If you look at the man walking past behind Leta, more specificly his top head visible through her feather headdress, you can see he is pretty bald… is this **Corvus III**, walking over to his son? I say yes.

________________________________


**“And then … “**

But the story doesn’t stop here, of course… can you sense it as well?

Let’s assume he spent around 8 years in the marriage with Laurena… a friendly relationship, a daughter, a solid, wealthy life, his family satisfied… and then Clarisse appeared.

Remember how Mary Lou said she was a “wicked, unnatural woman” ?

Maybe the Lestranges shared this opinion.

They met in Britain or France, fell in love…  escaped to New York and married.

Imagine someone explaining this to Credence in the following manner:


*“It’s funny … you ran off and met a woman… your father met a woman and ran off.”*


Appearently they still named their son Corvus V… he maybe didn’t want to break with all of his family traditions, or Clarisse just liked this name … or another reason. One of them leaving/dying could be one… if he died, she may have named him after his father as Merope Gaunt did, if she did, this may have been the only one he could think of… this could also explain why he left his child with someone else… he couldn’t bear to look at her living memory.

So he left him in the care of the Second Salemers. I think Leta is not the only “none-giver” in this story… we may get a pretty layered character.

The story of Corvus and Clarisse after 1905 by the latest is still very vague… according to the family tree, neither of them had more children afterwards… of course that doesn’t mean anything, but that’s all we get on them. Grindelwald stated Clarisse was dead, Mary Lou said she “was” as she said, but still… can we believe them?

Anyway, that’s all I got so far. Did I miss anything?

Thank you very much for reading anyway:)

So far, a curious number of memory scenes has been confirmed for the Crimes of Grindelwald …

- **Young Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Ariana** (return of Jaime Campbell Bower?)

- **Newt, Leta and “Sebastian”** (the infamous incident in which likely latter was almost killed by a Jarvey, for which Newt took the blame for his friend)

- The scene where **Sabine Crossen aka “Mrs. Lestrange”** appears (I believe she is going to be **Clarisse Lestrange nee Tremblay**, Credence mother, and as she is around the age of Eddie Redmayne, we can assume it’s going to be a memory

- The scene Leta is watching during the Trailer, in which a dark-skinned woman, maybe **Isaura Barbe-Brown** aka **Laurena Lestrange nee Kama**, her mother, dancing … 

__________


The question is : **Who sees these memories? And where?**


_________________


**The pensieve**


The first one could be seen by Dumbledore in his pensieve at Hogwarts, or by Grindelwald … or maybe someone shows this memory to Credence, maybe latter, to further explain his condition/power?

The pensieve part is important… we know Dumbledore’s is at Hogwarts (if it is, **maybe he only receives it during this movie?**). 

Leta is likely in a pensieve during her scene, but not in England… her outfit is different from the one she wears at Hogwarts, and since it’s pretty fancy, she may be in Paris already. 

_____________________________


**Legilimence**

As we know, Queenie can use her legilimence to watch memories that a person is currently recalling… it would be interesting to see a situation like this from her perspective :). As she explained before, it is easier when a person is hurt (which could happen… it was explained this movie is more of a thriller… )

… or maybe she watches a dream while staying at Newt’s suitcase?

Another way would be a **legilimence jinx**, which of course can give a wizard acess to every memory he desires if his victim is defenseless…

Both mentioned ways could work on Newt, since I think Dumbledore could be prepared for such an invasion or at least have the knowledge … Newt of course could be able to close his mind too, as I wouldn’t put it past that he endured this jinx before in other countries while being interrogated… the question is if he only didn’t use it on Queenie to not to be harsh to his new friend (remeber, he doesn’t have many), if he was just unable to since, as she explained, entering a mind is easier when the person is hurt, or if he really doesn’t know how …

Credence most likely doesn’t. We don’t know when Mary Lou adopted him… but I think even a very young infant has memories of his mother that just can’t be recalled… unless one uses the Legilimence jinx, of course.

Anyway, we’re going to dive into memories :) Looking foward to that :)

Alright, with the first trailer to ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" came a scandalous family tree of the Lestrange family ... which was screenshotted and analyzed by fans already :) All photos can be found on the internet, the family tree can be found on the Harry Potter Wiki :)

I’ll try to sum up what the fans have collected on Tumblr so far on **Leta’s and Credence cojoined family history** (where did that come from XD)

(It’s party assumption, I’m gonna mark that)

Enjoy :)

____________________________________________________________________

**Corvus Lestrange IV** (according to the names of his mother, grandmother and great-grandmother a french wizard (http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Heloise_Beaufort) married **Laurena Kama**, a french witch who had a brother or cousin, **Yusuf Kama** (who is 51, so he’s in the Fantastic Beasts parent generation - a relative only likely, we haven’t heard the story itself yet).

He appearently went to Britain with his wife and had a daughter, **Leta**, who went to Hogwarts. She’s roughly 10 years older than her half-brother (who was born **1905** by the latest), and it’s likely Corvus left the family when she was 8 or older, likely before she went to Hogwarts.

(This is a possible explaination for why she didn’t fit it at school… no doubt she was one of a kind, but she also had practically lost her father and was maybe depressed - wait, Newt’s father is hasn’t been mentioned so far… maybe this is how their friendship started - they understood each other for several reasons (!) just an assumption, but why not?))

Anyway, Corvus met **Clarisse Tremblay** (played by french-american actress Sabine Crossen, this heritage is no coincidence) either in Britain or France, and married her… after this, his story ends for us. We don’t know whether he went back to Britain, stayed in America or went somewhere else… neither if he’s in contact with Leta. I mean, they could write each other… he’d still be gone and leave his daughter missing him, but they could have this …

Clarisse had a son… who was named **Corvus Lestrange V.** Either Corvus was still present when he was born or she named him after his father who had wanted this.

And then something happened. Corvus left/died, and something happened to Clarisse… and their child was adopted by someone who knew Clarisse and explained she was “wicked and unnatural” - **Mary Lou Barebone**. She adopted the boy and renamed him **Credence**. We don’t know if his mother really is, as Grindelwald stated,  dead or what happened to his father.

This is only what I have so far… what do you think? Did I miss something?

**Newt Scamander missing - public support required**

The magic ministry in London announced yesterday that the magizoologist and author of the educational book “Fantastic Beasts and where to find them”, Newt Scamander, has been reported to be missing by relatives.

Authorities are investigating and stated that they mostly exclude the possibility of a crime. A speaker of the department for magical law enforcement declared that for reasons not furtherly explained due to the protection of data privacy, Mr. Scamander’s permission to travel had recently been rejected by authorities as “pending”, to which he had accordingly reacted displeased.

“We have been informed by a confident source that he has most likely left the country… according to rumours we must go after, to Paris. His apartment in London has been searched thoroughly… furniture and personal items were still in place, so we assume, though he is known to live in a suitcase jinxed with an undetectable spreading spell most of the time, he will return eventually… and soon after explain himself in court.”

The department of magical law enforcement requires the help of the public to find Mr. Scamander – if you plan a holiday or other journey to France, or should spot him in Britain or another country, please inform local authorities immediately. Do not try to speak to or capture Scamander yourself – he is known to be a probed duellist and escapist. A confident source has also informed authorities that a sign for Mr. Scamander being nearby is a sighting of a magical creature roaming a city or settlement unattended. Please inform authorities at sight.

1815,chmursonian,1520989100,"Please don't read this post if you haven't seen the newest FBAWTFT2 trailer, otherwise it's going to spoil a lot of things!

Ok, first of all in the trailer at exactly 1:15 we can see a man standing in front of a wall with lots of writings on it. Right in the middle there appears to be something that looks like a family tree with faces. From what I can see it looks roughly like this:


Corvus Lestrange (white face)
                                                     
Laurina Kama (black face, ♀)                                    Clarde?Tremblay (white face, ♀)
                                                                                                 
Leta Lestrange (black&amp;white face, ♀)                          Credence Barebomb (white face, ♂ )


First of all that would mean that Credence and Leta are siblings (their father is Corvus Lestrange who had two wives).  That would explain why Credence’s magic was so powerful in the first movie – he comes from a family of powerful wizards. I think that in the upcoming movie Leta might use the fact that they’re a family in order to manipulate Credence and use him to her advantage. In the first movie Queenie did say that Leta’s a “taker”.This would make sense since in the trailer we can see Leta and Credence sitting on a roof whilst Credence “releases”(?) his obscurus.

Now, moving onto the faces. At first I thought that maybe they indicted the level of a person’s pure-bloodness, but Lestranges always married pure-bloods and Leta is confirmed to be a pure-blood so that just doesn’t add up. BUT, this is the 20s and 30s we’re talking about – an era of segregation and I think the faces are supposed to symbolize race. This would mean that Laurina Kama (Leta’s mother) was a poc, making Leta mixed-race. This makes sense – Zoe Kravitz who plays Leta is also mixed-race (1/4 white from what I’ve found out). This might mean that the movie may tackle some racial issues, which considering movies that came out recently (e.g. Black Panther) wouldn’t be all that shocking.

Ok, so to sum up my theory is:

-Leta and Credence are sibilings

-Leta is going to play the family card in order to manipulate Credence

-Racial issues might be tackled

But this theory still leaves a lot of questions unanswered – why was Credence abandoned? Why did he grow up in America and not the UK? Please share your thoughts!

1833,RedSiren2,1518034398,"Hi there :)

I’ll be trying to sum up what we have on Grindelwald’s earliest backstory so far… hope you enjoy :)

First of all, Gellert Grindelwald was born in 1883. Next to nothing is known so far about his life before attending Durmstrang. Except for Bathilda Bagshot in England, none of his family members are ever adressed… yet we get some clues on his heritage.


_____________________


**Born in Switzerland?**

In the teaser trailer, he is wearing a **chavari** (the chain he wears to his vest, a traditional piece of jewellery in the german/swiss alpines) and leather pants - also pointing to that he may be from this region in Europe. Also, Grindelwald is the name of a community in the canton of Bern, Switzerland.

I’d like him to be swiss, actually… I can’t say I ever heard of a story’s villian being from this country, it’s a new idea :)

So, let’s assume he was born and raised in Switzerland… how was his family life?

_________________________________________________


**The Grindelwald family**

Considering his relation to pure-blood wizards and the fact that his parents were wealthy enough to send him half across the european continent to school (Durmstrang is said to be located in Norway/Sweden), we can assume they are a rich pureblood family… and the fact that they chose to send him to Durmstrang, a school known for specificly educating students in dark magic, and not to Beauxbatons (which is not only closer to his home country, but also would make more sense as he only would have to attend courses in french (an easy task in Switzerland) … suggests ties of his family to darker magic already existing.

A rich, pureblood family… with a tendency to dark magic and noone speaking out against the son going to school far away.

Not the most heartwarming tale of a childhood, I think. 

_____________________________________________________________________


**Education**

We know for a fact that he was expelled from Durmstrang for “twisted” experiments with dark magic… and that he is in no way a man of mercy.

The question is if he was born with a psychologic disposition that caused him to never be able to form actual relationships or feel anything for other humans, or if he experienced some sort of trauma … maybe concerning his parents.

He is said to have been extremely intelligent and charming (manipulative for sure), with a strong interest in the dark arts and magical artifacts… I wonder if he was mentally ahead of most of his fellow students. Maybe Durmstrang, maybe school in general didn’t give him enough challenge… this could explain his experiments as well as his history with Dumbledore… able to like someone or not, he must have been enjoying someone on the same intellectual level.

1847,RedSiren2,1515001658,"Hi there :)

I think that many FB fans have already been wondering about how Credence could become an Obscurial… or rather how he wasn’t found by ministry officials in New York.

If we look at this fact closer… many things don’t add up.

________________________________________________________


**1. Credence is very powerfull…** his magic, surpressed or not, must have shwon at a time… and since in Britain authorities are informed if magic is being practised somewhere, it would make sense if this was the case in the US as well. Even if he surpressed it, it doesn’t mean he couldn’t be found…

I don’t believe all children born magically express magic before they turn eleven, this would cause constant havoc in the muggleworld … Harry did, yet Neville for example didn’t until he was forced to, and the muggleborn throughout the story never mentioned anything happening before their birthday, at least nothing significant, yet they were found and informed…

Since Madame Picquery declared that “There is no obscurial in america” (remember these words!), there must be a system to find all young wizards and make sure they are educated. Also, if they really are no obscurials, that must mean they also take care of the muggleborn (though I wonder how concerning their law on none-magic people…)

**2. Ariana Dumbledore wasn’t found** though she was an Obscurial… I believe her parents and later her brother must have build up a sort of wall to hide her outbreaks from the ministry … yet it was known she existed. Only her powers were sucessfully kept secret.

But who kept Credence secret?

___________________________________________


As I said, even if Credence kept his powers secret and surpressed them… authorities must have found out he existed, if they can track down every young wizard in america **(especially one living nearby the MACUSA)**. Also, it’s almost impossible that he never showed any abilities… leave alone that he is extremely powerfull, but this would also be a reason for his adoptive mother to punish him (especially whipping his hands if she saw him conjuring with them).

Yet he was never found… no letter from Illvermorny, to authority coming around … how?
It begs the question…
Was this planned?

________________________________________________________

**Seraphina Picquery's role**

First of all, I don’t know if she was responsible for the entire case … I couldn’t find in which department she worked before her presidency, yet it may have been one in which she could work on a plan to create something… or do an experiment… including making sure that said experiment would not be noticed by those not meant to know when performing small (or increasing) amounts of magic... 

Credence was born around 1910, 10 years before she became president… yet if she had worked in a department where she was in a leading position already (which makes sense if she later on ran for president) she could have done something…

And her behaviour is **more than suspicious.**

___________________________________________


* When Newt claims an Obscurus killed Senator Shaw, she regrets this idea, stating “There is no obscurial in america” … slightly smiling… (much like Grindelwald when Newt says he’s not one of his fanatics) and has Newt and the others arrested immediatly.

* When the Obscurus breaks loose, she quietly orders her aurors to contain it to avoid the exposure of the wizardry world….

* She appears in person at it’s last stop… risking her life for no appearent reason… 

* When she meets Grindelwald, she reacts surprisingly calm… which makes me wonder … does he know about her plans?  **Is… that the reason he came to New York and infiltrated MACUSA?**

* In the end, she definitly saw a piece of Credence climbing away from the scene (following her eyes), and loudly, even a little slowly, said : **“We cannot obliviate an entire city!”**

_____________________________________________________________________


She definitly knows something. I wouldn’t put it past that she was part of a group, or even it’s leader, which planned to create a human weapon against dark wizards.
Maybe we’ll find out in the next movie… when she allegedly goes to Paris. If there is no appearent reason once again… we may get another clue.
Thank you very much for reading :)

This would also kind of explain why the **wizardry world** is said to become “devided and more dangerous” in the upcoming movie...

**Dumbledore** may attend as an advisor to the minister, though he isn’t that famous yet, I think he is known to be powerfull already…

Wait… does **Tina** come along as guard to **Seraphina Piquery?** Though she is a former outlaw, the president must know she is trustworthy and eager to do the right thing… will she represent the american law enforcement?

And **Torquil Travers** may either be a representative of Scotland or … the leader of the hunt for Grindelwald?

1858,RedSiren2,1514540879,"In a scene cut out from the end of the first FB movie, the **ringmaster of Circus Arcanus** already had an appearence. He met with Credence after he recovered from the attack by the MACUSA and offered him a job at Circus Arcanus. When he hesitated, Skender pointed out that his life was at stake in America, which led him to agree and join the circus headed to europe (on the same boat as Newt).

Skender is said to be a rather **ambigious** character… yet what does that mean for the next movie?

____________________________________

**Credence' new life**

So far, Credence seems healthy and has appearently made a friend in Maledictus … yet it kinda points out to me that on the moving picture in the trailer, **he is the only one not moving.**

What happened to him?

I believe he has him training him along with the other artists, his job being **lifting them up into the air** in Obscurus form (invisible) and **smashing through solid materials** as part of the show.

To keep his powers under control, Skender either


* arranged a wand for him to practise, to lower his magic to a safe level, yet strong enough for his performance

* has him training his performance on a regular basis - once he is exhausted and tired, he lets him rest until his power is high enough again to go into Obscurus form - which means he constantly goes back and forth between exhaustion and his magic rising to an uncomfortable level…

* has him training regularily, but never to exhaustion - this way Credence learns to go back and forth in his forms without bursting out and using his power safely. Since Credence is an important part of the show, SKender treats him friendlily, gaining his trust



The second option is the more dramatic, one where Credence would want to escape the circus and dream of a better life… but can’t since he’s got nowhere to go, still fears the MACUSA and most of all, can’t leave the slowly transforming Maledictus behind.

Yet the third one is more likely… a story where Credence is betrayed once more by someone he thought was going to help him would make sense… yet does Skender?

As I mentioned, Credence on the picture is not moving at all… along with his stern expression, this could mean that has learned to control his Obscurus and can use it at will now safely.

I think you alrealdy sense a bigger plan behind this…

______________________________________________________


**A deal with Grindelwald**

It is possible that Skender is a follower of Grindelwald, who (since this man has his ways) **got the order to train Credence …**
It would make sense… especially if Grindelwald hears that he is taking care of the boy. And after his breakout … he may visit the Circus to examine the result of Skender’s training.

And to recruit Credence.

Yet… will Skender give him up just like that?

I mentioned that Credence has been betrayed before… but what if we get a different story this time?
What if Skender originally agreed to eventually hand him over and abused the fact that he had nowhere to go…  but over time found a liking in him?

He may hand him over as planned, but start to question his decision - maybe even go against Grindelwald in the boy’s defence (along with the rest of the circus staff… or pushed by them?).

This would not only make a contrast to Credence’ story with Graves aka Grindelwald, but also make Skender a very interesting character.

This is a theory on two new characteres we meet in the next movie - and **a possible connection by blood** that blew my mind :D enjoy :))


_______________________________________________________


**Bunty**

We don’t have much information on the character of “Bunty” yet, neither on if she is a follower of Grindelwald, an auror or a circus artist. To get anything at all, I tried to translate her name … yet it’s simply a name in English.
But JK Rowling, as we know, regularily hides meanings in her charactere’s names. So maybe we have to step away from english …

“Bunt” is the german word for “colourful” - if she has an ability that can be connected to this, in makes sense… she may be a **Methamorphmagi.**
If she can transform her appearence to her will, it is likely that she works at the circus… **and maybe for a reason.**

What if she left her family behind? Maybe a wealthy magical family… one where **the metamorph-genes would be passed on to another member many years later?**
Now this is complete speculation, but it would be awesome if she really was another rebel of the Black family - or **Rosier, Tonk’s grandmother?**


______________________________________________________________________


**Bunty and Rosier**

Tonks grandmother was a black, yet only got this name by marriage - her original name was Rosier.

Among the newt characteres for the Fantastic Beasts Sequel, there is a woman named “Rosier”. Concerning the timeline, she could be the great-grandmother of Tonks.
Methamorphmagi are seldom, after all..

But how does Bunty fit into this? Since she is clearly older than Rosier, she can’t be her sister… yet likely an **estranged relative.**

This would explain why she is the Metamorphmagi… yet the other Rosier passed these genes on to her great-granddaughter.

_________________________________________________________________________


**Countries**

Something I haven't mentioned yet is that these characteres are from different countries ... but this doesn't destory my theory yet.
Maybe a part of the Rosier family moved to England a generation ago... maybe through marriage, maybe for other reasons. There aren't many pure-blood families, after all...

1898,RedSiren2,1512814504,"Hi there :)

I've already posted a theory on how the engagement of Leta Lestrange and Theseus Scamander was possibly based on love potion or experimental magic - yet recently another conclusion popped up in my head... 

What if they're not in love - **but acting as spies for the two sides of the upcoming war?**

_____________________________


**Theseus**

We know so far that Theseus is the head of the aurors department in the british ministry of magic. When Grindelwald escapes in 1927 and starts to gather followers, there may be concerns in the ministry that a widely known family of dark wizards, **the Lestranges**, may soonly be joining his forces... they decide it's best to keep an eye on them ... several, and especially one of them... that Theseus has known for a long time, since she was his brothers best friend. 

Not only could he have agreed to this because he knows her and her family are at risk to join Grindelwald ... but also because she's known for experiments... maybe even skilled at this... and allegedly ""confused and damaged"". Grindelwald could be interested in her talents... 

... if she isn't already in. And has orders as well.

________________________________________________________


**Leta**

There are two options what Leta's part in this could be.

* She is a follower of Grindelwald and was asked to join not only for her blood and knowledge, but also for that she had a connection to Theseus Scamander - he's a very active figure in the hunt for Grindelwald, who surely would like him out of the way ... yet killing him would not only start a riot within the ministry, but also take away the option to spy on it through somebody else... yet I'm not sure how that works yet, he must have taken care of that she won't get any information... yet once he believes she is innocent... 

* She knows exactly why Theseus is trying to bond with her and feeds him information in small doses to help the other side... always making sure the dark side doesn't suspect her... yet what if she does that to make the ministry believe she is on their side? What if once it's all revealed she secretly still follows Grindelwald? What if she turns away from him towards the end of the series? 

* She is aware of Theseus' plan, and slowly tries to turn him to the Greater Good ideology... in very small doses, so he barely notices it... maybe he plays along to fullfill his role as spy, but starts to question is ideals... 

And she may be the one who came up with a romantic relationship and eventual engagement - knowing he would agree to not to lose her as a source of information

__________________________________

To sum it up, they may both act as spies for the other side - maybe even knowing about each others plans, but playing along - **for a Greater Good.**

1905,RedSiren2,1512597610,"Hi there :)

Another FB theory, I think I discovered something :)

It's easy to assume that Dumbledore got his phoenix Fawkes from his befriended magizoologist who has travelled the world and most likely isn't done rescuing illegaly trafficed animals either... but the timeline fits as well :)

___________________________________________________________

**The Timeline**


Fawkes was born before 1938, when his tail feathers were given to Mr. Ollivander to eventually fabricate the wands for Tom Riddle and Harry Potter...

Voldemort was born in 1926... which leaves us, since he was born on New Years' Eve, with 11 years.
And since the next movie will take place in 1928 - we still have 10 years.

Enough time for Newt to find and give Dumbledore a phoenix egg.


__________________________________________________________


**The Reason**

I believe Newt's reason for this present wasn't just sympathy, knowing Fawkes would be in good hands and that this was his teacher's patronus form...
I think he also wants to give him a companion...
The reason why Newt and Dumbledore became so close is possibly that they both are lonely people... Dumbledore for being too respected among and having lost most of his family, and Newt for struggling among people. 
Yet he has his creatures and eventually finds some good friends... I think he wants Fawkes to not only be a pet, but a true friend to Dumbledore.

And I can't wait to hear that theme again &lt;3

1918,RedSiren2,1512210392,"Hi there :)

Before we start this, I have to make a confession: I already made a theory on tumblr on the Obscurus and where Newt could have gotten it from - and completely messed it up concerning the timeline. It’s deleted now.

Today I’m trying again - because I’m still convinced that we haven’t been told the truth about this parasite in Newt’s suitcase. So enjoy :)

___________________________________________


**Information so far**

When we are introduced to the Obscurus in the movie, we are told it’s a parasite that is created when a young wizard or witch surpresses his magical powers. It feeds on the powers, but when it becomes too strong or when the wizard experiences strong negative emotions, it breaks out, becomes one with the wizard, causes destruction around or kills it’s host.


_______________________________________________________


**Newt’s obscurus**

In the movie, Newt claims to have managed to seperate the obscurus from it’s host, a young girl in Sudan…

Yet when he tells the story to Credence, he suddenly leaves out her heritage and said story starts to sound **identical to Ariana Dumbledore’s**.

It should also be pointed out that when asked what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of him, **he refuses to answer.**

Something is going on here… 

__________________________________________________


**Ariana‘s obscurus?**

So… could it be that he is actually been watching over Ariana’s obscurus?

This is where we get to my mistake from the last version of this theory. Ariana died in 1899, when Newt was only two years old.

He never met her in person … but her brother he knew well.

But can an obscurus survive for an unlimited amount of time?


**Really? I can only sum up what we get to see, I can’t wrap my mind around it yet.**


* The Obscurus is said to be unable to survive outside the host - yet when Newt states this, it’s clearly alive and has been for the entire movie… but I think this was just wrong words, he probably meant that it can’t harm anyone outside it’s host.
* The Obscurus is said to be a parasite - but it seems to be made out of energy… can it die? Does it sleep until finding a new energy source? Does Newt feed it with magic? Is he doing research on it?

Considering the last point, we can actually build up a story, starting back in Hogwarts.

___________________________________________________


**The story of Albus Dumbledore and Newt Scamander**

Newt Scamander and Albus Dumbledore had always been getting along very well, and when Dumbledore heard of a possible expelling of his student, he of course wanted to help - yet he knew that this student would also possibly be able to help him with a problem he had been keeping for years…

After his sister had died, her obscurus remained - he couldn’t get himself to try  kill it since it was part of his sister, so he kept it locked away and started to research, in order to help those who would be infected in the future - without sucess.

He couldn’t find a solution … and then he met Newt Scamander

The young man had an extrodinary talent concerning magical creatures, and Dumbledore found that someone like him could possibly find a solution. So, when he got expelled from Hogwarts - Dumbledore offered to make possible he could keep his wand, but just like with Snape - he asked something in return.

He introduced the young man to his secret and tragic family story  - and asked him to research on the parasite that had been destroying his sister for years. Newt agreed, and hid it inside his suitcase, to observe and research on it for the following years.

Of course, this had to be kept secret - so he made up a story about a girl in Sudan, that he managed to seperate it from - and when he talked to Credence, he told him the story of Dumbledores sister he never had met.

_____________________________________________________


This is the secret that Newt has been keeping  just like he was asked to. But when will we know for sure?

I think at one point in the story, Newt either opens up to someone about the secret or is given Verita Serum.

I’m certainly looking foward to it :)

So, what do you think? Has Newt been keeping Ariana Dumbledore’s obscurus? Leave a comment if you have something to add :)

* she is New Yorkian

**Scenes**

* In a deleted scene, Credence is shown shooing away a pigeon in the Second Salemers home (if she was with Newt that time, she may have excused himself briefly, taking is suitcase with her to keep him near, and returned after)

1930,RedSiren2,1511795100,"Hi people :)

Here’s a list of ideas for possible Patroni of the FB characters… before you start, 2 things:

1. The Basset Hound was the Patronus Eddie Redmayne received after doing the Test on Pottermore, but it hasn’t been confirmed for his character

2. I almost went crazy trying to find the Patronus of Seraphina Piquery… there is a bird on the front of her golden hat, but no clue to which one it is… maybe you will find out, I didn’t.


__________________________________________________________

**Newt Scamander** - Basset Hound or Thunderbird 

* the Basset was the patronus Eddie Redmayne recieved on Pottermore
* a Thunderbird would make a connection to both his mother (likely related) hippogryph breeder) and Tina, who was sorted into House Thunderbird at Illvermorny

____________________________________________


**Tina Goldstein** - Pigeon

It wouldn't just fit with her character (positive. I love her very much) and usual wardrobe colour... there are strong hints to that she's actually an **animagus**(probably going to post my take on this theory soon)

_______________________________________________

**Queenie Goldstein** - Canary Bird or Cockatiel

* Again, this character fits for a cheerfull little bird.... and would make a connection to her sister's as the same species
* In a deleted scene, when singing the Illvermorny school anthem, Queenie starts with ""Ca-caw!"" to which Tina respons ""Purr, purr."" Sounds a little like a cockatiel...

_________________________________________________

**Credence Barebone**  - Augurey (Irish Phoenix)

* Like this magical creature, Credence is shy, skinny and often sadly-looking
* This creature is still a relative of the phoenix, yet more subtle
(also, i believe Newt has one in his case that Credence befriends and names **""Moses""**

_______________________________________________________

**Theseus Scamander** - Bull

* a connection to his strong personality and protective nature
* a symbolic connection to his mother, representing him possibly coming more after his father (back is a horse, not a bull), yet showing it's still a connection, especially if you consider that the other association is the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur who's top half was a bull

__________________________________________


**Maledictus** - Python Snake

* representing that she isn't poisonous (vicious) but not to be meddled with
* connecting to her pythons and the fact that they are good pets if treated right

_____________________________________________


**Percival Graves** - Wolf

* representing his strong personality
* marking that he is a leader of a pack, he cares for those with him

____________________________________________

**Leta Lestrange** - Cat

* an often ambigious character
* probably misjudged (? like the House Slytherin?)
* still loyal in a way ?

______________________________________


**Gellert Grindelwald** - Sparrowhawk/Hawk/Dragon

* vicious, strong character
* Sparrowhawk/hawk are not intimidating at first sight
* Sparrowhawks are pretty brutal

______________________________________

**Mrs. Scamander** - Hippogryph

* making a connection to the animals she breeds
* a free-spirited, but strong and defensive character

1931,RedSiren2,1511692899,"I tried to describe the farm I see in my mind :)

A small house (almost exactly the top house of the Weasley home you see) since it only needed to house 3 people… and a giant stable for the hippogryphs as well as a small barn.

The house has a living room, a large kitchen, 3 bedrooms, one bathroom an and attic, as well as a large garden outside.


_____________________________________________


**The ground floor**

The house door features a golden hippogryph knocking ring… **which taunts both brothers if they look like they haven’t eaten or slept enough.**

Entering the house, you’re passing a short hallway with a hallstand (jackets hooks on a wooden hippogryph). Then you enter the kitchen, with a table and three chairs (and some halfly chopped meat on the worktop for sick gryphs) which has an open wall to the living room, featuring two sofas, a bookshelf (with the fairtales of Beedle the bard etc. as well as, of course “Fantastic Beasts and where to find them”) a radio and a chimney.

There is small decoration of magical creatures and hippogryphs everywhere, as well as photos of Mrs. Scamander, but mostly Newt and Theseus on the walls, as small children, sitting on their brooms, wearing Hogwarts uniform, posing with hippogryphs. There are also framed copies of their reached certificates as student/auror/zoologist. On the back wall of the living room you can find the door to the medium-sized bathroom featuring a tub. Next to the bathroom door is a back door leading to the garden and stable.

Mrs. Scamanders bedroom is also parterre so she can react quickly if something is wrong in the stable. The brothers bedrooms are on the first floor.


________________________________________________________________________


**The first floor**

On the first floor, you actually only find a hallway with one door on each side. The floor isn’t large, but in the years her sons were born, Mrs. Scamander decided they should have much and specificly equal space, so she just turned it into two rooms. Also, the bathroom is downstairs and enough for three people.

**Theseus’ room** is decorated in the colours of his house gryffindor, but very tidy. It also features a desk, a bookshelf with photos of his small family, him and Newt, and of his friends from school on top, the framed letter which informed him of his acceptance in the department of magical law enforcement in of the ministry of magic, a bed, a broomstick stading to the wall and some posters from magical bands and his favourite quidditch teams. There is also a cupboard and a drawer cabinet

**Newt’s room** is decorated in Hufflepuff colours and the floor is tidy, but only turned this way when he moved out. The desk is still scattered with feathers and scribbles of magical creatures as well as notes and differing books. The walls are pinned full of drawings of creatures, pages from books concerning them, and like his brother, posters of magical bands and his favourite quidditch team. There are different pairs of shoes under his bed. The room also features a bookshelf, but Newt putted bones and other items from animals and an empty cage on it. Yet he does have photos… there’s one of his family and one of him and Theseus on the desk, and a place where Leta’s used to stand. There is also a broomstick, but it’s lying under the bed with the shoes, as well as a cupboard and a drawer cabinet… latter stuffed beyond reason.

**The attic**

The attic is just an attic, stuffed with all kinds of magical and non-magical items. Theseus and Newt loved it explore it as children.


________________________________________________


**The garden/stable/barn**

Leaving the house through the back door, you pass beets with vegetables and herbs and a small meadow with fruit trees, before you reach the back door of the stable.  Said stable is mostly a large room with a wooden fence, so visitors can examine the hippogryphs without getting too close. It has an open door so the gryphs can come and go as they please. Behind the stable is a large fenced out meadow… but only so they can have a location to fly off and land.

Through a nearby door, you enter the small barn, where you find a cupboard with medical equipment for animals and humans in it. The barn is filled with straw and skinny branches so the gryphs can build a comfortable nest, and entering a separate room, you find horizontal pole with chicken and ferrets hanging from it, fresh of course.


**The Hippogryphs (side note)**

The hippogryphs are fed properly so they don’t go hunting, and put a spell on to make them invisible as they go flying. Within an exact distance from the house, the gryphs feel the need to fly another way, towards it again… if they ever go so far, most do not fly too far from their herd.  The need to return is what they also feel when they come near humans outside the farm grounds. Such as spell is also around the front of the house and the garden, so visitors don’t get into a dangerous situation by accident.


_____________________________________


**The location**

The house is located in a distance from the next village … since Mrs. Scamander is more comfortable with her gryphs than with humans. A disadvantage when Theseus wanted to meet friends from elementary school (but I’m sure they came up with a solution for that - either invisibly flying or make just by bike) but an advantage for Newt who felt like his mother **(in my mind, he's a small version of her)**… and an advantage for both brothers when they wanted to play Quidditch.

_________________________________________________

Newt and Theseus now of course live by their own, but still visit their mother as often as possible, and on holidays. They have wonderful childhood memories of the farm and their sweet, small family.

I’ve a few other observations to back this up:

• Nagini simply sounds like a circus name, as it strongly phonetically evokes ‘Houdini’ - 
‘My dear witches and wizards, I present to you, the terrifyingly tendrilous, the fantastically fanged...the Great Nagini!’

• The way she is sitting next to Credence implies a kind of temptation, this obviously has overtones Of Eve’s temptation by the Snake (Lucifer in disguise)...Gravesdelwald was determined to harness Credence for his muggle-subjugating ends, and I don’t think this has stopped. My theory is that he has contacted Nagini to tempt Credence away (possible out of blackmail, her family may be being held hostage by GG) not by force as Graves ultimately tried to do, but from his heart...this could lead to some very heavy/emotionally intense scenes of betrayal and anger between the two. 

• Similarly, Credence’s name is another word for ‘Belief’ - more precisely, his name indicates that he is the embodiment of belief. This explains why he was literally credulous of Graves believing in him, and it’s the same reason and virtue/fault that seems sadly to be what Claudia’s character will take advantage of once again...poor Credence :(

In one of my previous theories, I stated that we may get to see Hagrid being expelled from Hogwarts, since it fits into the timeline and Newt had a part in it … yet I wondered how Hagrid was expelled. Because if we look closely at how the case of Myrtle’s murder, there is actually a lot of hints that needed to be covered so Tom Riddle wouldn’t be suspect any longer…

So enjoy :)


_____________________________________________________________________________


**The corpse**

I already said that Newt may be called to the scene/the ministries’ forensic department to examine the corpse as an expert for magical creatures… so, what will he see?

When Myrtle was killed, there were no physical bruises, leave alone a bitemark… so, either her corpse was left the way it was, or Tom Riddle, talented as he was, faked the biting marks.

I do wonder about where he would get fangs from an Acromantula from. We know he had a good relationship with Horace Slughorn that time, so despite that Acromantula poison is very seldom…

But there is a way how all of this fits together.

And that is Tom Riddles magical power, and the ability to change memories.

_______________________________________________


**A perfect murder**

So, Tom Riddle is all alone - the Basilisk just killed a student, he is standing before her corpse. This was unintentional, and he knows what will happen if he is seen. And he has an idea (or was prepared already).


Getting Aragog

How exactly did he know about the Acromantula Hagrid was hiding? I don’t know for sure, but I believe he found out about him and decided not to tell Professor Dibbet, in case he would need him some day.

Yes, I believe Tom Riddle already prepared himself for an occuring murder, since he could call and talk to the Basilisk already and knew what it was capable of. Yet I’m not sure if he really wanted to kill someone back then since Hogwarts was his only home… maybe he already wanted to point the blame towards Aragog and stop the murders once he was killed. 

So, what if he quickly leaves after the murder and seals the door briefly? He then goes for the closet the spider is in, puts it under an imperius curse and (we know it’s possible) hides it in his school bag with a room spreading spell?


_________________________________________


**Back at the toilet**

He goes back to the toilet, tells Aragog to bite the corpse, and then … can he make the poison going through her blood system? Because even if, a trained magic forensic will still find that this wasn’t the cause of her death. But we don’t know if one could tell in 1943… certainly spells and magic need to be evolved and developed as well over time.

So, he returns Aragog to the closet and changes his memories so he doesn’t recall the situation. He had to flee soon, and even if he had claimed that he didn’t kill the girl… who would believe a monstrous spider, able to kill humans?

Returning to the toilet, Tom probably changes Myrtle’s memories as well… but here we get to a tricky situation.

Myrtle is a ghost. I think even for Tom, it was difficult to change her memory… but we know Ghosts can be harmed as well (Sir Nicolas was frozen by the look of the Basilisk), so why not be put under a spell?

But he may have failed to change her memory completely. He is prefect of Slytherin that time, so even if he speaks Parsel… can she regognize his voice? But maybe he was lucky … and Myrtle really only remembered large yellow eyes and a boy’s voice … and that probably wasn’t enough.

_______________________________________________________


**Myrtle’s witness**

Maybe it even was the spider’s bite that made people disbelief her. It may have been assumed that she simply hallucinated from the poison and her memories are false.

Maybe Newt will try and take a closer look at the case, but he probably won’t be able to proof Aragog’s innocence either.

Tom Riddle will have won for the first time.

1939,RedSiren2,1511202267,"Hello people :)

I may have already posted too many theories on Fantastic Beasts so far, but I just can’t stop. I keep going through what we may get in a timeline up to 1945 … and I realized one storyline we get is the childhood and Hogwarts years of Rubeus Hagrid (and Aragog, which is almost certain)…

So enjoy :)

_____________________________________________________


**The Timeline**

So far, we know that Fantastic Beasts will take place up until 1945, with the next movie settling in 1928 - the year Hagrid was born.

Hagrid enters Hogwarts in 1940, and is expelled in either 1942 or 1943 - which is the year when he got Aragog, who describes that he came from a distant country as an egg, **in the suitcase of a traveller…**

________________________________________________


**Hagrid’s life at 13**

Hagrid’s father, as we know, died when he was in his second year at Hogwarts … we know that Dumbledore took care of that he could stay at the school afterwards, and of that he could become junior gamekeeper at 13… but in between these years, I imagine Hagrid was quite depressed and lonely … until he meets Harry, Ron and Hermione, he is said to have developed a drinking problem (which he turns away from by the end of Philosopher’s stone).

So, what if Newt briefly revisits Hogwarts in 1941/42 and meets the young boy who has lost his family, but shows as much interest in magical creatures as he does (Hagrid might even be a fan of him through his book)?

I imagine through Hagrids knowledge of magical beasts, Newt may give him an egg to take care of, so he has something to help him get over his loss, both by requiring his attention and also becoming a friend for him…

**… and he makes a mistake.**

I do not believe Newt would voluntarily give an Acromantula, a creature that even he has not much information on yet, and is undeniably dangerous, to a 13-year old boy.

I believe he thought there was something else inside, and when he found out… it was too late.

Or maybe he didn’t. We have the two options now:

_________________________________________


**Newt knew**

Newt found out that he gave Hagrid the wrong egg once he realized the Acromantula’s was missing, or the right egg had hatched, and he rushed to Hogwarts - only to find that Aragog had already been born and maybe also could talk - we know he remembers from inside his egg (maybe due to a soft shell) that he was inside a suitcase, and a traveller had taken him… so it’s not that far fetched that he might have heard human language and later even further adapted it from Hagrid. Newt also met the situation that Aragog and Hargid had become inseperable and couldn’t take the spider back with him since he didn’t want to torment Hagrid… which makes me wonder what Dumbledore said to this one year later when it must have been clear to him where Hagrid got this creature from.

__________________________________________________________


**Newt didn’t know**

I wonder if Newt, having so many creatures to take care of, Grindelwald by this point possibly roaming Europe, and his new friends and love-interest Tina requiring his attention, just didn’t realize that he had given Hagrid the wrong egg. I don’t know how long it takes for Acromantula eggs to hatch, so maybe he didn’t expect it to be quick/assumed the egg just didn’t hatch. Or he realized it an entire year later when Hagrid was accused of killing a student by keeping Aragog… maybe the boy thought he just had been what he wanted to trust him with.

__________________________________________________


**Hagrid’s expelling**

We do not know yet how many people took part in the case of Hagrid vs Riddle at Hogwarts … we know that Professor Dibbet stood up for Tom Riddle, Dumbledore defended Hagrid… and maybe Newt entered the situation as well.

Maybe we get to see Newt standing up for Hagrid, as this case certainly reminds him of his own expelling, and tries to take the blame… while figuring slowly that something else is going on around this case.

I mean, he must have figured when examining the corpse, (maybe they even call him to the situation as an expert in magical cretaures)  since it certainly had no biting marks - and due to this result, Hagrid is only expelled for the possession of the beast/the threat). Sure, later there was still a story going around … but, that could simply be gossip.

He may even realize what happened… anyone in for a scene with Newt vs a Young Tom Riddle?

I also wonder if Myrtle gets to say something during this case - will she be able to state what she saw? Will she add that she heard Tom’s voice? Will they believe her? Does he come up with a fake alibi from his already present followers? And after all, after her murder, if nothing else happens, will they disbelief or keep secret that there is a Basilisk at Hogwarts, to avoid that the school is closed?

We’ll see.


Please let me know if you want to add something. :)

",FantasticBeasts,Hagrid in Fantastic Beasts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/7eawyn/hagrid_in_fantastic_beasts/,1511173467.0
1940,RedSiren2,1511110344,"Hi there :)

A while ago, I posted a theory on how the Fantastic beasts series could introduce a werewolf as a love interest of Credence Barebone ... with new information concerning the plot of the second movie, there are some hints to that this person will appear in the sequel already.
My fingers are shivering with excitement, so let's begin!


_______________________________________________________________


**Information so far**

From leaked information on the character of Maledictus, she is said to be under a *""blood curse""* that will increasingly turn her into a monster (at least it was put this way in german, the phrase in english may give us something else). The very name ""Maledictus"" means ""Cursed"" or ""Slandered"". 

So, could they mean a werewolf curse? *Can this curse be passed on by blood?*

*Possibly.*

Yet the information we are given is vague. 

___________________________________________

**A tiny lesson in Lycanism**

In HP7, Remus Lupin attempts to leave Tonks, *in fear that the child she carries may be infected*, which he couldn't forgive himself.
Teddy Lupin however turns out fine. So, the chance to receive the curse is at least not 100 %. Also, we know from Lupin that werewolves usually don't have offspring, so noone can rely on any research to (so many) questions... 
When would a werewolf child show symptoms? Only in later years or younger? Or by the age their parent was infected? Is that why she joined the circus after (probably) running away from home? Will the movie start by the middle of a month, when she has been experiencing *alarming symptoms* for the first time and worries about the upcoming full moon?

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Or could it be *something entierly else?* Something that has to do with her employment as a *snake* artist?

On the picture, we see no hints to this yet... all we see is that she has dark shadows under her eyes and her hair is kind of messy... and that she leans onto Credence, with a sad expression... we know from the HP Saga that werewolves tend to be tired and exhausted before a full moon... 

________________________________________________________________________


**Two lonely souls**

In one of my recent theories, I tried to analyze her appearent relationship to Credence - they seemed close, though not specificly in a romantic way...

They seem to be close at least... maybe not only for their shared curses ( or in his case, probably decreasing one - I'm positive once he gets a wand, he won't be experiencing any issues at all any more - while... oh, while she has to deal with a curse becomes *increasingly stronger,* with no hope for a cure).
Maybe that is the reason she joined the circus in the first place ... no matter if this is a case of werewolf curse or not, she couldn't stay where she was... just like Creed.

And the Circus is not only her refuge before she turns into a werewolf or permanently into a monster... but also afterwards. 

If she is struck with the curse, she may be exhibited to the audiences as a functional warning of werewolves. Maybe she was taken in by Skender because he knew aside her abilities as a snake artist, she may become a phenomenon if her curse awakens and is shown to the public.

If she simply turns into a sort of monster, she will be free to join the *Freak Show*.

She can rely on always being able to live in the circus.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

**Any escape?**

Once Credence decides to leave the circus, he may ask her to come with him ... they are friends after all, and he certainly will want her to be free. The question is if she agrees to it. No matter if the circus is destroyed or not, she may not see a life for herself... or maybe she does and becomes a frequent character, who knows.
I kinda wouldn't like them to be a thing from the beginning on... I'd like Credence to find someone after a while, but that's just my opinion. 
____________________________________________________________

So, what do you think? Is Maledictus a werewolf?
Or is she something not mentioned yet?

1942,RedSiren2,1510943937,"Here’s part two of my theory concerning the couples in the upcoming “Fantastic Beasts” Sequel “The Crimes of Grindelwald” (not entirely friends with this title yet).

Now focussing on how Credence and Maledictus seem to be in a relationship.

This one is shorter than my theory on Leta and Theseus, so enjoy :)


___________________________________


**A woman?**

Some fans pointed out already that the scenes with Graves in FB in the script, were specificly described as carrying a sexual tone… if you look at the scenes knowing this, one can assume that Credence may love men…

Nothing bad, I’d enjoy a good lovestory with him and another man in this series. So why is he with a woman now? And why so suddenly?

____________________________________________________


**Are they together at all?**

Maybe I was wrong all along, and Creed didn’t make any friends except one at the Circus … him and Maledictus could have simply developed a close relationship through being outsiders … and she just cuddles him, after all…

___________________________________________________


**A little fast….**

Let’s get back to relationships… maybe they are together. But… that doesn’t necessairly mean Creed has given up men …

Isn’t it suprising that, two years after escaping a life of opression and with little to no social skills, he suddenly finds himself in a relationship? It would make sense, however, if he was trying to escape himself… he certainly hasn’t heard any good about his sexuality back home, maybe neither afterwards… he may try to surpress and hide it as good as he can, by… trying a relationship with a woman.

Or he is just trying out… maybe he isn’t sure about his feelings after all… he’s just 18 by the time of the second movie, most likely without any knowledge concerning sexuality and growing up…

And to get back to the photo … he’s not moving. Even as it starts to move in the teaser, he sits still, doesn’t make any movement towards her… 

... either he doesn’t want to or… he doesn’t want to.

What do you think? Is this a relationship or may we get a more complex/interesting plot for the FB movie? Please let me know in the comments?

Thank you very much for reading :)",FantasticBeasts,New couples and why I’m not really buying it (Part 2),https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/7dn01t/new_couples_and_why_im_not_really_buying_it_part_2/,1510915137.0
1944,RedSiren2,1510925147,"Hi there :)

So, the first picture of the Cast of Fantastic Beasts - The Crimes of Grindelwald has been released.

There isn’t much to say here… we were informed of most of the cast already, and I really like it so far… but the two new couples (?) in the picture got me thinking… let’s start with **Leta and Theseus** for this part one, because there is MUCH to say to this!


____________________________________________________________________________________


When I first saw this picture of them sitting close, holding hands, my reaction was … 

**NOOOO GOD NOOOOOOO!**

But quickly realized

**It's a trap!**

I’m convinced that this was supposed to blow up the minds of the fans, and make us think “What? Why would they become a couple? Why would they do this to Newt?”

And after a while you realize… they can’t.
_______________________________________


**Theseus**

We haven’t seen much of Theseus Scamander yet, but we know

* he’s a war hero, and apperantly not stupid
* he loves his brother and writes him frequently (and the letter published was **friendly and easy, no sign of disgrace, of negativity…**)

And I’m positive he knows that Newt only took the blame for the incident at Hogwarts…. To which Leta eventually replied by breaking up with him, relieving him of his **only friend**… aside his brother.

There is no logical explanation to why he would be interested in her. Leave alone the fact that she is described as “confused and damaged” by the directors so far.

And even if he did faire an interest in her - why would he give in to this? He’s a celebrated war hero and auror at the ministry… there’s enough women to meet for him. **Why should he develop romantic feelings for the woman who brought so much pain upon his brother?**

He should know that by dating the women who broke him, he’s following her away from Newt… leaving his brother behind, alone.

And that makes no sense. If he is to become a frequent character of the series, there’s no point in making him entierly hateable.


___________________________________________________________________


**Leta**

Yet… this relationship would make sense for Leta.

Theseus is sucessfull, and looks very alike Newt… and if she is as Queenie described her… she would have no problem with this. Considering that she accepted Newt being expelled and later breaking up… she may be able to do worse.

But Theseus, as we can conclude, would never date her … ever…

Only… **against his will.**

* **a Love potion**
* **Experimental magic (for which she is known!)**
* **Other magic**

**Choose one.**

But why would she do that?

I got two theories:


__________________________________________________________________


* **She may be a follower of Grindelwald** and was ordered, since they know each other from Hogwarts, to take control over this challenger of him in the ministry. We know Theseus was assigned to the hunt for Grindelwald, who must know that he will cause problems… maybe already has.
* **She wants to hurt Newt for finding a new love…** we are able to see by the end of FB 1 that Tina is more to Newt than just a friend… and they most certainly stayed in letter contact over the passed two years. Once Leta finds out, she doesn’t accept it… and decides to not only find herself someone new, but also to destroy his relationship to his brother.

She is a damaged woman after all.

(Also, there is a chance that she knows **occlumentic techniques… ** Bellatrix Lestrange knew them, if she had learned ot from her husband… so even Queenie wouldn’t be able to see what she's up to.)

___________________________________________


**Where does this lead to?**

* Newt sooner or later finds out about the couple and is struck severly by it
* Eventually, it is found out that Leta has only been controlling Theseus - who is enraged that she caused him to do the **unthinkable** - break his brothers heart. 

_____________________________________________________________


**Last evidence?**


or this, you will need to take a look at the picture again.

See it? She is holding his arm, putting her hand over his… **but he does nothing. He even slightly leans away from her.**

**If she was photoshopped out of the picture, there would be no difference.**

If that isn’t a hint to that she is the active part of this couple, I don’t know what is… yet.

If you have anything to add, maybe teased story elements for the next movie, let me know in the comments :)

For the second part of the theory, I’ll be taking on Credence and the Snake artist.

Thank you very much for reading :)

**Newt:** *sighs* Alright. *turns around* I smuggled a Jarvey into the school.

**Theseus:** How?

**Newt:** In a bag. You know how it works.

**Theseus:** Why?

**Newt:** I wanted to study it. And … wanted to show someone else there was nothing to fear.

**Theseus:** Indeed?

**Newt:** It went wrong. I should have known. And I can’t forgive myself… I deserve what they -

**Theseus:** Shut .. up.

**Newt:** What?

**Theseus:** Most of the teachers don’t seem to understand when someone is lying to their face, but I know you. It’s all made up.

**Newt:** … but they do believe me, don’t they? *turns around again, pulls out suitcase from under bed*

**Theseus:** *walks over and rips a shirt out of Newts hands* You can’t be serious!

**Newt:** I am. I’m leaving for good.

**Theseus:** You’re leaving for Leta.

**Newt**: I don’t mind.

**Theseus:** *yells* WHAT IF I DO?

**Newt:** *twitches* Don’t…

**Theseus:** Huh? What if I care?

**Newt:** *silence*

**Theseus:** Does she?

**Newt:** *angry* Of course!

**Theseus:** Really? Did she tell you that?

**Newt:** You don’t understand!

**Theseus:** What?

**Newt:** You know her family! If she is expelled, they will… I… I can’t let this happen! She’s the only friend I have!

**Theseus:** … what about me?

**Newt:** I’d do the same for you.

**Theseus:** … her family is rich. They’ll just send her to Beauxbatons…… or Ilvermorny. Who knows?

**Newt:** And if she stays there? If she meets someone else?

**Theseus:** … so that’s what this is about?

**Newt:** This you should understand.

**Theseus:** Alright … what if you met somebody else outside school?

**Newt:** Who, The? Didn’t you say you know me? *sits down* I can’t even make friends … how am I supposed to find another match like her?

**Theseus:** *sits down* The world is big… didn’t you want to travel?

**Newt:** *scoffs* Big, yes… filled with all kinds of awful human beings…

**Theseus:** *sighs* More of them than you know are your kind of awful.

**Newt:** *chuckles*

**Theseus:** *chuckles*

**Newt:** It’s not just for her… I don’t mind leaving school…

**Theseus:** Didn’t you say you like it here?

**Newt:** Of course I do… and I’m going to miss it … but I’ve learned enough. Don’t need any O.W.L.s… I want to go into Zoology.

**Theseus:** You do want to spend your life with all kinds of creatures, don’t you? That’s what you’ve always wanted.

**Newt:** It’s what makes me happy.

**Theseus:** *sighs*Without any O.W.L.s …

**Newt:** I’ll have to convince them without. And once Leta is done with school, she’ll join me… and then we’ll spend our life’s studying magical creatures, maybe travelling around the world together…

**Theseus:** What about her family then?

**Newt:** Once we make enough money, they’ll be content. And if not… she doesn’t need them. And they don’t mind losing a family member.

**Theseus:** Alright … if you say so…

**Newt:** She promised me.

**Theseus:** *silence* *nods*

**Newt:** I’ll be alright, The. I still got my wand… they’ll notice that.

**Theseus:** *nods* … You could still ask Dumbledore if…

**Newt:** He’s done more than enough for me. And … I want to do this.

**Theseus:** *silence*

**Newt:** Don’t try to convince me otherwise… or them. Please…

**Theseus:** *silence*

**Newt:** *puts hand on his back* You can’t protect me this time.

**Theseus:** *tears roll down face* Newt… dammit, you can't just... 

**Newt:** *hugs him* *tears running as well* We’ll write each other.

**Theseus:** Sure… I can’t leave you all unattended, right?

**Newt:** *chuckles*

**Theseus:** What if you chose wrong?

**Newt:** Then I’ll go home. Look after of the Hippogriffs… didn’t you say your life was going somewhere else?

**Theseus:** True.

**Newt:** *smiles*

**Theseus:** But that’s not all I meant…

**Newt:** I trust Leta.

**Theseus:** *sighs*

**Newt:** She’s not going to let me down.

**Theseus:** *silence*

**Newt:** *sighs*

**Theseus:** *lets go* Let’s drop that… when are you leaving?

**Newt:** If they expel me, which is certain… by the end of the week. I’m not allowed to answer questions from the others… I’ll just attend classes until they give me a date to leave.

**Theseus:** … I’ll ask for a day off. They’ll let me go…

**Newt:** Are you sure?

**Theseus:** Well, I’ve got a more important NEWT to think about then, they’ll understand…

**Newt:** *laughs*

**Theseus:** Newt…

**Newt:** Yes?

**Theseus:** Nevermind. I’ll just miss you… like hell…

**Newt:** I’ll miss you too… like bloody hell. *wipes own tears away*

**Theseus:** *presses his hand*

**Newt:** *looks down* - *his stomach growls* Sorry… they kept me in their offices all day…

**Theseus:** Let’s go then, dinner should still be served…

*both get up and leave the room*

**Newt:** Wait. *pulls out wand from the door and swings it* *his belongings rise up and fly into his suitcase*

**Theseus:** *sighs*

**Newt:** Let’s go.

**Theseus:** *nods*

In my previous theory about Goldstein’s possible origin story I already stated that Tina and Queenie may be the results of magical experiments to create advanced spies (link below)… I actually already said almost everything about it there, but I want to state more evidence I came around recently that makes it clear that the MACUSA might know exactly about their powers, though most members seem to be unaware… 

https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasticbeastsseries/comments/7apq2k/dragon_pox_a_conspiracy_theory_spoiler_alert/

_________________________________________________________________________



**Tina**

*“Tina, you’re always turning up where you’re least wanted.”*

*Percival Graves aka Gellert Grindelwald*

__________________________________


This is what the disgusied Grindelwald tells Tina when they get into their fight by the end of the movie… I believe that there is more behind this. Just a little. A little, grey and feathery little.


Some fans have already suggested that Tina may be an animagus, being able to turn into a pigeon. 

Hints to that are:

* her often shy/nervous personality
* the generally grey colour of her wardrobe
* the collar of her coat that clearly resembles small wings
* Credence at one point shooing away a pigeon sitting on a window sill in the Second Salemers’s house (deleted scene)
* her future marriage to Newt Scamander (who would be a better match for him than someone who not only can turn into an *animal, but is in person very tied to it, as animagi allegedly are?)
* she is New Yorkian

So, Grindelwald probably got to know about Tina’s powers (has she revealed them to the government or do they know without her knowledge?) over Graves or the MACUSA… and it actually makes sense that she would be hired as an auror if they did know.

______________________________________________________________________


**An advantage for authorities**


Imagine the following situation: a group of aurors approaches a house/place where criminals are hiding … one of them can turn into an unsuspicious bird and fly to examine the situation. Also, she could spy perfectly on suspects.

And what if she has done that before? In the movie, she tells Newt that she was actually very sucessfull as an auror… probably because she could find their hideouts/hear their plans without being seen directly, especially in New York/ a city in general. Pigeons are everywhere, always… **turn up where they are least wanted.**

So, maybe the MACUSA does know about her powers and just let her do the job as the results were pleasing … but when she disobeyed, they had to act. Maybe one day they even might use it against her (hiding animagi powers is punishable with a prison sentence, even during the times of Harry Potter … and that is exactly why Hermione could get Rita Skeeter to stop writing in HP 4… who also used her power to spy on people…). Could this be a story like that? We’ll see.  

__________________________________________________________________


**Queenie**


So, Queenie has a diffrent situation to deal with, right? After all, she only brings coffee to conferences… or is there a plan behind this?

Our dearest Queenie is a Legilimentor… so, if she walks into a conference, not only could she choose to listen to the parttaking’s thoughts, but allegedly hears Tina’s mind from another story/department (?) of the ministry, as they lead her to the execution cell.

What if one day… she gets offered a well-paid job, still just delivering drinks… to more important conferences?

_____________________________________


**An advantage for the government**


Imagine the following situation:

Queenie walks into a conference with officials of another country. She delivers the coffee, or stands in the room to give out drinks when required, or even stands outside… all while hearing what the officials are actually thinking during the conference, and later delivering sensitive information to the government.

I believe that this would be an unimaginable advantage concering economy or foreign relations. I do believe that her powers are known to the MACUSA as well and may one day be used for their purposes. 


______________________________________



**How does the MACUSA know?**

I’m not sure yet how the MACUSA got to know the Goldsteins’s sisters powers. They may have a sort of magic scanning people for special abilites, a legilimentor among their own rows, or already a good set of spies.

I also wouldn‘t put it past that they actually secretly finance/perform **humans experiments to create wizards with special abilities** for their own purposes. As I stated before, this may be the reason why the Goldstein’s parents had to die.

And the reason why Tina and Queenie have not been used or recruted actively yet is maybe because the MACUSA wants to spare them until they are required for a … war perhaps?

Not impossible, isn’t it?


So, what do you think? Are Tina and Queenie the victims/supposed tools for a government that wants advantage at every cost?

Let me know if you want to add something :)

I’m really getting into theories lately … this one has also have too be written down, I think I found a muster for one of the upcoming Fantastic Beasts movies…

This is on how Creed (which will very likely join our little group of Newt, Tina, Jacob and Queenie) is yet the only one without a love interest… yet :)

I have some hints on what kind of a person it could be and where they will meet, so enjoy :)


___________________________________________


**Newt and werewolves**

From information about Newt Scamanders life from JK Rowling, we know that during his carreer, he has done a lot to better up the lives of werewolves in Britain. That is a very nice thing to do, but what if he had a personal reason for this? What if he knew someone who had been infected?

____________________________________________


I believe at one point of the story, the meet the werewolf either

**In Romania**

Why this country?

1. They have dragons

2. Newt has been to Eastern Europe duing WWI, so he definitly could some people in Romania, especially since he fought dragons there and certainly wasn’t the only scientist around

3. Romania is known for mythological creatures, such as vampires… but werewolves aren’t far from that

or **Circus Arcanus**. Both is possible.

_________________________________________


**Who is this person?**

In my opinion, they meet a young woman or man (considering the original script, I think it is possible that Creed may have a male love interest)

**1. Who is either another magizoologist**, maybe known to Newt, who has been infected during an expedition... 

**2. An artist in the Circus Arcanus**, maybe as he or she has nowhere else to go - who is exhibited to the audience during full moon nights (in a conjured cage, of course - which has been appreciated by several governments (as long as a team of experts is present during the shows) to effectivly warn toe public from werewolves

_______________________________________________________________________


**Love Story**


Credence soonly starts to bond with the person, who yet still tries to keep him distant from time to time ... also, it becomes more and more clear that this character has a secret... (for this we require that Queenie is not around - don't worry, she'll live, but she would warn the others if someone was potentially this dangerous).

When they find out (I'd like a scene in the moonlight) I think Tina will step in - revealing, as many theorize already, that **she is an animagus**. It was never mentioned in the movies, but in the Harry Potter books, it is clearly stated that werewolves can communicate with animals and animagi, (#Marauders :))

If we follow the circus story arc, Credence may rescue his that time friend from the unhappy life in the circus, and they'll eventually become a couple. Film 2, though two years later, would be a little too early for my taste. 

____________________________________________________


**But why a werewolf?**

I believe that a werewolf would be the perfect match for Creed - he knows how it feels to not to be able to control an inner demon that can kill (though I think the problem will be erased once he gets a wand and learns to unleash magic safely) and may even feel strongly connected to someone sharing this, and eager to help his love in every way he can. Also, even before the invention of the wolfbane potion, it was possible for wizards to live with this disease... though struggling to find employment and social acceptance. ... Scamander to the rescue.

But before they can settle down to a peacefull life, our werewolf may be chased by **extermination squads**, be rejected by people hearing of the disease... and cause an incident with a horrifiing result.

**Fenrir Greyback's origin?**


He is one of the most feared werewolves of his time, one who is crazy, obsessed with the sucess of the werewolf kind, and also infects Remus Lupin. Maybe our character will be the one to turn him accidently… after all, we do not know about his history. We only know he was born before 1945 … so if he was a child back then… this would be dark, but not impossible. This could explain why he is so insane and brutal, it’s a severe trauma from the werewolf attack that broke him. Also, it would be very tragic for the werewolf and the group, and possible lead Newt to put much more effort in the liberalization and research on help for werewolves.

**Still not convinced?**

Then I'll try one last thing:


**Credence &gt; crescent &gt; crecent moon &gt; full moon &gt; werewolf**

Really, this is no coincidence!! It can’t be!

Anyway, I’m looking foward to the next movies.

Thank you very much for reading :) ",FantasticBeasts,A werewolf in Fantastic Beasts? (Theory (Spoiler)),https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/7boks6/a_werewolf_in_fantastic_beasts_theory_spoiler/,1510147895.0
1952,RedSiren2,1509870564,"Hello people :)

A while ago, it has been announced that Callum Turner will be playing the role of Newt Scamanders brother Theseus in the Sequel to “Fantastic Beasts”.

I couldn’t help but immeadiatly go fanfiction in my head and get through possible scenarios we might get in the future films. I tried to sum up the main ideas that come to my mind concerning Theseus Scamander so far.

___________________________________________________


**Information so far**

The information about Theuseus we have so far is that

* he’s an auror
* he was assigned to the hunt for Grindelwald in 1926
* he’s a hero of the first wizard war
* he is said to be very powerful and “commanding”
* he wasn’t impressed with Newt’s choice to become an magical zoologist
* he still has a close relationship with his brother and writes him
* the language in a letter published suggests he's kind of ""easy-going""

So, what does this mean?

My main fear is that, despite the fact that he seems to be in good contact with Newt, we still may get an oldfashioned **strong jock and smart nerd - brother** story. The fact that Theuseus is an auror, highly honoured and possibly more comfortable around people, as well has his appearent commander attitude, suggests this by a bit.

Still, there are chances that we might have nothing like this happening.

_______________________________________________


**Trust in JK Rowling**

Our beloved Potter-author might not do such an outdated story to us. Sure, such stories happen in real life, but… so do others. I’m sure she won’t just ripp off a bland storyline like this for the two brothers.

______________________________________________________________


**Mrs. Scamander**

Their mother raised them both - there is a chance Newt turned out to be coming after her a lot more than Theseus, but chance is also that his brother is a gentle nature similar to them, maybe even having taken a lot of responsibility as the elder in the past (leading to his later career as an auror/soldier).

____________________________________________________________________________


**A guardian?**

Theseus' character and story may point to something other than a show-off carreer man … something more genuine…

We know he is a war hero, very responsible and powerfull, and commanding…

I wonder if in the past, when his mother or brother of even himself got wounded by hippogriffs, he learned to treat them medically (and them him, of course), especially as the elder sibling. And what if, later in school and during his youth, he had to **constantly look after and watch over Newt**?

Maybe he was always busy with shielding and defending his brother against bullies at Hogwarts, first-aid nursing him when an animal wounded him, or watching over that he wasn’t getting into trouble/dangerous situations with them… all of this may have led to him **suceeding as an auror**, and maybe even as a war hero. In battle, one also has to be cautious, responsible, sometimes commanding and being able to treat/rescue the wounded.

Maybe their relationship is deep because Theseus is feeling responsible for his younger brother. He may be often shaking his head about his actions, but not afraid to say that he doesn’t want to see him harmed. I also believe Newt loves his brother very much through that, despite their diffrences, Theseus has always been there for him, and vice versa. 

_______________________________________________


**What happend in Hogwarts**

I even believe he was present when Newt got expelled from school (most certainly through taking the blame for when an experiment by his girlfriend Leta Lestrange went terribly wrong and a student almost died). Callum Turner doesn’t look much older than Eddie Redmayne (though their age diffrence is actually 7 years), so this is quite possible.

What if Theseus, after all appearenly not stupid, figured out quickly that his brother was just freely taking the blame, throwing away his school carreer, and what seemed to be his working carreer as well (despite his sucess as a magical zoologist later), and was enraged? They certainly didn’t agree over this, but seem to have overcome it, since it certainly had no impact on their bond and it wound make no sense if it did.

I still believe that Theseus migh hold a grudge against Leta for not only accepting his brothers sacrifice, but also, as Queenie pointed, cheating on him/dumping him.

We may get to see in the future how he feels about her.

So, these are just some ideas so far…

But if you want to have any last foreshadowing on his character… look at his name.

_____________________________________________________


**Theseus**

You may have already thought that you have heard the name Theseus before. He is the hero of the famous greek legend of the **slaying of the Minotaurus** (making Theuseus in our story certainly a skilled fighter). Also, researching this legend, I found out that there was **a woman** who gave him a dread, to find his way through the labyrinth of the minotaurus and out again.

Her name was **Ariadne**.

Sounds like **Ariana**? That’s the name in italian.

And maybe… nonsense, certainly… this has a meaning.

1953,RedSiren2,1509795044,"Hello people :)

Oh, Fantastic Beasts… this movie keeps me by the mental screen with it’s endless clues to future sequels and possibilities for character stories.

What I want to discuss today is the mystery around Mary Lou Barebone’s adoptive daughter **Chastity**. Something is definitly odd about her, and today I want to theorize on what she could be…

Enjoy :)

_________________________________________


**The silent observer**

Chastity so far seems to kind of fade away in the background aside Credence and Modesty. She still is kind of an authority figure for the children who come to the Salemer’s house and gives orders to them.

Yet there is something that makes me suspicious … she keeps observing Credence, or watches the situation, as if she was ordered to… and when he is shortly before an outbreak of magic, she seems to be alarmed, as if knowing what is about to happen.

We don’t get to know much about her in the entire movie, and yet she always is present, like literally waiting to show more of herself and her story, almost as if JK Rowling was building her up in silence, to later reveal her indeed great part in this story… But what is it about her? Why is she observing Credence, what are her true intentions?I thought about it today for a while and I figured there is actually more to her… just not to her. My theory is that, for a great part of the movie … we only see someone who took the real Chastitiy’s place. 


______________________________________________


**A MACUSA spy?**

The MACUSA has been keeping an eye on the First Salemers for quite a while when the movie takes place. They were no serious threat, but one that certainly should not be underestimated through their constant propaganda and dependence on existence of magic people. My theory is that they wanted to be informed as well as possible about this group’s intentions and send a spy to the orphanage. They most likely decided, observed and then abducted the actual Chastity Barebone. If they didn’t use a spell for the disguise, they definitely required her hair for the polyjuice potion, thus to keep her alive.

And yes, polyjuice can give elder people the appearance of a younger person for a certain amount of time.

I strongly believe this spy didn’t just give them information, but also suspected after a while that either Credence or Modesty could be magical.

And here we get to something that might fit with a spy for MACUSA…


____________________________________________________________________


**Percival Graves’ investigation**

How did Graves know about Modesty? Who gave him the information that a wizard or witch might be among the children in the orphanage?

What if the actual Graves and later Grindelwald got the information from the spy at the orphanage? What if she knew about obscurials, and asked him to investigate? We know is the head of the auror section in the american ministry of magic, and certainly whoever took Chastities place is one.

By the end, we see the girl’s body lying on the ground… yet if she was magic, she could have dissaparated and replaced her body with a convincing magic fake one...  


______________________________________________________________



**A dead body**

The script describes that her corpse is seen lying on the floor after Credence had his obscurial outbreak at the orphanage… yet, when he did break out, she was suddenly gone from the chair she had been sitting on while watching the scene … and it might be possible that in the spy business of the magic world, it is common to be able to leave a fake dead body… a trained wizard may find out quickly that it isn’t real, but a muggle… they are easily fooled using magic. How could they ever find out it was fake? 

If MACUSA replaced the real Chastity with a spy from the ministry… a fellow fan said to me that this might be one reason why Tina was banned from the investigation on the Second Salemers… they already had a spy.

So, let’s assume she is a trained auror, mabye on Polyjuice, maybe even a senior, as we both agreed - there would be no problem if she just disaparated once Creed’s magic started to explode.

_____________________________________________


**Where is Chastity?**

So, if a spy entered and left the Second Salemers without being spotted… where is the real Chastity?

Things go dark now.

I believe that, if the MACUSA doesn’t have any other magic in use for shape-shifting, the girl migh be held captive and kept alive to use her hair for polyjuice, much in the fashion of Mad-Eye Moody. I don’t think this is impossible. We have seen the MACUSA’s death sentence policy, their attidude towards muggles… and I still believe from Grindelwald’s words by the end that there might even be something going on with him. Also, since she was confirmed dead… actually, it’s both possible that they obliviate her and let her go under a new identity (maybe change her memory) since she is an orphan with no actual relations outside the Second Salemers, or they decide, since her body was found, it’s too dangerous to let her go.


**Will we see her again?**


I do believe so. I think at some point of the story, one of the characteres, most likely Creed, will be brought to a secluded area within the ministry (who knows if they won’t try to exploit him as well) and meet her there, maybe spotting her in another cell and rescuing her. I wonder how the story will go on since she most likely will have no idea about the obscurial attacks in New York and Creed’s new life.

________________________________________________


So, what do you think? Is it possible that Chastities death was fake? And are her and the spy’s stories yet to come? 

Anyway, let me know in the comments if you want to add something to this theory. Maybe I’m completely wrong and there is an entirely different explanation for Chastitie’s behaviour.

Thank you very much for reading, and a big thanks to my fellow fan rebelliouspuritanboy on Tumblr for helping me with this :)

1954,RedSiren2,1509786258,"Hi there :)

In a recent theory on my Tumblr, I briefly scratced the highly explosive mindcandy topic of the Circus Arcanus in the next Fantastic Beasts movie… didn’t really get into the material, but after gaining more information on a certain deleted scene by the end of the first movie, I can now give a clearer option what we may get to see…

**(Spoiler alert)**

_____________________________________


**An offer he can’t refuse**


The scene we did not get to see by the end of the last movie contained the following summed up: Credence met with a russian ringmaster named Skender, who offered him refuge at his circus… Creed eventually agreed since his life in America was at stake. They left New York by ship towards Europe.

It has been confirmed that Skender (played by Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) is one of the main characteres featured in the next movie - he is rumored to be a rather ambigious character, but we’ll see for ourselves.

**A new life**


So Credence joins the circus… is this an improvement?

He is now living among wizards, which is certainly a plus… he may be given a wand as well, second-hand at first, just to practise, work and slightly lower his powers - a scene where he is actually given a wand that suits him may be saved for later in this movie especially.

I believe he soonly will bond with the circus staff - I don’t believe he has a problem with socialising in general, considering his relationships with Modesty and Mr. Graves, and how quickly he seemed to trust Newt. He may not become friends with everyone - but he’s a good lad, he’ll find himself some people - maybe even some misfits feeling with him, especially within the Freak Show staff.

_____________________________________________


**The show**


Now, among snake ladies, artists, freaks... what is an Obscurial to do?

We are given a list of abilities by the first movie

**- invisibility**

**- lifting people up in the air**

**- destroying solid materials**

I think he will take the role of an attraction invisible to the audience - since the MACUSA mustn’t know of his survival (though we can be certain that President Piquery does, following her eyes by the end of the finale) he may work undercover - they may be showing

**- a circus member pretending to crush a stone wall from a distance**

**- artists being lifted up into the air to perform**

**- people falling from a dancing rope, being caught in mid air**

For these performances, of course, he needs his obscurus - I believe he is ordered by Skender **to only decrease his powers down to not being dangerous, but still able to perform as a ghost assistant…**

Probably not the nicest way to live. 
___________________________________________
**An Escape**


Once Newt and the others arrive, Creed might see a chance for another life once again - he stayed with the circus because he had nowhere else to go, but there is no rest for him yet… Modesty is still in New York, all alone, and he certainly still thinks of Tina and Newt ... Also, even a controlled Obscurus may not be save to use… he may want to get rid of it once and for all eventually.

Also, can we trust Skender? Once Creed is fully able to control his powers, maybe by the time of the movie… **who tells us Grindelwald won’t show up to enslave him?** What if this was Skenders plan all along, what if he trained him in the course of two years for exactly this?

And if not… what will he do? Why would he let his special effects assistant go?

We’ll find out. And Merlin’s beard… I can’t wait.

I am aware that in real life, they are inspired by Hitler era Nazi undercut hairstyle but Hitler came to power only in 1933. So magical world couldn't have been copied from them.

I think Grindelwald had a different hairstyle and changed it to mimic Graves. If Graves had turned up with a new hairstyle one fine morning, people would have noticed.In a poster in the speakeasy, Grindelwald is seen with the same hairstyle. I think he was planning to infiltrate MACUSA. So he had cut his natural hair to match the undercut hairstyle of Graves yet styled differently so that it would not be obvious. Remember that Grindelwald had to transfigure himself, without the aid of polyjuice potion.

Alternatively, Grindelwald's hair might have just got ruffled. When we see him twice, it is after using some high energy spells. Also, his hair, like Harry's must have been naturally wild and untamed.

1985,Obversa,1494481722,"Recently, after some independent research, I noticed that there seem to be a lot of parallels between a magical child developing an Obscurus in *Fantastic Beasts*, and the way that children with autism are treated, particularly in sub-saharan African countries. Since Newt Scamander mentioned that he located an Obscurus in the form of a Sudanese girl, I thought it would be worth discussing.

More specifically, autistic children in sub-saharan Africa are often thought to be ""witches"":

> Across Sub-Saharan Africa, amongst the rural class, villages are completely thrown off when a child shows signs of autism.  This has led to a problem in countries such as Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi, and Uganda where villagers consider children who are showing autistic symptoms to be witches.

> Children with autism who are written off as witches often face torture and in some cases death because of their behavior.  Churches organize meetings and rituals in attempts to exorcise them. These communities do not have a grasp on scientific understanding or research, so they chalk up a child’s behavior to something extraordinary or out of this world. They then penalize the children for it out of fear that they will bring destruction into their homes.

> Belief in witchcraft is predominant amongst the rural class in these countries, and often in the most underprivileged areas.  Children with autism aren't the only ones who fall into the category however; something as simple as having asthma could have a child branded as a witch. Other common symptoms that lead to children being ostracized are: crying throughout the night, showing aggression towards others, and having severe tantrums. What makes it so much more difficult for these children is how much a child needs a loving family throughout their lives to progress and work on their everyday skills. [(Source)](http://www.icare4autism.org/news/2010/07/children-with-autism-branded-as-witches/)

[Here](http://www.africaontheblog.com/the-thin-line-between-autism-and-witchcraft-in-cameroon/) and [here](http://www.afrik-news.com/article17924.html) are other sources that also go into detail about just how these children in Africa are mistreated.

That being said, while there have been quite a few people who theorized that Newt Scamander is on the autism spectrum, I think that Credence Barebone - an Obscurial - along with possibly Arianna Dumbledore show more definitive signs of possibly being autistic. 

This is because, in the movie, Credence's behavior seems to fall in line with some of the symptoms of autism. The main one is that Credence never makes eye contact, or actively avoids eye contact, with most people in the film - and he seems largely silent / nonverbal throughout it as well. Likewise, he seems to have ""fits"" where the Obscurus within him wreaks havoc, usually after someone has upset or angered him in some way.

From what we know, Arianna Dumbledore also appeared to have ""fits"", as per recollections of her in the books. She even killed her own mother, Kendra, by accident during one such ""fit"", and had to be cared for / looked after at all times by one of her relatives.

Other symptoms of autism that also seem to match the known behavior of an Obscurial / Obscurus, particularly as related to Credence and Arianna:

- Seems to stare at nothing or wander around with no purpose
- Throws intense or violent tantrums
- Is overly active, uncooperative, or resistant
- Seems overly sensitive [to noise / stimuli]
- Doesn't smile when smiled at
- Has poor eye contact
- Seems to prefer to be alone
- Seems to be in his/her ""own world""
- Seems to tune people out
- Is not interested in other children
- Cannot explain what he/she wants

1992,Engelen12,1492285737,"I think that Mary Lou had a brother who was married with Credence his mother. 


""You're a squib, Credence. I could smell it of you the minute I met you."" 

Graves/Grindelwald tought that Credence was a squib. ""A Squib, also known as a wizard-born, is a non-magical person who is born to at least one magical parent."" Does this means that his father is a muggle? It could be. 

""I am not your ma! Your mother was a wicked, unnatural woman!"" 

It is clear that Mary Lou had known the mother of Credence. And if you know the mother, then you know the father to. And by these words of Mary Lou, the fans start to believe that she had something to do with the dead of Credence his parents. I have searched for a possible reason why Mary Lou could have killed them. 

""Some of them (Scourers) married No-Majs and founded families where magical children appear to have been winnowed out in favour of non-magical offspring, to maintain the Scourer’s cover."" 

Is this the reason why Mary Lou have killed them to extend the Scourers line? Yes, i think that Mary Lou is the aunt of Credence. We didn't know how she killed them. But I think that she wouldn' t want the dead of her brother and that it was an accident, only the dead of his witch wife and wizard son. So, Mary Lou was sad about the loss of her brother and had to raise his only son Credence, because she is his aunt. Scourers descendants like Mary Lou have a huge hate towards witches and wizards and they wouldn't want a magical child at home or in the family, they will rather kill the magical child then keeping it. So, maybe is this the possible reason why she had a wizard in her home.

""Barebone surname""

I think personally that Credence surname will never change during the books and movies if we found out who his father is. There are fantastic beasts books about the movie and in the books and we see the biographies of all the characters and they all tell Credence his Suriname is Barebone. It will be strange if Credence his surname get changed. JK Rowling never had change a name or surname. Also, you always get your father's surname. Modesty and Chastity aren't blood related to Credence. For the girls is Barebone they adopted name. But the name of Modesty and Chastity will also never change because Chastity is death, and Modesty isn't in the next movie. Possible, we see Modesty no more if the story always takes place in another country.

Moving on...
So we all know that Newt got expelled from Hogwarts for endangering human life with a beast…

So how come he still has his wand?

Hagrid was expelled, but he is not allowed his wand so why is it any different for Newt?


Maybe the law only came in after Newt was expelled… Maybe Newt was the reason the law was put in place.


Or maybe it depends on when you are expelled. We know Newt can apperate so he must have been expelled after the age of 17 unless he learnt somewhere else. Maybe if you are old enough and have learnt enough about magic, then you are allowed to keep your wand. It seems logical enough.


Perhaps the strangest thing is that in the textbook, it says that Newt DID graduate. Maybe Dumbledore was successful in his attempt to prevent Newt’s expulsion after all. But then what became of Leda?


I think there are lots of unanswered questions in Fantastic Beasts, but hey, we still have another 4 movies to clear things up.

2012,Engelen12,1487437968,"Modesty is a witch? First, it is not confirmed by JK Rowling that all adopted children have magical descendants. (I don 't think so) And there was no telling which Modesty her parents were magical, which was only said about Credence. I think Modesty isn' t a witch. Why? Let's see. 
                 
                 The mysterious wand:

 In the film, we see that Modesty had a wand  under her bed. Modesty is only eight years old. First, each witch or wizard gets his wand for the first time if he or she is eleven years old. Modesty is still too young for a wand, and also for magic. This also counts in America, where witches and wizards get his first wand when they first arrive at Ilvermorny. Besides, they also have a stern wand wed. You must register your wand. So it is impossible that a little girl like Modesty would have a wand. Though she is too young. It is forbidden and impossible to get a wand in America on her age, they'll just get on Ilvermorny.  Now, Mary Lou told Credence that his mother was a wicked, unnatural woman. Credence mother was a witch. And who will have studied at Ilvermorny and have a wand? Exactly, Credence mother. and that's  her wand. Mary Lou know Credence his mother. Mary Lou was some reason came in contact with her wand (cough cough maybe Mary Lou plays a part in the death of Credence witch mother cough cough) and hid it somewhere. Before Mary Lou said this about Credence his mother. Credence begged and said mom, Mary Lou then suddenly began to talk about his mother. Credence calls Mary Lou always mom in her presence. Mary Lou has never talked about Credence his mother as Credence calls her mom. and by that accident with the wand, It looks like the wand does remenber Mary Lou  of Credence his mother. Mary Lou was sure it was of Credence, she continued to accuse him. Modesty found the wand and thought it was a toy. She is very curious and likes to play. It could also be that such Modesty claimed, it's just a toy. It's in the script book and other books that it was a toy. Then Modesty would have gotten something from one of the children who attended the Second Salemers meetings. But I would find it strange if it were a toy, there are mysterious signs on the wand and the letter TSM is also  mysterious. 
              
                 Modesty role in the movie: 

During film, JK Rowling and the directors forests that we would not think Credence was the obscurus. They wanted to make us believe that Modesty was magical and that she was the obscurus. To make Modesty a kind of deception. For example, they did not show us (before Mary Lou died) Credence is in a corner behind Modesty hugging his knees. And how he slowly transforms into his obscurus. Then the belt flew out of Mary Lou her hands and she died. That scene was just focused on Modesty. Adjust only they showed at the right time that Credence was the obscurus. Modesty was all deception so we do not Credence would suspect. And by those misleading scenes and her scary behavior, we still think she is magical. 

                            Obscurus:

 Everyone knows what a obscurial is. A obscurial is a witch or wizard who tries to suppress his magic by trauma, and in an environment where they learned to hate his magic and fear. Where in his or her body a dark mass grows called a obscurus. If Modesty was a witch, she would have become a obscurus. Like that eight-year-old girl in Sudan who Newt had tried to save. But she's not a obscurus, so she's not a witch.

Modesty is not likely to be seen in the upcoming films: 

The next film is set in Paris, the directors say that modesty will not appear in the second film. That sounds pretty logical because the story takes place in Paris, and she is in America. If each movie takes place in another country, then it seems that Modesty will not return. The directors says, we follow Credence further.

2033,IsMisePrinceton,1481976729,"So I FINALLY watched the movie last night and I think it's a perfect successor to the Harry Potter series. In saying that, a few plot holes are irritating me...

With the anti-NoMaj laws, how would that work with NoMaj-born wizards and witches? Obviously the Wizarding Community is going to be exposed to an extent. They can't exactly obliviate every single NoMaj parent of a witch or wizard and they can't exactly not have any NoMaj-borns attend Ilvermony because that would be super controversial. 

How did Newt know that Graves was actually Grindlewald? And what was Grindlewald using to masquerade as Graves? Was it Polyjuice Potion or a spell? Who was the real Graves and why was he specifically targeted by Grindlewald (no doubt this last part will be explained by HRH Queen JK eventually) 

Assuming it's the same system as Hogwarts - surely a representative would have approached Credence to tell him he's a Wizard and has a place at Ilvermorny if he wanted to attend. Since he was surrounded by NoMajs and would have no knowledge of the Wizarding community. If someone from the school or government had just sat him down and told him he was a wizard they'd have saved everyone a WHOLE lot of bother.

2038,emceeyoung,1481696454,"On my second viewing, I noticed something about Newt that suggests a deeper and sadder backstory than the film lets on. 

Notice how, every time someone brings up Leta Lestrange (Queenie, Tina), Newt at first acts like he has no idea who they're talking about. Especially with Tina just before he leaves, he seems to have no idea how to answer Tina's question about Leta and whether or not she reads. In the moment, it plays like he's just being British and rather private about the whole thing, like it's too painful and he doesn't want to talk about it... but I think there's something else going on. 

This is a man who keeps a swooping evil in his pocket, one of the few beasts that lives in his coat and not his suitcase. A man who's testing the venom of the swooping evil at different dilutions to see if it can erase bad memories. Imagine that little detail is more than just a convenient plot device.

And how is that legal in the wizarding world? Why did Voldemort not take advantage of that to sneak into hogwarts?) 

For the most part, I just assume these things can be explained away or will be explained away. I have faith. 

But I cannot for the love of Merlin's beard get past the obliviative rain. 

How could it have possibly cleared the memory of every single person in New York? I get that they made a point with showing how it got into the water supply (showers and water glass) but that's the most inefficient way to go about it.. in my opinion. 

And even wizards are able to be obliviated, as we well know. Yet there were wizards working for MACUSA just strolling through the rain fixing the decimated city. How were they not affected?? Yeah, they were wearing hats, but it was New York in the 1920's, so muggles probably were too.

I noticed something that stood out to me and I thought others who are far smarter than I in these matters would be able to answer my question.

[Spoilers Ahead!]

[My observation came to when Grinddelwald was revealed at the end. I noticed, as others have, that he was not using the Elder Wand. I believe we all can agree that he did possess the Wand as it showed him taking it as a youth in the Deathly Hallows.](/spoiler)

[What interested me was that Tina disarmed him before he was captured. Wouldn't the rules of possession of the Elder Wand, as stated in the Deathly Hallows, say that Tina became the master of the Wand after disarming its master? We see this happen when Draco disarms Dumbledore in The Halfblood Prince and again when Harry rips a generic Wand from Draco's hand in the Deathly Hallows. By this reasoning, since Tina disarmed Grindlewald, even from a normal wand, the Elder Wand would have given its allegiance to Tina.](/spoiler)

[So either this is a large inconsistency in the plot or it is intended which means Grindlewald would need to defeat Tina at a later time.](/spoiler)

Thoughts?

Secondly,  imagine if he had been left in the orphanage and how strong of an obscure he would have become

Thirdly ... I guess this links up to why when Harry asks Dumbledore what he would have done if he knew that the boy Tom would grow up to be the most evil wizard of all time, he would probably have had to kill him, because he couldn't just leave young Tom

And finally, I guess Harry would have become and obscure too because his family punished him for being magical and were trying to suppress him... luckily he was the chosen one and Hagrid had to save him anyways ",FantasticBeasts,Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/5dyrqa/thoughts/,1479630806.0

2136,marshmally,1479056494,"I walked in to Fantastic Beasts a little disenchanted but really expecting to like it more than Cursed Child, which I'd rate at a a solid C+ or B- (I saw Cursed Child in London, did not read the screenplay). And while I hate saying this, I found myself unable to clap at the end credits of Fantastic Beasts because . . . I actually really hated it.

(I'm surprised to use the word hated for this film btw.)

JK Rowling in the flesh was amazing, definitely got teary eyed. She is so beautiful and lovely and okay I was more than teary eyed, I sobbed. 

Ultimately, however, FB suffered from the same things I disliked in CC—in short, it needs a HEAVY edit. Many scenes, characters, lines should have been cut. Way too long. The POV kept changing and wasn't really explained. There were MANY plot points together at once, and none of them stood out/were particularly interesting. Also, it was really hard to tell all the white men apart. Just saying. I had to be like, ""oh, this white guy is the senator, this white guy is the senator's father."" Which I'm not even sure why they had the senator subplot or characters in the first place . . . took up a good half hour of the film for nothing.

Some issues with HP canon, though minor compared to CC. (i.e.: If Newt was kicked out of Hogwarts, why didn't they break his wand??)

Actor-wise: Eddie Redmayne is what you'd expect. He is good, but Newt Scamander honestly isn't super likeable. I disliked Tina Goldstein. There was nothing interesting about her. We know they get married (it says so in the HP series) but I can't think of two characters/actors who have less chemistry than Newt and Tina. The no-maj, Kowalski, was fine. He had some funny lines but nothing felt OUTSTANDING, and there was some fat shaming for him that is simply not okay in 2016. By far and away Alison Sudol as Queenie was the best. Queenie was the most interesting of the characters and the most that I could actually see in the world. Also enjoyed the president of MACUSA. And the niffler. Everyone LOVED the niffler. I loved the niffler. In fact, had this film just been Queenie and the niffler it would have been my favorite thing.

Ezra Miller's character Credence and his story was fascinating, but there was way too much backstory that wasn't properly shown. (I get what the backstory was, but I feel like an abused child should warrant more emotion than it did. And I didn't understand anything with this adopted sister. I'm sure she'll be back in a subsequent film but it was way too much to deal with that didn't make sense). And then like, as quick as Credence became interesting, it was over with. Odd choice.

Other issues I took with the film: DIVERSITY. You just can't have Harlem in 1920 with all white people. You can't.

JOHNNY DEPP. Why in the world did they cast a man who beat his wife in this?!? Did they not have a better option?

PREDICTABILITY. One of the greatest strengths of the HP series is how everything comes together seamlessly. Unsure if maybe I'm older, or the fact I work in children's publishing, or what, but I correctly guessed on EVERY occasion what would happen.

CGI was Star Wars prequels levels of bad, in that it was okay, but wayyyyy too much. In fact much of this felt very Star Wars prequels to me. She's completely George Lucas'ing herself. 

Also, the movie doesn't set itself up for a next one at the end. So I have no idea where they're gonna go with this?? Someone help because I truly want to understand. It's just odd.

Overall: Hard plot to follow, unlikeable characters, generally not interesting. I'd see it, but when you can rent it from Amazon or iTunes for $3.",FantasticBeasts,[Spoilers] My review of Fantastic Beasts from the NYC Lumos Benefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/5cqt7h/spoilers_my_review_of_fantastic_beasts_from_the/,1479027694.0
