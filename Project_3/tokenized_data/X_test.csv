1710,potterless a fresh take on the books and a reality check for what we dismissed/glossed over being swept up in the magic of the universe as children since some time i have been listening to the potterless podcast r/potterless when i am walking to work and it s been great it s funny a great recap to the books and the series and it s also a great way to understand how certain parts elements and characters hold up throughout time and from the perspective of an adult having read the books as children and then understanding them with the broadened worldview and a better appreciation of the darker elements of the books and the flaws of several characters i would recommend everyone to listen to it and challenge your own notions about characters plots events etc the podcast gives you an opportunity to hear a fresh take on the books from an unbiased standpoint other than when quidditch is mentioned the most hilarious rants ensue but it also discusses the practical issues with the magical world draws parallels to our reality and world around us at the end of the day humans in the wizarding world are essentially like humans in the real world the principles of behaviour and interactions are the same especially for people who try and justify snape or james or sirius or any other widely and passionately disputed character these three characters for me have been the most complex and often problematic characters snape s behaviour being the most unacceptable my opinion don t come at me with justifications for his behaviours there are no justifications for being so emotionally abusive to children as an adult to the point where you become their greatest fear also i don't want the comments to turn into an argument james and sirius are also incredibly problematic in many parts of the narrative this is also discussed unabashedly and without any inclination to defend them with bias as are several other characters dumbledore percy etc even harry and of course the obvious terrible people like umbridge whether you agree with the opinions or not that is up to you but it is still a great listen and a fresh perspective that you can ponder over enjoy all things

children.     Since some time I have been listening to the Potterless podcast (r/potterless) when I am walking to work, and it’s been great. It’s funny, a great recap to the books and the series, and it’s also a great way to understand how certain parts, elements, and characters hold up throughout time and from the perspective of an adult.   Having read the books as children, and then understanding them with the broadened worldview and a better appreciation of the darker elements of the books and the flaws of several characters. I would recommend everyone to listen to it, and challenge your own notions about characters, plots, events etc.  The podcast gives you an opportunity to hear a fresh take on the books from an unbiased standpoint (other than when Quidditch is mentioned – the most hilarious rants ensue!!). But it also discusses the practical issues with the magical world, draws parallels to our reality and world around us. At the end of the day, humans in the wizarding world are essentially like humans in the real world, the principles of behaviour and interactions are the same.   Especially for people who try and justify Snape, or James, or Sirius, or any other widely and passionately disputed character. These three characters for me have been the most complex and often problematic characters. Snape’s behaviour being the most unacceptable (my opinion, don’t come at me with justifications for his behaviours, there are no justifications for being so emotionally abusive to children as an adult to the point where you become their greatest fear! Also, I don't want the comments to turn into an argument.)   James and Sirius are also incredibly problematic, in many parts of the narrative, this is also discussed unabashedly and without any inclination to defend them with bias. As are several other characters (Dumbledore, Percy, etc, even Harry!) And of course the obvious terrible people like Umbridge.   Whether you agree with the opinions or not, that is up to you, but it is still a great listen, and a fresh perspective that you can ponder over.   & #   Enjoy all things violently purple,  The intense sport discussions  And amazing guests who make the conversations ever so enjoyable."

It is well established that the pronunciation of a spell is very important (it’s LeviOsa not LevioSA). Just imagine being a Yorkshire or a Scouse wizard - the amount of backfiring spells would be horrific.  I can understand wizarding communities developing accents conducive to successful spell casting but you have to feel for muggle-borns!

Someone on reddit said one day, that he thinks, time travel will be a big deal in CoG because the word ""time"" is used several times in the trailer and we hear a clicking clock. I've watched the movie and we see a lot of clocks, but nobody is talking about time travel.   Then I see Grindelwald and Dumbledore. They are nearly the same age, right? But Dumbledore looks good in 1929, while Grindelwald looks much older - and whats wrong with his eye?   So maybe he traveled time?! That would explain why he looks older and more used and why he knows the stuff, that happens in the 40s in Europe and Nagasaki...  ##   & #"

Important to note he takes a very anti-muggle statement here and people with these beleves usually tend to be against muggle-magic relations.  And he says ""don't WE all die just a LITTLE""  WE for me means all wizards and LITTLE as in just a bit (but duh no shit)  I think he means that muggle make the Wizarding blood less pure and so the pure blood 'die a little' since it slowly decase with the mix of more and more Muggle-wizard relationships until evrryone will become, after some point, half bloods if not more muggleborn than half blood.  Grindelwald wanted wizards to be superior to muggles and for them to rule over the muggle world, I think that he'd also be against their cross relationship if one were to rule and be superior to the other.  (Bassicaly they would be slaves that can't be associated with the pure (and less pure) wizards)."

Hey  guys, I've been thinking about the end of the movie, where it is said  that Credence is Albus brother, but for me it makes no sense.  So I  tought, is it possible that Credence is actualy Albus nephew? I mean, I  know Ariana was only 14 at the time of her death, but we see plenty of  girls getting pregnant at this age so it is possible, and there is the 3  muggles that beat her up (that's why albus father was sent to Azkaban).  So maybe Creedence, or Aurelius, is the product of a rape and that is  why he was given away.  A baby conceived  of rape was concidered a shameful thing to a family and we know that  wizards are very conservative in the 1980's, so imagine it in the 19th  century.  Btw, I never posted in here before, so if I did something wrong let me know :)"

We went from Credence Barebone to Corvus Lestrange V to Aurelius Dumbledore. How that works out since mr.(brian?) Dumbledore died in azkaban when albus was quite young and kendra (mom) died when albus was in his late teens and movie jude law dumbledore is quite a bit older this puzzles me.  The thing about all the names and identities and infantcide surrounding credence reminds me of a character from the mortal instruments. It is a book series based on harry potter (main character is a girl name clary..) which has been arpund for 10 years. In the story there is another character who almost has a new ""true"" identity/name every book along with a lot of false ones, switching babies etc. This reminded me greatly of what they are doing with credence now."

I  think her character would be more interesting would she be placed in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, with all the elitists and bullies, being a 'mudblood' and a part of a golden trio at the same time. It wouldn't be unnatural for her personality and  would make the whole acceptance of differences conflict more dimensional, in terms of Harry and Ron befriending a Slytherin girl as well. What do you think?"

I personally think Harry and Hermione would have been a much better couple. I tend to go for couples that have different personalities but Ron and Hermione are WAY too different and argue a lot. Harry and Hermione are different enough to balance each other out but similar enough to get along and tend to respect and learn from each other more. Ron get's very jealous and likes to copy from Hermione's work or beg her to do some of his assignments while Hermione is very judgemental of him sometimes. Like the fact that he loves to eat. lol Even J.K Rowling has admitted that she made them canon as a sort of wish fulfillment and thinks that the two would need marriage counseling. Emma Watson has even said that she believes Ron would not have been able to make Hermione happy. When I was younger, I always expected Harry and Hermione to end up together."

Lately, I’ve been very curious about a hypothetical. Let’s say right after Hagrid leaves him at Kings Cross, he is suddenly sucked into an alternate dimension. He is gone, leaving no trace.  How does everyone react and what would they do? Is the Wizarding World truly doomed without Harry Potter? What would Dumbledore do now that Harry is missing? Would Voldemort be able to accomplish all his goals? I’m very curious. What do you guys think?"

I just read the script again (probably even better the second time) I'll probably watch the movie again soon and I get the feeling I might appreciate it more.  I just finished reading the published script for Crimes of Grindelwald and I was kind of let down, mostly because I got confused during it. But it might have been because I stopped reading it in the middle for awhile. I'll probably watch the movie soon.  But I actually really like reading these stories in movie script form. Did you any of you read the published scripts for both Fantastic Beasts movies?"

wasn't a big hobby of mine but this april i read the first book and i loved it j k rowling did a fantastic job which you can't appreciate just by watching the movies i'm now finishing the  book which at the moment is my favourite yesterday i was in my the living room watching the tv when somebody knocked on the door i went to open it and there was a man standing in front of me he was at least  years old and he was wearing some old fashioned clothes i stared at him for a few seconds when he said in spanish with an english accent that he was looking for me and my family he said our surname i don't know why but i didn't felt in danger letting him into my house i asked him to take a sit on the couch while i went to get my dad my mom wasn't home my dad sat in front of the man with a strange look on his face then the guy told me if he could speak in english because he felt more confident speaking in english i'm not a perfect english speaker but i can understand and have a conversation fluently winth another person so i told him i would do my best to traduce everything to my dad the man told us his name he was arthur abraham gladstone and he came to tell my family and i that i was a wizard i was speechless i remembered everything from the hp movies and the books i had read but couldn't think of a possibility that that was real so i traduced it to my dad and he just stared at him for a few seconds and told me to ask him if he was joking my father is not a fan of hp but he knows what it is so he knew that it seemed like it the man said that he came from augront a school for wizards and witches he proceded to grab what i can only describe as a wand and pointed it to a candle we have in front of the couch the candle started floating me and my father stared at each other and an image of hermione doing the wingardium leviosa spell popped into my mind i just said what the man told me i was a wizard and that augront wanted me to go to their school it is a public school and i just need to pay for the books and the school suplies he told me i had to go to platting square to get my suplies and that school started on the  of september i was surprised because he refered

would gladli answer them,"THIS IS IMPORTANT Before I start, I have to apologize for my English, it's not my first language.  So something happened yesterday and I just opened this account to tell you what it is.   Ok, so my name is Marc and I'm from Spain. I didn't care about Harry Potter until February of 2018, when I watched all 8 movies because I felt the need to. I didn't want to read the books because I don't usually read and it wasn't a big hobby of mine. But this April I read the first book and I loved it, J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job which you can't appreciate just by watching the movies. I'm now finishing the 4th book which at the moment is my favourite.   Yesterday, I was in my the living room watching the TV when somebody knocked on the door. I went to open it and there was a man standing in front of me. He was at least 60 years old, and he was wearing some old fashioned clothes. I stared at him for a few seconds when he said, in Spanish with an English accent, that he was looking for me and my family (he said our surname).  I don't know why but I didn't felt in danger letting him into my house. I asked him to take a sit on the couch while I went to get my dad (my mom wasn't home). My dad sat in front of the man with a strange look on his face. Then the guy told me if he could speak in English because he felt more confident speaking in English. I'm not a perfect English speaker but I can understand and have a conversation fluently winth another person. So I told him I would do my best to traduce everything to my dad. The man told us his name. He was Arthur Abraham Gladstone and he came to tell my family and I that I was a wizard. I was speechless, I remembered everything from the HP movies and the books I had read but couldn't think of a possibility that that was real. So I traduced it to my dad and he just stared at him for a few seconds and told me to ask him if he was joking (my father is not a fan of HP but he knows what it is so he knew that it seemed like it). The man said that he came from Augront, a school for wizards and witches. He proceded to grab what I can only describe as a wand and pointed it to a candle we have in front of the couch. The candle started floating. Me and my father stared at each other and an image of Hermione doing the Wingardium Leviosa spell popped into my mind. I just said ""What!?""  The man told me I was a wizard and that Augront wanted me to go to their school. It is a public school and I just need to pay for the books and the school suplies. He told me, I had to go to ""Platting Square"" to get my suplies, and that school started on the 1st of September.   I was surprised because he refered to muggles as muggles so I thought that J.K. Rowling maybe knew this existed...  I asked a lot of questions to Arthur. But here are the ones that might interest you the most.   * Me: But doesn't the school start at 11 years old? (I'm 17, 18 in about 2 moths).  Arthur: No, it starts when you're 18.  * Me: I've never experienced anithing abnormal or ""magical"", why I'm a wizard?  Arthur: You don't have to experience something, usually, magical manifestations are very subtle, and most of the time    you don't notice them.  * Me: Where is Augront located?  Arthur: Scotland, you get there by train, just like in the HP movies.  * Me: Is the magical world a secret?  Arthur: No it isn't. It's just hidden from the muggle eye.  * Me: Why J.K. Rowling wrote the books?  Arthur: She did it to help muggles to become wizards by having faith that the HP universe existed. We needed more    muggles on our school so we had to create the story to select the muggles that had a wizard-like mind from the    ordinary muggles.  * Me: Are there ""real wizards""?  Arthur: We just call them wizards. But yes. They are wizards with parents whom are wizards.  & #   My conclusion is that if you really want to go to the real Hogwarts, there is a chance that you can. Since I watched the first movie, I just had a hidden obssession about becoming a wizard, and I believed that it existed. I know a lot of you feel the same way, so don't give up, because it's true!  I have a lot more answers. But I'm a bit tired. If you have any questions, just let me know and I would gladly answer them."

I’ve taken Pottermore quizzes a million times before, and always choose the same or similar answers, and I always get Hufflepuff. Oddly enough, this time it was quite firmly Gryffindor. I found this a bit confusing, and got onto another quiz with all the Pottermore questions, picked the exact same answers, and was firmly back in Hufflepuff. Anyone had similar experiences?   Also the quiz in question changes a couple of things, such as simplifying the Dragon pox/Merlin’s book/student records question and adding one about a path leading to the sea, a forest or a castle, which I don’t recognise."

He’s clearly incredibly powerful and an alchemist (allusion to Aurelius which means gold) - plus we know JK Rowling infuses meaning into her characters’ names. He also created the Philosopher’s Stone which has the power to ‘restore life’ so would he have the power to maybe create a life too? Say in theory Dumbledore and Flamel wanted to create a wizard who could take down Grindelwald should he get too powerful they could have used some of Dumbledore’s DNA - so he would have powerful blood and it explains the Phoenix. Plus I saw someone on here saying maybe Dumbledore or Grindelwald captured the Obscurial from Ariana when she died - so if we entertain that theory and say Dumbledore somehow took it and passed it on to Credence (maybe even accidentally).   We also know that as loveable as Dumbledore is, he is a very complex multi-faceted character who is prepared to go to extremes to defeat dark magic - ie raising Harry knowing he would get killed and also AD was involved in the killing of Ariana so we know he is far from perfect.  This is admittedly hugely unlikely, but it’s a theory that would explain everything (I think) and explains why Nicolas Flamel has been introduced into the storyline.   Further, he knows that he can’t fight Grindelwald because of the blood pact, which is a dilemma because he’s the only one who was powerful enough to. Him and Flamel together could’ve thought that they could’ve created a wizard so great that they could control the obscurion.  EDIT: also Credence’s evil adopted mother is called ‘Mrs Barebone’ - reference to perhaps him being created from a bare bone"

2652,in defense of slytherin or why you should never judge people based on their house a lot of people associate slytherins with evil and that might be true for the characters in the books but i think it s time we start to draw a line between book slytherins and fans that are slytherins and point out how different those two things are in the books slytherins are written to be bad guys jk rowling made them that way of course they are literally the worst possible verions of slytherins when someone created them that way the thing is fans who get sorted in to slytherin can get a lot of shit for it and this needs to stop people in the real world have more dimension than characters in these books jk rowling didn t create her fans they are all different people with different backgrounds who just happen to be sorted in to slytherin and what actually defines a slytherin cunning and ambitious thats what s stated on pottermore does these personality traits make people evil no so then why are so many peole hating on fans that are slytherin ofcourse there is a lot of real life slytherins who are assoles but assoholes exist from every house i think there is a side to the slytherin house that is very underrepresented the part of slytherin i and a lot of my friend belong to i am not ambitious i always thaught i would be a hufflepuff my ilvermorny house is pukwudgie the house of heart and healers and i could never understand why pottermore put me in slytherin over and over again i really couldn t identify with the house untill a few years ago there is a way to be slytherin without the ambition part its all about being smart in the lazy kind of way like people who use their brains to find shortcuts or simple solutions to problems ravenclaw is usually seen as the smart house but they are a lot of the times more booksmart and study alot slytherins are the ones who get high grades without a lot of work because they find a way around it you could have that type of personality and the quiz will sort you in to slytherin even tho you might not seem to be one you could be as far away from what people usually consider a slytherin to be and still be one because people tend to forget about the other traits of the house basically just the cunning part wich without ambition becomes the lazy kind of smart i mentioned there are probably more hidden sides to all of the houses that i don t know about and i think that s amazing i just spoke from my perspective as a slytherin and the message i want to send out is that you should never judge or speak badly avout a house in the way

with evil, and that might be true for the characters in the books, but I think it’s time we start to draw a line between book slytherins and fans that are slytherins and point out how different those two things are.   In the books Slytherins are written to be bad guys, JK Rowling made them that way. Of course they are literally the worst possible verions of slytherins when someone created them that way. The thing is, fans who get sorted in to slytherin can get a lot of shit for it, and this needs to stop. People in the real world have more dimension than characters in these books.  JK Rowling didn’t create her fans, they are all different people with different backgrounds who just happen to be sorted in to slytherin. And what actually defines a slytherin? Cunning and ambitious, thats what’s stated on Pottermore. Does these personality traits make people evil, No. So then why are so many peole hating on fans that are slytherin? Ofcourse there is a lot of real life slytherins who are assoles, but assoholes exist from every house.   I think there is a side to the Slytherin house that is very underrepresented, the part of slytherin I and a lot of my friend belong to.  I am not ambitious, I always thaught I would be a hufflepuff, my ilvermorny house is pukwudgie, the house of heart and healers, and I could never understand why Pottermore put me in slytherin over and over again. I really couldn’t identify with the house untill a few years ago.  There is a way to be slytherin without the ambition part. Its all about being smart in the lazy kind of way. Like people who use their brains to find shortcuts or simple solutions to problems. Ravenclaw is usually seen as the smart house, But They are a lot of the times more booksmart and study alot. Slytherins are the ones who get high grades without a lot of work because They find a way around it.   You could have that type of personality and the quiz will sort you in to slytherin even tho you might not seem to be one. You could be as far away from what people usually consider a slytherin to be, and still be one, because people tend to forget about the other traits of the house, basically just the cunning part, wich without ambition becomes the lazy kind of smart i mentioned.

2768,my entry for the owl mail   homework assignment inking's trait upon the age  a witch or wizard will have the choice to have a painless ministry approved spell put upon them that leaves them with a temporary marking similar to a muggle's tattoo of a bound scroll the scroll shall be horizontally lined along with said person's wrist with a black ribbon binding it this spell will also allow them to write messages to those with the same marking in a secretive manner to write the message you need to dip the writing utensil in question in salamander's blood whether quill or pen once you sign your name at the bottom of the message the salamander's blood will automatically vanish from the quill or pen along with all that you had written but this will only work if you have gone through the spell's effects otherwise the blood will stay there and the message left written in plain sight the person who is intended to receive the message will have the ribbon that binds the scroll on their wrist turn a shade of red if they touch the marking with the tip of their wand the scroll will unravel itself to reveal the message once the person is done reading the message they can tap it again and the scroll will go back to its previous state but the message will have been erased and the ribbon black once more the same will take effect if a muggle or non wizard enters the room in which the witch or wizard is reading the message where it will roll back at twice the speed and cannot be opened again unless the muggle has left in the event of being caught by a muggle the wizard or witch in question can simply state that they drew it themselves once this statement is proclaimed the scroll will then wash away when made contact with water for the next  hour period the next day the scroll will reappear in the same spot once at the age of  a witch or wizard can have the spell redone to where it will not wash off upon contact with water and will instead be seen as a simple muggle tattoo

els ha the same mark they can simpli utter thi phrase to discreetli tell them that they have a messag i cannot think straight,"My Entry for the Owl Mail 2.0 Homework Assignment **\~ Inking's Trait \~**  Upon the age 12, a witch or wizard will have the choice to have a painless Ministry-Approved spell put upon them that leaves them with a temporary marking (similar to a muggle's tattoo) of a bound scroll. The scroll shall be horizontally lined along with said person's wrist, with a black ribbon binding it. This spell will also allow them to write messages to those with the same marking in a secretive manner.  To write the message, you need to dip the writing utensil in question in salamander's blood (whether quill or pen). Once you sign your name at the bottom of the message, the salamander's blood will automatically vanish from the quill or pen, along with all that you had written. But this will only work if you have gone through the spell's effects. Otherwise the blood will stay there, and the message left written in plain sight.  The person who is intended to receive the message will have the ribbon that binds the scroll on their wrist turn a shade of red. If they touch the marking with the tip of their wand, the scroll will unravel itself to reveal the message. Once the person is done reading the message, they can tap it again, and the scroll will go back to its previous state. But the message will have been erased, and the ribbon black once more. The same will take effect if a muggle or Non-Wizard enters the room in which the witch or wizard is reading the message, where it will roll back at twice the speed, and cannot be opened again unless the muggle has left.  In the event of being caught by a muggle, the wizard or witch in question can simply state that they drew it themselves. Once this statement is proclaimed, the scroll will then wash away when made contact with water for the next 24-hour period. The next day, the scroll will reappear in the same spot.  Once at the age of 18, a witch or wizard can have the spell redone to where it will not wash off upon contact with water, and will instead be seen as a simple muggle tattoo. If a nearby witch or wizard notices that someone else has the same mark, they can simply utter this phrase to discreetly tell them that they have a message: ""I cannot think straight."""

I always wondered why he never said the muggle in question was his cousin who he lives with and knows that he is a wizard?

Here's a witch who'd fight for what she believes is right and go on unapproved adventures because she doesn't want a desk job, just like Newt. I think from the moment Tina dejectedly lead Newt from the auror's place to her less exciting and quite stale Wand Permit Office (full of desks), he felt at least a sense of empathy or understanding for her position. They weren't immediately friends but I think that connection was at least there.  Kudos really to J. K. Rowling."

It's not convoluted, But there isn't a Larger mystery in this one, rather, several different mysteries and subplots all at once, and if I were to describe it, I'd say it's about Harry's relationship with everyone and everything around him, and how it's changing."

HE WASNT POWERFUL ENOUGH. I get he was emotionally tough and stronger than Voldemort in that aspect, but I mean raw power. I wanted Harry to go into DH and actually let me believe he can stand a chance against Voldemort in a duel. That’s why he and Voldemort didn’t actually have a full on duel at the end of the book, there was no way Harry would have actually stood a chance. On a different note, earlier in the series they always said Harry was special and gifted. He was the top in defense against the dark arts and could produce a patronus at a young age, but that’s where his power stopped. He even admitted time and time again that Hermione was far better at magic. It’s not crazy to think that in a duel with Voldemort she would fair better than Harry. I love Harry Potter but this has always bothered me, I just wish that if the series is about him then he should be an extraordinary wizard."

I've just retaken the Pottermore Sorting quiz... three times. I'm a lifelong, legitimately sorted Gryffindor here (not a ""fake"" Gryffindor). I took the original Pottermore quiz years ago and that's what I got. After hearing some chatter about the 2019 updates, I decided to retake the quiz for fun. I had to do so twice because I almost couldn't believe my results. I got Hufflepuff twice in a row. Now, I don't think this is bad. At first I did, but I can sort of understand, after some reading and reflection, why I would be Hufflepuff.   & #   Now, though, I'm fairly certain I could be a classic Hatstall, where the choice comes down to your personal preference. I could see things I would like in either House and Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tend to get on well with each other as well. How do I decide which House I really want to be part of? Does anyone else feel split loyalty to multiple Houses after retaking the Sorting quiz? Share your thoughts and 2019 Sorting Hat experience with us!"

I would see Ironman in Slytherin, because he is definitely cunning and ambitious. Thor I would put into Hufflepuff - he is so loyal to Loki, even after everything that happened. Same with Nebula, she does everything she does out of loyalty to either Thanos or Gamora. And Scarlet Witch - no idea where to put her. Not Ravenclaw though. And not Hufflepuff either.

2355,what gameplay features would you like to see in an open world single player harry potter rpg apparently there was a leak last year about a warner bros harry potter open world rpg i'm not sure if this was an mmo or if it was a single player personally i'd prefer a single player game a la skyrim wb has been proactively removing the leaked footage leading me to believe there may be some merit to this leak there has been an small amount of discussion on this sub regarding the game but the major discussions are archived here's what i imagine for the game feel free to add features you want to see gear wands wands can offer quite a bit of flexibility and potential gameplay mechanics wands are made of different types of wood imbued with different types of magical creature parts and contain varying levels of pliability allowing for a potentially rich and diverse set of equips for your character armor seeing as there's lots of magic in hp enchanted robes and leather suits can offer lots of potential resistances to various kinds of magic pet you can equip a pet and the different types of pets offer different stat bonuses and can aid you in certain ways during battle crafting wand crafting spell crafting and armor enchantments you can collect ingredients like in skyrim and use wand/spell/enchant recipes to develop your own stuff combat everyone is a mage and the combat is purely focused on ranged wand combat with hundreds of spells in your arsenal dangerous magical creatures can do physical damage but your wand can deflect physical damage open world i wasn't sure how you'd make it open world hogwarts isn't that big compared to a large world like skyrim they could make the forbidden forest a place to level up and gain loot and experience gameplay and quests i'm not sure if the game should focus on being a student at hogwarts or if it should focus on something else like being an auror or perhaps both quests can focus on magical creatures dueling exploration where

Apparently there was a leak last year about a Warner Bros Harry Potter open-world RPG. I'm not sure if this was an MMO or if it was a single player. Personally, I'd prefer a single player game a la Skyrim. WB has been proactively removing the leaked footage, leading me to believe there may be some merit to this leak.  There has been an small amount of discussion on this sub regarding the game, but the major discussions are archived. Here's what I imagine for the game, feel free to add features you want to see:  # Gear  **Wands**: Wands can offer quite a bit of flexibility and potential gameplay mechanics. Wands are made of different types of wood, imbued with different types of magical creature parts and contain varying levels of pliability, allowing for a potentially rich and diverse set of equips for your character.  **Armor**: Seeing as there's lots of magic in HP, enchanted robes and leather suits can offer lots of potential resistances to various kinds of magic.  **Pet**: You can ""equip"" a pet, and the different types of pets offer different stat bonuses and can aid you in certain ways during battle.  # Crafting  Wand crafting, spell crafting and armor enchantments. You can collect ingredients (like in Skyrim) and use wand/spell/enchant recipes to develop your own stuff.  # Combat  ""Everyone is a mage"" and the combat is purely focused on ranged wand combat, with hundreds of spells in your arsenal. Dangerous magical creatures can do physical damage, but your wand can deflect physical damage.  # Open-world  I wasn't sure how you'd make it open-world. Hogwarts isn't that big compared to a large world like Skyrim. They could make the forbidden forest a place to level up and gain loot and experience.   # Gameplay and quests  I'm not sure if the game should focus on being a student at Hogwarts, or if it should focus on something else like being an Auror, or perhaps both. Quests can focus on magical creatures, dueling, exploration (where?) and solving mysteries.  Overall, I think there's potential for a game like this and I think lots of people would buy it, but I'm not sure how the gameplay and open-world would work."

all the possible reasons enjoy ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ authority issues ever since his near death by the hand of the aurors of macusa credence certainly holds a grudge against the wizarding administration in america not only because of the attack but also for their failure in finding him in years he may have heard that children in non magic families can be detected by authorities though he may find that since he successfully surpressed his magic for years they may not be responsible nor for not noticing grindelwald s infiltration though there is a chance that he believes they secretly collide with him which i wouldn t put past either also through the attack he may have problems trusting authorities in general now though this is not unfounded credence has endangered the secrecy of the wizarding world killed three no majes and was proven to be almost impossible to control he must know the international wizarding police will try to eliminate him at any cost this was also supported by skender in a deleted scene by the end of the first movie who stressed that he d face a capital punishment if he stayed in america grindelwald s part during the last movie also certainly has added to his paranoia no matter how conscious he was when the dark lord was arrested the story must have circled through magic newspapers everywhere later on how is he supposed to trust anyone s face or anyone who offers his help no matter how convincingly supportive these issues will also make it much harder for strangers like jacob queenie or theseus to approach him but the chance of someone tricking him these ways is only the beginning of his suspicions _________________________________________________________________________________________ official problems i ve mentioned in a previous theory that credence may not trust tina any longer when she tried to calm him down during the last movie he was attacked and at least briefly severely injured he may have misunderstood the situation and especially now that she has joined the auror s division once more think that she seeks to deliver him to authorities upon gaining his trust even if queenie managed to bring back the memory of how she protected him from mary lou will he believe her intentions were good will he believe in this memory at all according to hp wiki he had dreams of the incident after his obliviation but does he believe them or believe them to be tricks another almost similar problem occurs concerning newt during credence journey through europe with circus arcanus fantastic beast and where to find them was published whether he was in england at the right time or the book was translated quickly enough to be mentioned in a newspaper in another country he d need a translator for that but why not there may be many people from different countries at the circus and he certainly wants to keep himself informed especially after grindelwald s escape and he saw a photo of the man he d met in new york a whole new story may have formed in his head and not a good one he knows newt and tina are friends which may make him suspicious in his eyes already but he may have read that newt is working at the beast division in the british ministry of magic he may assume that he was sent to approach him in new york as it is also increasingly public knowledge that he has an astounding talent with magical beasts even highly dangerous ones such as dragons and credence obscurus form comes undeniably close to this he may have concluded that newt has similar orders as tina hence why he would defend him against grindelwald or rather keeping him from recruting the boy especially considering which certainly was mentioned in a newspaper that he is the younger brother of a famous british auror he may also think as a fellow tumblr user stated that the two of them may plan to use his unique powers for their own purposes or maybe that the ministries seek to use him as a human weapon against grindelwald or to harvest his powers so considering all this the group is facing a solid

(theory)  Hi there :)  There is a chance that Credence will probably have a hard time trusting Tina in the upcoming movie … but unfortunately, it likely won’t be just her…   Hope I can sum up all the possible reasons, enjoy 😊   ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________    **Authority issues**  Ever since his near death by the hand of the aurors of MACUSA, Credence certainly holds a grudge against the wizarding administration in America … not only because of the attack, but also for their failure in finding him in years. He may have heard that children in non-magic families can be detected by authorities – though he may find that since he successfully surpressed his magic for years, they may not be responsible … nor for not noticing Grindelwald’s infiltration, though there is a chance that he believes they secretly collide with him (which I wouldn’t put past either).  Also, through the attack, he may have problems trusting authorities in general now – though this is not unfounded. Credence has endangered the secrecy of the wizarding world, killed three no-majes and was proven to be almost impossible to control… he must know the International Wizarding Police will try to eliminate him at any cost. This was also supported by Skender in a deleted scene by the end of the first movie, who stressed that he’d face a capital punishment if he stayed in America.    Grindelwald’s part during the last movie also certainly has added to his paranoia – no matter how conscious he was when the dark lord was arrested, the story must have circled through magic newspapers everywhere later on… how is he supposed to trust anyone’s face? Or anyone who offers his help, no matter how convincingly supportive?  These issues will also make it much harder for strangers like Jacob, Queenie or Theseus to approach him.  But the chance of someone tricking him these ways is only the beginning of his suspicions…   _________________________________________________________________________________________    **Official problems**  I’ve mentioned in a previous theory that Credence may not trust Tina any longer… when she tried to calm him down during the last movie, he was attacked and, at least briefly, severely injured … he may have misunderstood the situation and, especially now that she has joined the auror’s division once more, think that she seeks to deliver him to authorities upon gaining his trust. Even if Queenie managed to bring back the memory of how she protected him from Mary Lou – will he believe her intentions were good? Will he believe in this memory at all?  According to HP wiki, he had dreams of the incident after his obliviation... but does he believe them? Or believe them to be tricks?  Another almost similar problem occurs concerning Newt … during Credence journey through Europe with Circus Arcanus, “Fantastic Beast and where to find them” was published … whether he was in England at the right time or the book was translated quickly enough to be mentioned in a newspaper in another country (he’d need a translator for that, but why not – there may be many people from different countries at the Circus, and he certainly wants to keep himself informed, especially after Grindelwald’s escape) and he saw a photo of the man he’d met in New York, a whole new story may have formed in his head … and not a good one…  He knows Newt and Tina are friends … which may make him suspicious in his eyes already.

How can anyone even get him to listen?  Is there any way he can be convinced?   _________________________________________________________    Because frankly, I can’t wrap my mind around this yet. Maybe Leta will figure out a surprising way, maybe Maledictus will convince him to give them a chance  … or Newt and Tina simply free all the people and creatures from Circus Arcanus to show that they value life over law. But that’s just my headcannon :)  Anyway, what do you think? How is Credence going to join the group on his own accord? Please let me know :)  Thank you very much for reading :)"

Newt and Credence will cross paths again and possibly fight but somehow Credence looses which gives Newt or Dumbledore an opportunity to convince him that Grindelwald is lying about his lineage or something along those lines.  Queenie: Queenie believes Grindelwald's agenda will lead to her and Jacob living happily ever after, but I imagine she will get a rude awakening once she witnesses first hand Grindelwald's methods for achieving his goals. She is definitely not a dark wizard/witch nor do I believe she will become one, so ultimately I think she will betray Grindelwald and sabotage one of his plans when she see's that things are going too far. Maybe Grindelwald captures Tina and forces Queenie to choose between saving/reuniting with her sister or to continue helping his cause so she can inevitably be with Jacob. I know not everybody liked how she was written in this movie but I think they could turn things around with a little tweaking."

And Lupin tells him he thinks the appearance of Voldemort would have made the other students panic but how do they know how Voldemort looks especially a Voldemort that is just a Product of what Harry thinks Voldemort looks like. Maybe Harry would have been so wrong with his picture that even Lupin who might know how Voldemort looks wouldn't recognise him. So I think the students would probably be mostly confused maybe a few smart one would figure out why Harry is afraid of a seemingly random creepy looking guy.

1009,tried my hand at some fan fiction maybe you guys will like hello all so i decided out of sheer boredome to write some harry potter fan fiction would love some critique on my writing essentially this takes place after the downfall of voldemort a muggle named camus plume working under the auspices of the us government has discovered that the wizarding world exists and is tasked with understanding magic and weaponizing it on behalf of the us government the following are excerpts surrounding his studies of the nature of dementors and the mechanism by which basilisk eyes petrify their victims any feedback and revealing of plot holes/inconsistencies is much appreciated feel free to add any ideas you may have too and my grammar is atrocius and im too lazy to edit on the discovery of a dementor lure a dementors effects cannot be completely staved off but they can be resisted through muggle technology to the point where studying them will not place the scientist into a state of existential crisis enchanted seretonin and dopamine were discovered to function as a dementor lure of sorts the mechanism of action is not yet fully understood but the following procedure achieved success in bending the foul creatures to our will begin by first isolating highly pure sources of human extracted seretonin and dopamine dementors will not respond to seretonin and dopamine harvested from non human animals this was one of the main reasons they could not detect sirius black in animagus form placing this extraction in a highly concentrated and as of yet classified gelatinous suspension infused with theobromine one of the main ingredients in chocolate and blasting this concoction with repeated blasts of the patronus charm under standard temperature and pressure creates an elixir which renders the dementors compliant and eager to do the bidding of whomever possesses a vial of the elixir it should be noted that not just any patronus charm will do the patronus must be cast by a sufficiently powerful wizard picked by the sorting hat to the house of slytherin by virtue of the fact that the wizards power level was measured by the hat to be  necrojoules or higher necrojoules being the unit of measurement discovered by camus plume to correlate with the amount of dark wizarding energy wizards were innately born with the opposite being vivijoules every wizard has magical energy that can be measured in vivijoules or necrojoules meaning every wizard can potentially turn to the dark arts if they so choose however only wizards of sufficient necrojoules can become extremely powerful dark wizards the cutoff point for how many necrojoules a wizard must posses to be able to become an extremely powerful dark wizard is not yet known but it is known that no extremely powerful dark wizard has ever possessed a necrojoule level of less than  lord voldemort in fear that a situation very much like the incident with the boy who lived may have occurred

the ability to create polyjuice potions for any of his death eaters in this way a death eater knew that he could be framed for any number of crimes if they chose to betray the dark lord camus plume

Any feedback and revealing of plot holes/inconsistencies is much appreciated, feel free to add any ideas you may have too.  And my grammar is atrocius and im too lazy to edit...  **ON THE DISCOVERY OF A DEMENTOR LURE**  A dementors effects cannot be completely staved off.  But they can be resisted through muggle technology to the point where studying them will not place the scientist into a state of existential crisis.  Enchanted seretonin and dopamine were discovered to function as a dementor “lure” of sorts.  The mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, but the following procedure achieved success in bending the foul creatures to our will.   Begin by first isolating highly pure sources of human extracted seretonin and dopamine  (dementors will not respond to seretonin and dopamine harvested from non human animals, this was one of the main reasons they could not detect Sirius black in animagus form)   placing this extraction in a highly concentrated and as of yet classified gelatinous suspension, infused with theobromine (one of the main ingredients in chocolate) and blasting this concoction with repeated blasts of the patronus charm under standard temperature and pressure creates an elixir which renders the dementors compliant and eager to do the bidding of whomever possesses a vial of the elixir.    It should be noted that not just any patronus charm will do. The patronus must be cast by a sufficiently powerful wizard picked by the sorting hat to the house of slytherin by virtue of the fact that the wizards power level was measured by the hat to be 700 necrojoules or higher.    Necrojoules being the unit of measurement discovered by Camus plume to correlate with the amount of “dark” wizarding energy wizards were innately born with.   The opposite being vivijoules.  Every wizard has magical energy that can be measured in vivijoules or necrojoules, meaning every wizard can potentially turn to the dark arts if they so choose, however only wizards of sufficient necrojoules can become extremely powerful dark wizards.    The cutoff point for how many necrojoules a wizard must posses to be able to become an extremely powerful dark wizard is not yet known but it is known that no extremely powerful dark wizard has ever possessed a necrojoule level of less than 600.     Lord Voldemort, in fear that a situation very much like the incident with the boy who lived may have occurred before his initial downfall made a prodigious store of his blood and instructed one of his faithful servants who was able to infiltrate st mungos to secrete it in one of the blood banks of wizard blood they kept there for transfusions.     Voldemort also kept a meticulous store of blood, as well as skin hair and saliva of his death eaters for various purposes, the most important of which was to have the ability to create polyjuice potions for any of his death eaters.  In this way, a death eater knew that he could be framed for any number of crimes if they chose to betray the dark lord.    Camus plume discovered these stores of blood and body solids/fluids and measured the necrojoule values of lord voldemort and his death eaters.  Voldemort, not surprisingly, had the highest necrojoule value of any dark wizard ever tested and currently remains the only dark wizard to achieve a necrojoule value exceeding 1000, he also had a vivijoule value exceeding 900.  Interestingly severus snape had a relatively low necrojoule value of 650.   The values of all of the dark lords death eaters will be included in an upcoming brief.  needless to say these are matters of the highest classification and are deemed top secret at the highest levels.  Any individual releasing this information to wizards or muggles alike will be prosecuted for high treason.    **On the properties of the Basilisk Eye**  Upon discovering the petrifying qualities of indirect basilisk gaze exposure, the military set about isolating what confers this petrifying effect.  The exact effect is not yet completely understood but it has been discovered that the gaze must be held for a period of time ranging from one to three seconds.  Persons with different genetic makeup seem to display a sort of resistance to the petrifying effect, but as of yet, no individual has displayed complete immunity to basilisk gaze.    In a series of extremely unethical tests which almost certainly violate the nuremberg codes dictates on human experimentation, Camus Reggy Plume, the first muggle to ever fashion a working wand from completely unmagical means, collaborated with the us governments (MUM) (muggle understanding of magic) department and took persons of both muggle and magical descent of every conceivable background and subjected them to rounds of basilisk gaze of both the direct and indirect kind.   This resulted in 500 individuals dying as a result of direct basilisk gaze and 2000 individuals being petrified against their will and experimented on before being resuscitated via the mandrake method.  Persons of every known racial background as well as persons of mixed racial background were walked into a 10 X 10 foot room manacled and blindfolded, and then subjected to the gaze of a surgically removed basilisk eye.  It appears that the basilisk gaze is not effective in anything other than the visible spectrum of light. This was established by muggle advances In technologies for restoring the sight to to the blind, the us military found itself in the habit of trawling orphanages and “adopting” blind children, who were then secreted away to military facilities and fashioned with a state of the art retinal gene therapy that made the child’s eyes unable to see light on the visible spectrum, but able to perfectly see light of the infrared and ultraviolet variety.    These children were then subjected to the gaze of the basilisk to no effect.     A peculiar thing happened when the basilisks, (who now numbered in the thousands due to the government breeding programs) saw for the first time ever that what they fixed their terrible gaze upon didn’t immediately die or become petrified.  They became relatively pliant, docile, and for all intents and purposes domesticated, but only to the individuals that received the gene therapy.    Similar protection against the basilisk gaze was achieved via outfitting individuals with temporary basilisk gaze immunity by wearing infrared or ultraviolet goggles, but the basilisks would not enter into a placid docile state for these individuals...."

But after watching it a second time....good lord I love this film.  The opening sequence might be my favorite opening of any Potter film, alongside DH Part 1. The movie had an overall dark and beliebeable tone to it! It felt a hopeless, insecure. Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is phenomenal, and so is Jude Law as Dumbledore.   The music is incredible. I especially noticed the music during the mirror scene with Dumbledore. It was extremely fitting and well made there.   The conflicts felt...real. Many people say they didn't understand Queene's decisions in this movie. I however was totally on board with her character. She loves Jacob so much, she wants to be with him and is pretty much fooling herself by enchanting him. She's scared, confused, and angry at the world and how it is. And when Grindelwald ""agrees"" with her and offers a change - a change that allows her and Jacob to be free - in the world with a very convincing speech, I totally understand her. Especially when Grindelwald plays on fear and what the muggles will do unless they protect themselves.   I overall love this move and I'm seing it again for the 3rd time this weekend :)"

I've been thinking a lot about Credence actually being Dumbledore's brother but I can't make it work in my mind. I'm of the mind that Percival perished in Azkaban well before Kendra died so I don't really see how he could have had another child, whether by Kendra or by another woman, around 1899-1901.  Although the Credence's-Obscurus-is-Ariana's theory sounded really silly to me at first, and still kinda does, I hope it turns out to be true. I really just want the Dumbledore family to remain as it is; there's no need for a bastard half brother.  Anyway, if Credence does turn out to be just a figurative brother or not a brother at all, which family do you all think he'll belong to? One we've already heard of? Will he somehow end up being revealed to be Corvus Lestrange despite what went down in CoG? Will he be a nobody? A random muggleborn?"

Just a rant It's not often that I see fellow HP nerds on OLD, especially in the 30s crowd. Until I saw the profile of a guy who was a Hufflepuff, wore HP clothes, even played Quidditch. We chatted a bit, seemed to hit it off. Until... nothing. He stopped messaging, didn't reply to anything anymore.  So here's to you, douchebag: are you sure about your Sorting? I get that loyalty is too much to ask after a week of texting, but you can apply some honesty. Despite the 'Puffs reputation, they are not cowards.  I really wanted to ask him if he was related to the Fat Friar, because that's the only other Hufflepuff ghost I know. Thought of that after I blocked him of course...  Sorry, just had to rant a bit."

Take for example the Whomping Willow - a powerful tree that will attempt to kill any and everyone via heavy bludgeoning if anyone get slightly within striking distance of the thing. The tree clearly has no actual protections (aside from the sturdiness that comes with being a tree), so a half-competent wizard could fight back to protect themselves, but then damaging the tree would probably yield punishment.     The faculty is clearly aware of this and highly competent (being able to create a barrier that can stop and incinerate an entire Dark Wizard and monster army, save Voldemort, around the entire school, or prevent all teleportation spells), so any of them could easily just enchant the area around the tree to repel people from getting close, or turning the ground itself into the same consistency of a safety net so anyone hit wouldn't have the second collision to worry about, the latter which could also be applied to Quidditch, which regularly causes weeks or months-long stays at the hospital wing.     It would be slightly more understandable if Hogwarts was more of a university, with competent, reasonable adult students who *probably* won't do something that highly violates common sense, but exposing dangers to 11-year olds without any proactive measures to ensure nobody gets hurt is rather short-sighted, to say the least. Particularly when powerful wizard families can successfully demand that a potentially dangerous hazard (Buckbeak) can be killed for injuring their children."

Who knows?  **Newt:** And if she stays there? If she meets someone else?  **Theseus:** … so that’s what this is about?  **Newt:** This you should understand.  **Theseus:** Alright … what if you met somebody else outside school?  **Newt:** Who, The?

Don’t need any O.W.L.s… I want to go into Zoology.  **Theseus:** You do want to spend your life with all kinds of creatures, don’t you? That’s what you’ve always wanted.  **Newt:** It’s what makes me happy.  **Theseus:** *sighs*Without any O.W.L.s …  **Newt:** I’ll have to convince them without. And once Leta is done with school, she’ll join me… and then we’ll spend our life’s studying magical creatures, maybe travelling around the world together…  **Theseus:** What about her family then?  **Newt:** Once we make enough money, they’ll be content. And if not… she doesn’t need them. And they don’t mind losing a family member.  **Theseus:** Alright … if you say so…  **Newt:** She promised me.  **Theseus:** *silence* *nods*  **Newt:** I’ll be alright, The. I still got my wand… they’ll notice that.  **Theseus:** *nods* … You could still ask Dumbledore if…  **Newt:** He’s done more than enough for me. And … I want to do this.  **Theseus:** *silence*  **Newt:** Don’t try to convince me otherwise… or them. Please…  **Theseus:** *silence*  **Newt:** *puts hand on his back* You can’t protect me this time.  **Theseus:** *tears roll down face* Newt… dammit, you can't just...   **Newt:** *hugs him* *tears running as well* We’ll write each other.  **Theseus:** Sure… I can’t leave you all unattended, right?  **Newt:** *chuckles*  **Theseus:** What if you chose wrong?  **Newt:** Then I’ll go home. Look after of the Hippogriffs… didn’t you say your life was going somewhere else?  **Theseus:** True.  **Newt:** *smiles*  **Theseus:** But that’s not all I meant…  **Newt:** I trust Leta.  **Theseus:** *sighs*  **Newt:** She’s not going to let me down.  **Theseus:** *silence*  **Newt:** *sighs*  **Theseus:** *lets go* Let’s drop that… when are you leaving?  **Newt:** If they expel me, which is certain… by the end of the week. I’m not allowed to answer questions from the others… I’ll just attend classes until they give me a date to leave.  **Theseus:** … I’ll ask for a day off. They’ll let me go…  **Newt:** Are you sure?  **Theseus:** Well, I’ve got a more important NEWT to think about then, they’ll understand…  **Newt:** *laughs*  **Theseus:** Newt…  **Newt:** Yes?  **Theseus:** Nevermind. I’ll just miss you… like hell…  **Newt:** I’ll miss you too… like bloody hell. *wipes own tears away*  **Theseus:** *presses his hand*  **Newt:** *looks down* - *his stomach growls* Sorry… they kept me in their offices all day…  **Theseus:** Let’s go then, dinner should still be served…  *both get up and leave the room*  **Newt:** Wait. *pulls out wand from the door and swings it* *his belongings rise up and fly into his suitcase*  **Theseus:** *sighs*  **Newt:** Let’s go.  **Theseus:** *nods*   ______________________________________________________"

1054,a couple realizations i had while re reading order of the phoenix so been re reading ootp and started thinking more behind the scenes of what we learn in the books from harry's perspective a couple details in particular stood out to me and as far as i can tell i have not seen it mentioned anywhere else before ran it by a couple of my friends who are also huge hp fans who hadn't really made the connection before either so mostly just curious if anyone else has had this realization apologies in advance for the wall of text but without further ado i had always assumed that voldemort become aware on his own that he and harry were connected enough that harry could see into voldemort's mind but i think it was actually kreacher that made him aware when harry and the weasleys return to grimmauld place after harry's vision of mr weasley being attacked by nagini kreacher would have overheard that harry was able to see into voldemort's mind and mentioned this to the malfoy's after sirius told him to get out thus the plotting begins to use this to voldemort's advantage and i suspect snape might have been looped into the plot which he immediately told dumbledore about and that's when snape and dumbledore decide to teach harry occlumency because they know rather than suspect voldemort will be luring harry to the ministry to retrieve the prophecy naturally dumbledore and snape could not be too blatant in their attempts to prevent harry from being baited without accidentally blowing snape's cover as a double agent and they couldn't tell harry the exact reason for learning occlumency because voldemort might be able to learn through the shared connection with harry this all became especially apparent to me when dumbledore is about to flee from hogwarts presumably to hunt horcruxes after stunning fudge and friends he tells harry the most important thing he needs to focus on is learning occlumency and that harry will learn why soon enough i don't have exact quote in front of me i interpret this to mean dumbledore is fully aware of voldemort's plot to lure harry and is not just guessing that voldemort might do so at this point it's only a matter of time before the scheme is put into motion lastly it seemed almost too convenient that voldemort and company accurately guessed that harry might appear in the fire to confirm whether sirius was at grimmauld place i realized it was because harry had already done so when appearing a few weeks earlier to talk to sirius and lupin about snape's memory of james tormenting him when harry showed up the first time lupin mentioned sirius was trying to get kreacher out of the attic which at the time i thought was more to do with them not being able to find kreacher because he was out plotting with the malfoy's but if we assume kreacher actually was in the attic then he would have overheard lupin telling sirius that harry was in the fire and wanted to talk in which case kreacher would have gone and told the malfoy's so basically this was the final piece of the puzzle for the scheme to lure harry to the ministry show harry that sirius was captured and taken to where the prophecy is and if harry tries to check on him he will likely use floo powder so keep sirius as far away from the fireplace in grimmauld place as possible after the fight in the ministry dumbledore does tell harry that he only recently learned kreacher had been communicating with the malfoy's but if my suspicions are correct that he knew the plot all along he was still having to preserve snape's cover and couldn't tell harry how much he knew not to mention it would have made dumbledore sound like a total dick to be like oh yeah sorry i knew this was going to happen but didn't do more to stop it i'd love to hear everyone else's take on this and by all means feel free to point out whether i'm late to the game on this realization i mostly just want to share my excitement over still discovering things in these

mani re read tl dr dumbledor might have known of the full scheme to lure harri to the ministri shortli after harry' vision of mr weasley get attack by nagini but had to preserv snape' cover as a doubl agent,"A couple realizations I had while re-reading Order of the Phoenix So been re-reading OotP and started thinking more ""behind the scenes"" of what we learn in the books from Harry's perspective. A couple details in particular stood out to me, and as far as I can tell, I have not seen it mentioned anywhere else before. Ran it by a couple of my friends who are also huge HP fans who hadn't really made the connection before either, so mostly just curious if anyone else has had this realization. Apologies in advance for the wall of text, but without further ado...  & #   I had always assumed that Voldemort become aware on his own that he and Harry were connected enough that Harry could see into Voldemort's mind, but I think it was actually Kreacher that made him aware. When Harry and the Weasleys return to Grimmauld Place after Harry's ""vision"" of Mr. Weasley being attacked by Nagini, Kreacher would have overheard that Harry was able to see into Voldemort's mind and mentioned this to the Malfoy's after Sirius told him to ""get out"". Thus, the plotting begins to use this to Voldemort's advantage, and I suspect Snape might have been looped into the plot which he immediately told Dumbledore about and that's when Snape and Dumbledore decide to teach Harry occlumency, because they \*know, rather than suspect, Voldemort will be luring Harry to the Ministry to retrieve the prophecy. Naturally, Dumbledore and Snape could not be too blatant in their attempts to prevent Harry from being baited without accidentally blowing Snape's cover as a double agent, and they couldn't tell Harry the exact reason for learning occlumency because Voldemort might be able to learn through the shared connection with Harry.   & #   This all became especially apparent to me when Dumbledore is about to flee from Hogwarts (presumably to hunt horcruxes?) after stunning Fudge and friends, he tells Harry the most important thing he needs to focus on is learning occlumency and that Harry will \*learn \*why \*soon \*enough (I don't have exact quote in front of me). I interpret this to mean Dumbledore is fully aware of Voldemort's plot to lure Harry and is not just guessing that Voldemort might do so. At this point, it's only a matter of time before the scheme is put into motion.  & #   Lastly, it seemed almost too convenient that Voldemort and company accurately guessed that Harry might appear in the fire to confirm whether Sirius was at Grimmauld place. I realized it was because Harry had already done so when appearing a few weeks earlier to talk to Sirius and Lupin about Snape's memory of James tormenting him.

So basically, this was the final piece of the puzzle for the scheme to lure Harry to the ministry: show Harry that Sirius was captured and taken to where the prophecy is, and if Harry tries to check on him, he will likely use floo powder, so keep Sirius as far away from the fireplace in Grimmauld Place as possible.   & #   After the fight in the ministry, Dumbledore does tell Harry that he only recently learned Kreacher had been communicating with the Malfoy's, but if my suspicions are correct that he knew the plot all along, he was still having to preserve Snape's cover and couldn't tell Harry how much he knew, not to mention it would have made Dumbledore sound like a total dick to be like ""oh yeah, sorry, I knew this was going to happen but didn't do more to stop it.  & #   I'd love to hear everyone else's take on this, and by all means feel free to point out whether I'm late to the game on this realization.

That just means it's going to continue to drop. WB will have to do something new and exciting next to make sure it makes more money next time.  They could conclude the Fantastic Beasts Series in movie 3. Then movie 4 and 5 can be completely different wizarding word stories. Or a spinoff with a sequel to Fantastic Beasts. Endless possibilities.  One day, Harry Potter will be like Marvel. There will be so many solo movies of wizarding world stories that will build and connect.  There is only one more movie in the series and then JK continues and concludes it in novel form.  It movies to WB streaming service.  It is cancelled completely.  Or it just continues to be 3 more films in Fantastic Beasts and the audience isn't paid attention to and it pisses people off so much that HP becomes hated like Star Wars. Only to come back with a reboot in 10 years.   It becomes a TV series and concludes in an epic theatre release.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Ruper Grint come back for movies about the next generation, like Star Wars Force Awakens. They are much older now. Harry Potter fans who were in their early teens would now be in their 40's and up. We all now have our Harry Potter movies back but they are nothing like the original 7. So different and weird and great. Our kids now experience a new Harry Potter and prefer it. Not even written by JK Rowling. Ultimate fan fiction of people who were fans as kids, now making new movies using their years of fan fiction and theorizing.   & #"

total okay with thing go on around feel the need in a fantasi world,"Is Harry Potter Adults’ Choice?    Harry Potter is a series of children’s books written by a British author J. K. Rowling. The series later had a movie franchise that was as successful as the book series. The series has huge popularity, critical acclaim as well as commercial success all over the world. The series is often considered to be the cornerstones of modern young adult literature. The series has also had its share of criticism, such as concern about the increasingly dark tone with the series’ progression, as well as the scary violence scenes it portrays. It has been more than 20 years since the first book of the series has been published, but it still has not lost its topicality. Furthermore, it continues to be so popular that the author continues to extend Harry Potter world with movies like “Fantastic Beasts and where to find them”. Along with the younger Potterheads, Harry Potter series have attracted a wide adult audience as well. The following analysis aims at discussing the reasons that make the book interesting not only for kids, but for adults as well.  The reason why so many kids like the books as well as the movies is that magic and wizardry are fascinating for kids. The series is so carefully and in detailed written that many kids believe in the world that Rowling has created and dream of becoming a part of that world. But not only do kids believe in the magical world that Rowling has created, but teens and adults do as well. This factor has had some backlash from conservative religious groups: these people believed that there is evil in the mystical storylines, accusing the author in promoting witchcraft. They even burnt the books as a sign of protest.  The fact that the series is enjoyed by adults can be confirmed by the research carried out by Scholastic. According to the research made in 2000 35% of Harry Potter readers are adults, and in a couple of years the number reached 50%. That is why the books are sold in two versions: with a cover for kids and a darker cover for adults. Some universities even offer Harry Potter-based courses, where the series is academically discussed and analyzed.  [Harry Potter and Adults’ Choice](https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fenlightngo.org%2Flanguage%2Fen%2Fpost%2F7804%3AL_HOz-gfHH0fvyT2hZUcrZje2UY& cuid=3932474)  The first reason that many adults like the series is that many people simply grew up with the series. The series is nostalgic for many adults, bringing back memories of when they were kids. For many people childhood is considered the happiest time of their lives and the series bring back those memories. Hence, the series and the heroes have become a link between childhood and adulthood for many people.  But the fact is that not all Harry Potter fans or Potterheads started to be interested in the series as kids. In this respect, some adults might like the series because no matter what everyone needs some magic in their lives and the series is a perfect way to bring some magic into their everyday lives. The search for magic in hope to escape from reality has created “kidults”.  **Kidults**  Adults trying to run away from the dullness of reality has emerged the new phenomenon known as kiduts (kid+adult). Kidults are adults whose interests are usually typical to those of kids. Kidults are basically what people would call “young at heart”, adults who strive for escapism. For some it is a chance to recapture the careless raptures of childhood, for others it is a chance to escape the hassle and hardships of adult life, while for others, it is both.  A fantasy world here serves as not only an escape from reality but as a source of inner peace becoming kind of a therapy helping to overcome personal and inner psychological problems and at the same time inspiring to take an action. Hence, adults trying to run away from the dullness of reality is one more reason why so many of them are fans of Harry Potter.  **My question is...**  Do you think that fantasy is a chance to escape the ""adult reality"" and it can be considered as a psychotherapy for those who has stressful life? Can one, who is totally okay with things going on around, feel the need in a fantasy world?"

Alright I know these are dime a dozen and everyone has their own far fetched theory on how JK will make the timeline work but here goes.   So it’s obvious GG’s obsession with an obscurials probably came from his encounters with Ariana. So what if Ariana didn’t die?  If she managed to escape the fight similarly to how Credence escaped at the end of FBAWTFT #1, she would have been 23 when the boat sank in Leta’s memory, killing the real Corvus. She easily could have spent that time learning how to control and manage her Obscurial like Credence did. She also would have been plenty old to have an infant, Aurelius.  Or he’s actually Corvus and GG is lying again. Either or."

safely assume ariana dumbledore was an obscurial gellert grindelwald was very much into dark twisted experiments he was expelled from durmstrang a school famous for its tolerance of dark arts albus dumbledore was a brilliant wizard he wanted to escape from his responsibilities and seek glory he felt trapped and wasted with grindelwald he saw a chance of being part of a revolution they both sought the deathly hallows of course their reasons were different albus turned a blind eye towards what he suspected grindelwald was for the greater good and now the guessing part based on the theories i read here grindelwald convinces albus to take out the obscurus out of ariana aberforth interrupts them and then there is a duel i am guessing grindelwald leaves with the obscurus but it is useless for him without a host obscurus are rare so he wouldn't give up that easily he thinks a sibling can act as one people are generally rejecting aurelius being a sibling based on percival being in azkaban and dying there they think grindelwald was lying to credence but i believe aurelius can be son of percival why because a dark powerful wizard wants it to be so breaking out of azkaban is not impossible sirius maybe the first who did it without outside help it wouldn't be difficult for someone like grindelwald to come up with a plan to free percival bartemius crouch did a similar thing yes percival was a man of honour but after all these years in azkaban we don't know how resistant he would be to an imperius curse or love potion or whatever so a son is born and he is given a proper name aurelius i am guessing grindelwald tried to make the boy a host for the obscurus but by now percival has started to fight against whatever spell he is under he finds out grindelwald is after aurelius and arranges to ship him to america with honoria dumbledore grindelwald follows them maybe there is a duel and percival dies we know what happens next ship carrying aurelius sinks grindelwald believes that he died so years later grindelwald foresees another obscurial in new york believing no obscurial could live that longer he doesn't think him to be aurelius but after he finds out he decides to use him against albus dumbledore whatever be the backstory i think this franchise is gonna be great for the fans there is so much to look forward to like the reaction of albus when he comes to know about aurelius maybe seeing the pain he is in he decides to do something he couldn't do before to save ariana maybe there is a reason why albus dumbledore considers love as the most powerful force phoenix are extremely loyal and would depart to find their own paths if their owners die rather than finding a new master however i choose to believe that in this case albus at least tries to do something so great for aurelius that his phoenix which i love to think is fawkes makes albus his new master what albus sees in mirror of erised is his family that is his deepest desire reason why his patronus is phoenix symbol of dumbledore family,theori about aureliu dumbledor i saw the movi yesterday and read mani theori here in reddit take idea from them i have tri to put one that seem most

Aurelius Dumbledore I saw the movie yesterday and read many theories here in reddit. Taking ideas from them I have tried to put one that seems most plausible. Thing we know or can safely assume:  \* Ariana Dumbledore was an obscurial.  \* Gellert Grindelwald was very much into dark twisted experiments. He was expelled from Durmstrang, a school famous for its tolerance of Dark Arts.  \* Albus Dumbledore was a brilliant wizard. He wanted to escape from his responsibilities and seek glory. He felt trapped and wasted. With Grindelwald he saw a chance of being part of a revolution. They both sought the Deathly Hallows. Of course their reasons were different. Albus turned a blind eye towards what he suspected Grindelwald was ""for the greater good"".  & #   And now the guessing part based on the theories I read here.  & #   Grindelwald convinces Albus to take out the obscurus out of Ariana. Aberforth interrupts them and then there is a duel. I am guessing Grindelwald leaves with the obscurus. But it is useless for him without a host. Obscurus are rare so he wouldn't give up that easily. He thinks a sibling can act as one. People are generally rejecting Aurelius being a sibling based on Percival being in Azkaban and dying there. They think Grindelwald was lying to Credence. But I believe Aurelius can be son of Percival. Why? Because a dark powerful wizard wants it to be so. Breaking out of Azkaban is not impossible. Sirius maybe the first who did it without outside help. It wouldn't be difficult for someone like Grindelwald to come up with a plan to free Percival. Bartemius Crouch did a similar thing. Yes, Percival was a man of honour but after all these years in Azkaban we don't know how resistant he would be to an Imperius curse or love potion or whatever.   	So a son is born and he is given a proper name Aurelius. I am guessing Grindelwald tried to make the boy a host for the obscurus. But by now Percival has started to fight against whatever spell he is under. He finds out Grindelwald is after Aurelius and arranges to ship him to America with Honoria Dumbledore. Grindelwald follows them, maybe there is a duel and Percival dies. We know what happens next ship carrying Aurelius sinks. Grindelwald believes that he died.  	So years later Grindelwald foresees another obscurial in New York. Believing no obscurial could live that longer he doesn't think him to be Aurelius. But after he finds out he decides to use him against Albus Dumbledore.   	Whatever be the backstory I think this franchise is gonna be great for the fans. There is so much to look forward to. Like the reaction of Albus when he comes to know about Aurelius. Maybe seeing the pain he is in he decides to do something he couldn't do before to save Ariana. Maybe there is a reason why Albus Dumbledore considers love as the most powerful force. Phoenix are extremely loyal and would depart to find their own paths if their owners die, rather than finding a new master. However I choose to believe that in this case Albus at least tries to do something so great for Aurelius that his phoenix which I love to think is Fawkes makes Albus his new master. What Albus sees in mirror of erised is his family. That is his deepest desire. Reason why his patronus is phoenix, symbol of Dumbledore family."

So we called them 'gods' and 'demons,' and begged them to spare us and prayed for salvation.  In time, their numbers dwindled and our numbers rose. The world began to make more sense when there were less things to fear. Yet, the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.  Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, we must stand up for ourselves.  While the rest of mankind dwell in the light, we must stand in the darkness to combat it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane, normal world.  We secure. We contain. We protect."

Granted, J.K. Rowling does make some attempt to explain this. She explained that Minister Shaklebolt had decreed that fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts and not switching to the death eater's side was more than enough proof of the sort of character and grit needed to be an auror.  Well, that certainly makes sense. But there's a slight problem: Character and grit are not the only conditions for being an auror. The five NEWTs required to even be considered for character analysis (recommended Potions, DADA, Transfiguration, Charms, and Herbology) exist for a reason. The ability to be under pressure without cracking is certainly necessary to be an auror, but it doesn't make one lick of difference if the guy fighting the dark wizards is a complete greenhorn who doesn't know the difference between ""crucio"" (torture curse) and ""crucial"" (aka ""essential""). That's why the academic requirements have to be met before the ministry would even *consider* all the character requirements.  Admittedly, the Ministry was streched super thin by the Second Wizarding War and therefore had to take anyone they could get. But there was no reason why they couldn't have asked Battle of Hogwarts survivors to continue their education while working as aurors part time. Plenty of college students IRL do that.  Even if Harry &  Ron were allowed to become aurors, I'd imagine they must have sucked balls at the job, since they didn't have the academic credentials that are normally required of aurors (and just to repeat: Those academic requirements exist for a reason).  What do you guys think?"

During Grindelwald’s prediction for WWII, Jacob uttered “nuclear war...” I find this problematic.   First, the mushroom cloud synonymous with an atomic bomb was first seen in Halifax in 1917 but the word “nuclear” wasn’t common prior to 1944.   Second, prior to 1944, the use of nuclear fission was termed the Atomic Age or Atomic Era. The bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were called atomic bombs. This wouldn’t occur until 1945.   Third, nuclear fission was known prior to 1944 but the application of nuclear fission to the development of an atomic bomb wasn’t until 1930 when the work of Albert Einstein was applied and even then it wasn’t until 1938 that an atom was split by German scientists. It took seven years and loads of resources to develop the first atomic bomb in 1945.   This bothers me because Jacob shouldn’t have known what the mushroom cloud signified or even had words to explain what the bomb was.   I can brush past the numerous other plot holes but this was poor history. Oddly I find that more of an affront than the identity of Credence or Queenie’s decision.   Had they showed the mushroom cloud and the resulting devastation for emotional impact that would’ve been appropriate. They were devastating and ended WWII for that very reason. But to apply the wrong term and make it seem like it was common knowledge was poor story telling.   Loved the movie but this one flaw just disappointed me.   I won’t get into the whole “American Ministry of Magic” label... It’s the US. It would’ve been labeled “Department” but that’s neither here nor there."

I have been a fan of the series since they came out but a couple years ago I listened to the audiobooks through, just for fun. I started listening before sleep, and since I knew the story, the next night I would just  start listening to the part I last remembered before falling asleep.  I have an anxiety disorder, and I often found it hard to fall asleep because I would get frequent racing/spiraling thoughts (about my day, pervasive self criticism, or anything in general). Some nights it got so crippling that I would stay awake for hours, trying to distract myself by playing phone games/scrolling through reddit.  After I started listening before bed, I noticed that it was very easy for me to fall asleep. The story, as read by Mr Jim Dale, is so engaging that I was able to focus on Harry's story instead of counterproductively ruminating on my own.  I now own all the books on Audible and I have listened through hundreds of times. :)"
2043,what are personality traits of harry potter characters that are often glossed over or forgotten about by the fan base i thought this would be an interesting question we discuss the hp characters a lot but one of the great things about jkr's writing is that characters mostly feel like real people with positives and negatives and many layers to their personalities however in saying that it happens quite often that smaller personality traits are often forgotten or not discussed for instance we know hermione loves books that is a key characteristic of hers that we all know but are there any traits hermione has shown over the course of the books that are not widely discussed or known an example i have is with luna everyone thinks of her as a bit airy and someone that is very open minded and things like that and she is for the most part but luna has a trait in her personality where she does not like people questioning her beliefs this is one example gt anything good in there asked ron as harry closed the magazine gt of course not said hermione scathingly before harry could answer gt the quibbler s rubbish everyone knows that gt excuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality my father s the editor gt i oh said hermione looking embarrassed well it s got some interesting i mean it s quite gt i ll have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forward she snatched it out of harry s hands rifling through it to page fiftyseven she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it i mean this is not the greatest example but it shows luna is capable of anger and i do recall other instances where she gets angry or annoyed when someone suggests her beliefs might not be real it isn't something that happens much probably only a few times in the entire of the last  books but it is a characteristic of hers one not often discussed here is an example of hermione's more light hearted side we almost never see and is not widely discussed gt the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until they d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig gt malfoy s got detention i could sing gt don t harry advised her i mean can you imagine hermione doing a little jig i mean she did one and it is almost hard to imagine but it shows that being silly is part of hermione a part she tries to hide another example gt wha yeah of course he said pulling himself together gt well okay if i can t get slughorn to talk this afternoon i ll take some felix and have another go this evening gt that s decided then said hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette destination determination deliberation she murmured gt oh stop that ron begged her i feel sick enough as it is quick hide me gt it isn t lavender said hermione impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and ron dived behind her missed it gt that s decided then said hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette can anyone imagine hermione doing a graceful pirouette i mean it just doesn't seem like a hermione thing to do but it is another example of her being silly or just having fun that i think we as fans often forget so what are some little

I thought this would be an interesting question. We discuss the HP characters a lot but one of the great things about JKR's writing is that characters mostly feel like real people, with positives and negatives and many layers to their personalities.  However, in saying that it happens quite often that smaller personality traits are often forgotten or not discussed. For instance, we know Hermione loves books, that is a key characteristic of hers that we all know, but are there any traits Hermione has shown over the course of the books that are not widely discussed or known?  An example I have is with Luna. Everyone thinks of her as a bit airy, and someone that is very open minded and things like that, and she is for the most part, but Luna has a trait in her personality where she does not like people questioning her beliefs. This is one example  &gt;“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.  &gt;“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer,  &gt;“The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.”  &gt;“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality. “My father’s the editor.”  &gt;“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .”  &gt;“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fiftyseven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it  I mean this is not the greatest example, but it shows Luna is capable of anger, and I do recall other instances where she gets angry or annoyed when someone suggests her beliefs might not be real. It isn't something that happens much, probably only a few times in the entire of the last 3 books, but it is a characteristic of hers, one not often discussed.  Here is an example of Hermione's more light hearted side we almost never see and is not widely discussed  &gt;The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.  &gt;“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”  &gt;“Don’t,” Harry advised her.  I mean can you imagine Hermione doing a little jig? I mean she did one, and it is almost hard to imagine, but it shows that being silly is part of Hermione, a part she tries to hide.  Another example  &gt;“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself together.  &gt;“Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.”  &gt;“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. “Destination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .” she murmured.  &gt;“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!”  &gt;“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.  Missed it?  &gt;“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette  Can anyone imagine Hermione doing a graceful pirouette?

81,are some horcuxes more powerful than others when somebody makes a horcrux they split off half of their soul and slap it into something and voldemort has multiple of them so the more he creates the less soul the next one will have so does he get weaker and weaker the more of his soul he splits off it would only make sense because otherwise the fact that his soul was split apart so much wouldn't have much bearing other than it makes him slightly more evil each time,are some horcux more power than other when somebodi make a horcrux they split off half of their soul and slap it into someth and voldemort ha multipl of them so the more he creat the less soul the next one will have so doe he get weaker and weaker the more of hi soul he split off it would onli make sens becaus otherwis the fact that hi soul wa split apart so much wouldn't have much bear other than it make him slightli more evil each time,are some horcux more power than other when somebodi make a horcrux they split off half of their soul and slap it into someth and voldemort ha multipl of them so the more he creat the less soul the next one will have so doe he get weaker and weaker the more of hi soul he split off it would onli make sens becaus otherwis the fact that hi soul wa split apart so much wouldn't have much bear other than it make him slightli more evil each time,"Are some Horcuxes more powerful than others?

It would only make sense because otherwise the fact that his soul was split apart so much wouldn't have much bearing other than it makes him slightly more evil each time."

Harry then makes a comment that she shouldn't talk about his parents like that. But Petunia never responds. Then in the Prince's Tale we see Snape telling Lily about Azkaban with Petunia eavesdropping.   So, contrary to what we were led to believe, was the awful boy Snape? Or do we just assume that she later heard James telling Lily again when they were older?  It never quite clicked in my head before that Petunia must remember Snape! I wonder what her reaction would have been if she had a little more interest in Harry and realised Snape was one of his teachers."

Now that's out of the way. Honestly, I just find them stupid... that's it, but this is why I find them stupid. There are only 4 houses, why are you mix matching them? Although I do understand why someone may align themselves with a hybrid house because you don't fit into one of the 4 houses perfectly, well guess what... no one does. We're human after all and nobody will most likely only fit into one house only. So how about instead of aligning yourself with a hybrid house truly look at yourself and you'll find what house you belong in. You may call yourself a Gryfinpuff or whatever but what do you value above all else, there is where you'll find the answer. So how about commit to a Hogwarts house or just do the Pottermore quiz and there you go. Because if you were really at Hogwarts the sorting hat isn't going to yell Slytherpuff and no one is going to make a common room just for you. So take a dive into self discovery and find your Hogwarts House. But then again, this is only fictional after all."

I, by no means, am saying that the movie is pitch perfect because the second act meanders a lot and has a lot of convoluted, contrived stories only existing to get our heroes to the finale in the cemetery and there are a couple of retcons I don't quite like but the opening scene and the final scene are pitch perfect. The critics call this movie ""a franchise killing disaster"", I'm like, overexaggerating much?! Some of the reviews I've read do their best to avoid any mention of Johnny Depp's amazing turn as Grindelwald, completely ignoring it.  While I agree that JK needs some help in making the story flow better because she's not a screenwriter but an author, the convoluted nature of the second act didn't bother me much, especially given how intense the opening and the climactic sequences were ending the story on a high.  What did you guys think?!"

So we find out that Filtch is a Squib and we meet others throughout the series but they all seem to be social pariahs. But why don’t they simply go into the nonincantation aspects of magic like potions making?  As far as we have seen the on thing needed for potions making is knowledge and materials. Obviously cleanup is a lot easier with magic but it seems like it could be done. Or they could do care of magical creatures. What else do y’all think they could do other than only being a squib?

The vast majority of the series is set in a school. And of course, the fact that this school is a literal castle that teaches magic to students makes it pretty remarkable for everyone reading it. But I’m particularly grateful for the fact that until recently I’ve been ignorant of British norms in schools.   Sorting students into houses was a pretty magical concept to me, especially reading the books as a young child. I’d never heard of anything like a head boy or head girl. Even the term “headmaster” had such a regal connotation to it as opposed to the American high school Principal.   I just don’t think I’d get quite the same “other-worldly” feeling if Hogwarts were written with the same organization system as my high school. And of course I don’t think where you’re from/what school you attend detracts from the series in the slightest, especially with how well-crafted the castle is. However, I am grateful that I got just a little extra sense of wonder as I was able to discover the all of the intricacies of Hogwarts."

For example, at the end of PoA after they realize Sirius has escaped, he comes into the infirmary and yells about how Harry had something to do with this (which of course he's right).  This made me think about the portrayal of him in the movies where he was almost emotionless the entire time.

My top 5 Including reasons why!   1. Fred and George Weasley.   There wasnt any characters like them in the entire series, and they didnt get given as much to do as others and that was a shame.   2. Bellatrix Lestrange.  She was the best written villain of Harry Potter, and Helena Bonham Carter did the damn thing and I loved it.   3. Draco Malfoy.  As the series progressed, especially HBP, Draco as a character developed so much, but it went nowhere after that. He was shown to be a product of his father's discipline, and deep down he wasnt a horrible person, and redemption was always there and I will forever hate whoever made the decision to cut the scene with him in DH2.   4. Alastor Moody.  Considering a lot of his character was *played* by Barty Jr, it would have been interesting to see the real Moody more than what we got.    5. Horace Slughorn.  I only wanted a little bit more from Slughorn as he wasnt really a favourite character of mine. I wish him and Voldemort had one final scene together after what was shown in his memories. Along with Slughorns death.   Honourable mentions;  Dobby, Rita Skeeter, Mcgonagall and Voldemorts younger self."

In Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone, Vernon Dursley agrees to take Harry to King's Cross, but only because he thinks that Harry will be stranded there because there's no such thing as Platform Nine and Three Quarters. As Rowling writes ...   &gt;Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. &gt;  &gt; ""Have a good term,"" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing.  Well, after the events of the first book, that hope is shot. They know full well that there is indeed such a thing as Platform Nine and Three Quarters; it's just hidden from muggles via magic. So they can't play that cruel joke on Harry anymore.  It is rather convenient that all books after that have Harry leaving the Dursleys before the end of the summer Holidays. Chamber of Secrets had Ron, Fred, &  George rescuing Harry from his bedroom prison. Prisoner of Azkaban had Harry heading to Diagon Alley for the last two weeks. Goblet of Fire had Harry going to Weasleys House for the Quidditch World Cup. Order of the Phoenix had Harry removed due to his pending criminal charges, and Half-Blood Prince had Harry heading to the Burrow after only two weeks.  I wonder ... if Harry had actually stayed with the Dursleys until the end of the summer holidays any other year, would the Dursleys have given Harry a lift to King's Cross? If not, how would Harry have gotten to King's Cross?"

See Snape. There are many legitimate arguments showcasing just how ruthless Albus really was.  I want to focus on one. Snape.  The popular question is why is such a terrible person is even allowed to teach the students. He clearly doesn’t like kids, and clearly doesn’t treat them right.   Why would Dumbledore allow this? He had no choice.  In the moment Snape begged Dumbledore to save Lily’s life - Dumbledore, ever the opportunist, asked what Snape would do for him.  😂  So cold. Honestly. That’s cold, methodical, ruthless af. And when Snape said anything, Dumbledore knew Snape was his ace. He needed Snape at Hogwarts, not bc he wanted him there, but bc he needed to make sure Snape wouldn’t bolt on the agreement.  Someone as miserable as Snape probably tried to get away. But Dumbledore couldn’t let him. And so Snape lashed out at the most innocent - the students.  Dumbledore trapped him there.  I dare say neither of them actually liked each other. It’s been awhile since I read canon, so I’m theorizing off I remember. Thoughts?"

McGonagall's presence in CoG doesn't seem like it's part of some bigger plan involving espionage and time-turners. It seems like Jo thought the audience might think it's neat to hear that name and see a young McGonagall and then she didn't go check her previous writing on the matter so now it's muddying up the timelines.  Credence's age is a bit thrown with this movie because it says he was adopted in 1904, but that the shipwreck happened in 1901, meaning Credence was born somewhere around 1901, but that would make him 25 years old in the first Fantastic Beasts movie and that seems unlikely that at 25 he would still be hanging around Mary Lou Barebone and letting her treat him like that. It also means that he is pretty close to Newt's age and yet Jo continually writes in the scripts other characters referring to him as ""kid"".  I don't believe that there is a contemplated reason for everything that Jo writes. I think she just doesn't always remember the things she writes or says previously and then while writing new material isn't very diligent about going back to check."

the daughter, return great avenger with wings from the water”*  \- from the Predictions of Tycho Dodonus  My favorite character in the first Fantastic Beasts film was Queenie, who has a heartbreaking but understandable turnaround in this new film – what can I say? I like the conflicted characters best.   Which brings me to Yusuf Kama, also very conflicted. He was obsessed with Tycho’s predictions, and assumed they referred to his family and to himself. But do they? I’m also more interested in his Unbreakable Vow. If he was sworn to avenge his family on the “person who Corvus Lestrange loved best in the world” (Or something like that; if the wording on that’s off, please tell me what you remember!), has he achieved that? And if so, what happens to you and your Unbreakable Vow? If you can’t achieve it, you die. But it’s obvious that Yusuf isn’t dead, at least, not yet. Does an Unbreakable Vow have more to do with what you *believe* you have or haven’t done, or does it have to do with what you’ve *actually* done?  Yusuf assumes that the person Corvus Lestrange loved most was Leta’s little brother, also named Corvus Lestrange, who she abandoned to be accidentally killed. But if Yusuf is still alive, that means one of two things: either little Corvus is still alive, or little Corvus isn’t the one Corvus Lestrange Sr. loved best. It obviously wasn’t Lita that her father loved best, by her own and Yusuf’s admission, and when she died, Yusuf was still fine and dandy, too. So how does he resolve this Unbreakable Vow? What do you think?  There’s also the idea of whether Corvus and Lita may or may not be the ones referred to in Tycho’s predictions. Who do you think they refer to?"

I think everything we learned in this movie is a downright lie I think Lita was either lying or didn't know the whole story or something strange happened there cuz that baby swap is weird . The Credence reveal I really don't believe that's true at all just based on Cannon and timelines. If you look at all the promo footage and all the trailers there is a lot of stuff that happened in those trailers that felt like misdirection for example the deluminator was used in trailers not seen in the film, the scene with Lita spinning and her fancy dress not in the movie, Credence releasing his obscurus on top of the building in Paris not in there. I'm also taking into consideration what JK Rowling said a few weeks ago about ""what you think you know might be wrong"" unless they are seriously messing with book Canon (I'm looking you McGonagall) I don't know it's just a theory but it's the one I'm living in."

2660,the least useful deathly hallow is the resurrection stone specifically if we are talking about how the hallows make one master of death i had never thought about this much and i dont know why other than harry using it in the forbidden forest which seems like an extremely specific way to benefit from the stone everyone else who uses it doesnt seem to benefit in any way for instance dumbledore and the brother in the story of the deathly hallows the philosophers stone seems much more useful in comparison especially if you want to personally become master of death it allows you to make the elixir of life and therefore live a long time and it allows you to turn things into gold in comparison the resurrection stone can only bring people back to this world as a sort of ghost im not sure how anyone could really benefit from this apart from the specific situation of harry needing support that doesnt seem to make anyone the master of death really overall i just think the resurrection stone seems like the least useful deathly hallow by far compared to the elder wand and cloak it seems like its existence was in the books simply to provide harry with a way to talk to his parents before he died to voldemort the philosphers stone seems much more useful what other situations is the resurrection stone beneficial in any way thoughts,the least use deathli hallow is the resurrect stone specif if we are talk about how the hallow make one master of death i had never thought about thi much and i dont know whi other than harri use it in the forbidden forest which seem like an extrem specif way to benefit from the stone everyon els who use it doesnt seem to benefit in ani way for instanc dumbledor and the brother in the stori of the deathli hallow the philosoph stone seem much more use in comparison especi if you want to person becom master of death it allow you to make the elixir of life and therefor live a long time and it allow you to turn thing into gold in comparison the resurrect stone can onli bring peopl back to thi world as a sort of ghost im not sure how anyon could realli benefit from thi apart from the specif situat of harri need support that doesnt seem to make anyon the master of death realli overal i just think the resurrect stone seem like the least use deathli hallow by far compar to the elder wand and cloak it seem like it exist wa in the book simpli to provid harri with a way to talk to hi parent befor he die to voldemort the philosph stone seem much more use what other situat is the resurrect stone benefici in ani way thought,the least use deathli hallow is the resurrect stone specif if we are talk about how the hallow make one master of death i had never thought about thi much and i dont know whi other than harri use it in the forbidden forest which seem like an extrem specif way to benefit from the stone everyon els who use it doesnt seem to benefit in ani way for instanc dumbledor and the brother in the stori of the deathli hallow the philosoph stone seem much more use in comparison especi if you want to person becom master of death it allow you to make the elixir of life and therefor live a long time and it allow you to turn thing into gold in comparison the resurrect stone can onli bring peopl back to thi world as a sort of ghost im not sure how anyon could realli benefit from thi apart from the specif situat of harri need support that doesnt seem to make anyon the master of death realli overal i just think the resurrect stone seem like the least use deathli hallow by far compar to the elder wand and cloak it seem like it exist wa in the book simpli to provid harri with a way to talk to hi parent befor he die to voldemort the philosph stone seem much more use what other situat is the resurrect stone benefici in ani way thought,"The Least Useful Deathly Hallow is.... The resurrection stone. Specifically if we are talking about how the hallows make one ""master of death"".  I had never thought about this much and i dont know why. Other than Harry using it in the Forbidden Forest, which seems like an extremely specific way to benefit from the stone, everyone else who uses it doesnt seem to benefit in any way.  For instance Dumbledore and the brother in the story of the deathly hallows.  The philosophers stone seems much more useful in comparison, especially if you want to personally become ""master of death"". it allows you to make the elixir of life and therefore live a long time, and it allows you to turn things into gold.   In comparison the resurrection stone can only bring people back to this world as a sort of ""ghost"". Im not sure how anyone could really benefit from this apart from the specific situation of harry needing support. That doesnt seem to make anyone the ""master of death"" really.   Overall i just think the resurrection stone seems like the least useful deathly hallow by far. Compared to the elder wand and cloak, it seems like its existence was in the books simply to provide Harry with a way to talk to his parents before he ""died"" to Voldemort. The philosphers stone seems much more useful.   What other situations is the resurrection stone beneficial in any way?   thoughts?"

Why did he attempt to kill Molly? He didn't even have that intense of a reaction when Nagini died and it was definitely not because he was afraid to lose the war. Lord Voldemort would never rely on a single Death Eater who didn't even master her wand especially when he thought that he was the master of the Elder Wand. What was the point of this? It was not significant to the plot in any way. Why did JK Rowling have him do it? What did she think? I think it was just stupid and waste of lines. Did she try to humanise him or something? If that was the case, then it was an extremely stupid thing to even try. Bellatrix's death is the only part in the Battle of Hogwarts that I prefer in the movies because there is no scream. I cringed at the scream. Why did she have to do it? I just need to know why it was worth mentioning in the books. And Snape was clearly his favourite at that time, not Bellatrix. It makes no sense that he didn't even regret Snape's death but went all bonkers on the death of a woman who had lost him a piece of his soul less than a day ago. I am not saying that he would regret Snape's death. What I am saying is that Lord Voldemort would never react like that to the death of a mere servant. I cannot accept the scream as canon, no matter what."
1387,harry potter animated so a little while ago i tried to get my friend to read the hp books the only problem is that they have add and have never liked reading because they just don't have the attention span for it i thought that the next best thing was to show them the movies and afterword try to explain some of the story lines they left out that gave me an idea what if the books were adapted into animated movies they don't have to even come out in theaters this would allow freedom in run time so they could really fit everything from the books into them and with all the amazing and talented people who make fan art they could really experiment with art style preferably  when they are animated this allows character design to stay consistent unlike with them movies when they didn't know how the kids would turn out looking would love to hear feedback in the comments,harri potter anim so a littl while ago i tri to get my friend to read the hp book the onli problem is that they have add and have never like read becaus they just don't have the attent span for it i thought that the next best thing wa to show them the movi and afterword tri to explain some of the stori line they left out that gave me an idea what if the book were adapt into anim movi they don't have to even come out in theater thi would allow freedom in run time so they could realli fit everyth from the book into them and with all the amaz and talent peopl who make fan art they could realli experi with art style prefer  when they are anim thi allow charact design to stay consist unlik with them movi when they didn't know how the kid would turn out look would love to hear feedback in the comment,harri potter anim so a littl while ago i tri to get my friend to read the hp book the onli problem is that they have add and have never like read becaus they just don't have the attent span for it i thought that the next best thing wa to show them the movi and afterword tri to explain some of the stori line they left out that gave me an idea what if the book were adapt into anim movi they don't have to even come out in theater thi would allow freedom in run time so they could realli fit everyth from the book into them and with all the amaz and talent peopl who make fan art they could realli experi with art style prefer  when they are anim thi allow charact design to stay consist unlik with them movi when they didn't know how the kid would turn out look would love to hear feedback in the comment,"Harry Potter Animated so a little while ago I tried to get my friend to read the HP books, the only problem is that they have ADD and have never liked reading because they just don't have the attention span for it.  I thought that the next best thing was to show them the movies and afterword try to explain some of the story lines they left out. That gave me an idea, what if the books were adapted into animated movies, they don't have to even come out in theaters. this would allow freedom in run time so they could really fit everything from the books into them. and with all the amazing and talented people who make fan art they could really experiment with art style. (preferably 2D) when they are animated this allows character design to stay consistent, unlike with them movies when they didn't know how the kids would turn out looking. would love to hear feedback in the comments :)"

Most of which have probably already been voiced but the one thing I haven't seen too many other people talking about is the representation of Dumbledore and Grindelwald.   Dumbledore is supposed to be a mysterious, whimsical, and eccentric person. I don't think Jude Law's portrayal of him was *bad,* just not accurate. I felt Dumbledore came off as just this cool and well-liked Professor who was pretty good at magic. We needed to see the REAL Dumbledore, the one that we got to know in the original Harry Potter series. He was too ordinary in this new movie.   Second, I have always imagined Grindelwald to be more like the Joker in the sense that he's pure evil and also a little crazy. All the glimpses we saw of him in the original Harry Potter books seemed to prove this (him jumping off the windowsill, his last moments before Voldemort kills him, and so on). In the movie, he was like freaking Jack Frost. Cold, closed off, and not at all cool, he didn't appear evil only manipulative and somewhat bad. Grindelwald is supposed to be powerful and dangerous and just this pure evil person consumed by his own desire for a Pureblood world. I was so incredibly disappointed with this portrayal of him. And while we're on that note, I couldn't see Depp as Grindelwald...I just kept seeing as Johnny Depp with lots of makeup on.   All in all, the movie had lots of issues but this bothered me the most. Thoughts? What did you think of how they were portrayed in the movie and how did you envision Grindelwald to be?"

Yeah, I was pretty naive back in the day.  I was shocked when the book had to fall happen so quickly and quietly. No fighting, no battles, no rebellion at all.

I refer to how it goes: they met at Hogwarts, had a lot in common, were both seen as misfits &  outcasts, both were interested in creatures; they became close, Newt fell in love with Leta. Then there was an incident with a Jarvey that Leta was responsible for, and another student was hurt/endangered.  Newt decided to take the fall for what Leta actually did, and was expelled from Hogwarts as a result.  Because Leta ""was a taker"", this ended their relationship and broke Newt's heart.   We know now that much of this story did happen, but there's still much we don't know about what really went on between Newt and Leta.

But really? Cedric from the puffs. Luna from the ravens.  Ofc almost ever single gryff in the goddman series. Yet not a single slytherin (in Harry's generation) that could've actually helped them.  Ffs. Its so infuriating and its not even my slytherin bias, it could've been amazing to have a character out of there that would've made harry and by consequence Ronald to get the stick out of their assess and accept that while they do desk with scumbag snakes, their own prejudice of the green and silver house is just equally annoying.  I feel like a slytherin involved in their shenanigans would've been an amazing influence to add some cunning and structure in their bullshit Lion approach to everything barrelling in and hoping everything goes right. But nope all we get is draco, his two mini trolls henchmen, pansy the groupie and a glimpse of Theodore and Blaise.  I am an adult and i can understand not to share Harry's opinion but since the books ARE for children i doubt their won't eat up the assumption that ""Slytherin man bad"" thing."

The biggest issue I have is that Credence isn’t even old enough to be the child on the ship. The screenplay of CoG says that the shipwreck occurred in 1901. That would make Credence at least 26 in 1926 when the first movie takes place. Ezra Miller states in an interview that Credence is 18 in 1926, putting his birth year at 1908, 7 years after the shipwreck. Is it possible that Credence isn’t even related to the shipwreck at all? Why would he have Irma Dugard on his adoption papers if he isn’t even old enough to be the child on the shipwreck?

him do in the first one as graves this lie gets credence on his side and if he can give credence a name and reason for his power that he doesn't hate himself for he will value himself and that

the old feeling about ariana that we already saw when dumbledore was talking to leta albus is going to falter without a doubt spoiler  dumbledore is already known as a great wizard so this lie will

what you think,"Grindelwald is lying *spoiler* *this is all about The Crimes of Grindelwald, so spoilers below*   At the end of the movie, when Grindelwald gives his big reveal [about Credence's identity as a Dumbledore](#spoiler), I think Grindelwald is intentionally lying. This is such a huge thing to add to the canon for no real good reason, so I think Grindelwald made it up to manipulate [Credence](#spoiler) and Rowling wrote it to psyche us out.   Here's my reasoning:  1) Grindelwald was there when Ariana died and knows how that affected Albus.  2. I still think that Grindelwald is interested in obscuriouses, and the potential of Credence being the oldest and most powerful one ever.  This whole movie was about manipulating Credence and getting him to think that Grindelwald has information no one else does, which we also saw him do in the first one as Graves. This lie gets Credence on his side, and if he can give Credence a name and reason for his power that he doesn't hate himself for, he will value himself and that relationship. And now Grindelwald has a legit magical cannon at his disposal.  3) This is going to mess with Albus so hard. If [Grindelwald can throw an unknown brother into the battle that also brings up the old feeling about Ariana that we already saw when Dumbledore was talking to Leta, Albus is going to falter, without a doubt.](#spoiler)  4) Dumbledore is already known as a great wizard, so this lie will validate [Credence and give him something to hang onto tightly, this knowledge of his power and great lineage, when everyone else is fighting to take it away from him.

This will break [Credence's trust and revert him (and probably Queenie) back to Tina and Newts side](#spoiler) and setting the stage for the final battle of Dumbledore v Grindelwald.   Grindelwald lying here makes sense for the characters and the plot; it sets the stage for Dumbledore to open up about Ariana to Newt and strengthen the desire to defeat Grindelwald on a personal level and gets people talking about the movie for a little while. Hopefully this turns out to be true. Let me know what you think."

3979,the hunt for scamander theory previously i talked with a fellow tumblr user about why it seems that an entire squad of aurors is eager to get newt back to britain after his escape i think for the most part they came to hogwarts to ask for dumbledores help concerning grindelwald s escape remember he is known to be very intelligent and powerfull and until tom riddel asked for the post of the teacher for defense against the dark arts he had been offered the most of minister of magic three times not to mention that they refer to newt working under his orders how exactly did they know that but there are reason why they need to get newt back home so enjoy ___________________________________________  family bonds the one to put the most effort into this mission is likely his brother theseus the relationship between newt and his brother has always been described as tentiavely warm despite their differences through the letter theseus send him during the first movie and the scene by the end of the first tcog trailer we could see they are close as far as i can tell even though they may have some issues at the moment through theseus engagement i believe even before grindelwald s escape newt may have been targeted by his followers his brother is known as very powerfull a war hero joined the hunt for grindelwald and currently works in the department for magical law enforcement at the ministry he correspoded with percival graves during the incidents of new york and according to hp wiki he is head of the auror s deparment http //harrypotter wikia com/wiki/auror_department i think people have faith in that he is more than capable of fighting grindelwald and his followers maybe american wizards used to believe in percival graves the same way conclusion it would make sense for grindelwald to capture his brother and blackmail/mentally abuse him with this to maybe lure theseus to a trap or simply to kill newt and let him live with the fact that he couldn t save him that s a truly evil villian he selects those who the commoner believes in and shows him that they can be defeated so far we only know about one other biological family member of theseus which is his mother either she is magically very well protected or newt has become the main target through grindelwald s capture or his followers do try to abduct her and we will still get to see that all in all he would be safer in britain with the ministry his brother and dumbledore close enough especially in london or at least within the country ___________________________________________  a necessairy evil jk rowling has stated that throughout the next movie we will learn why newt was allowed to keep his wand and work at the ministry my conclusion is that even before he published his book he was known for his talent with magical creatures and his astounding knowledge a confident programme by the ministry in wwi involving ukrainian ironbellys has been mentioned in his biography on hp wiki http //harrypotter wikia com/wiki/newton_scamander we know that during the time of harry potter wizards are sucessfully working with dragons in romania but it seems that during this time there weren t many people who they d respond to so we know he is special in his own way that dumbledore has faith in him he accordingly sees him as a kindred spirit and that his skills are widely known especially after he publishes his book we also get a small hint on his history of not always obeying the law during his short talk with the minister of foreign affairs during the first movie and what are you doing in new york i came to buy an appaloosa puffskin sir right what are you really doing here notice how the minister goes from relaxed to a little strict to friendlily not buying the lie almost like newt has lied straight to his face many times before but he knows there can t be anything too sinister behind it conclusion the ministry knows newt can and will break the law when it comes to magical beasts but they avoid too active restrainment of his actions since  noone wants to actively cross neither dumbledore nor theseus and  they know he is a valuable mind and that his work throughout his life will improve the life of magical creatures worldwide and the knowledge about them not to mention that they may hope for his help during the war against grindelwald also some may fear though unfounded that if they actively turned on him/fractured his sanity he may offer his skills to the dark side remember this man knows how to train dragons _________________________________________________ alright that s all for now anything to add please let me know thank you very much for reading,the hunt for scamand theori previous i talk with a fellow tumblr user about whi it seem that an entir squad of

rememb thi man know how to train dragon _________________________________________________ alright that s all for now anyth to add pleas let me know thank you veri much for read,"The hunt for Scamander (?) (Theory) Previously, I talked with a fellow Tumblr user about why it seems that an entire squad of aurors is eager to get Newt back to Britain after his escape…  I think for the most part, they came to Hogwarts to ask for Dumbledores help concerning Grindelwald’s escape (remember, he is known to be very intelligent and powerfull, and until Tom Riddel asked for the post of the teacher for defense against the dark arts, he had been offered the most of minister of magic three times - not to mention that they refer to Newt working under “his orders” (how exactly did they know that?).  But there are reason why they need to get Newt back home … so enjoy :)  ___________________________________________   **1. Family bonds**  The one to put the most effort into this mission is likely his brother Theseus. The relationship between Newt and his brother has always been described as “tentiavely warm” despite their differences… through the letter Theseus send him during the first movie and the scene by the end of the first TCOG trailer, we could see they are close, as far as I can tell … even though they may have some issues at the moment through Theseus’ engagement.  I believe even before Grindelwald’s escape, Newt may have been targeted by his followers … his brother is known as “very powerfull”, a “war hero”, joined the hunt for Grindelwald and currently works in the department for magical law enforcement at the ministry. He correspoded with Percival Graves during the incidents of New York, and according to HP wiki, he is head of the auror’s deparment.  (http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror_Department )  I think people have faith in that he is more than capable of fighting Grindelwald and his followers… maybe american wizards used to believe in Percival Graves the same way …  Conclusion: it would make sense for Grindelwald to capture his brother and blackmail/mentally abuse him with this, to maybe lure Theseus to a trap - or simply to kill Newt and let him live with the fact that he couldn’t save him.  That’s a truly evil villian … he selects those who the commoner believes in and shows him that they can be defeated.  So far, we only know about one other biological family member of Theseus, which is his mother… either she is magically very well-protected or Newt has become the main target through Grindelwald’s capture… or his followers do try to abduct her and we will still get to see that :)  All in all, he would be safer in Britain with the ministry, his brother and Dumbledore close enough, especially in London… or at least within the country.  ___________________________________________   **2. A necessairy evil**  JK Rowling has stated that throughout the next movie we will learn why Newt was allowed to keep his wand and work at the ministry … my conclusion is that even before he published his book, he was known for his talent with magical creatures and his astounding knowledge… a confident programme by the ministry in WWI involving Ukrainian Ironbellys has been mentioned in his biography on HP wiki… http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Newton_Scamander  We know that during the time of Harry Potter, wizards are sucessfully working with dragons in Romania… but it seems that during this time, there weren’t many people who they’d respond to.  So, we know he is special in his own way, that Dumbledore has faith in him (he accordingly sees him as a kindred spirit), and that his skills are widely known, especially after he publishes his book … we also get a small hint on his history of not always obeying the law during his short talk with the minister (of foreign affairs) during the first movie.  *“… and what are you doing in New York?”  “I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskin, sir.”  “Right. What are you really doing here?”*  Notice how the minister goes from relaxed to a little strict to friendlily not buying the lie… almost like Newt has lied straight to his face many times before, but he knows there can’t be anything too sinister behind it.  Conclusion: the ministry knows Newt can and will break the law when it comes to magical beasts, but they avoid too active restrainment of his actions since 1. noone wants to actively cross neither Dumbledore nor Theseus and 2. they know he is a valuable mind and that his work throughout his life will improve the life of magical creatures worldwide and the knowledge about them.   Not to mention that they may hope for his help during the war against Grindelwald.  Also, some may fear (though unfounded) that if they actively turned on him/fractured his sanity, he may offer his skills to the dark side (remember, this man knows how to train dragons).   _________________________________________________   Alright, that’s all for now :) Anything to add?

and most are of dubious quality this one was gorgeous and one of the few that wasn't however i bought a snowy hogwarts theme instead since it was nearing christmas at the time or else i'd just been

remember which it was but the movie might've come out /after/ christmas in which case it was the latter in any event i thought i had saved the theme to my wanted list so i would be able to find it later but it seems to have disappeared i'm not sure if i removed it from my list by accident or if it was deleted because of a copyright strike although it wasn't branded a niffler theme it was called a platypus or hedgehog theme or something else and the other potter themes i've found in the themes store are still up and there are many unofficial harry potter game apps in the google play store

Given we’re talking about a repressed boy with a religious upbringing that goes to dark, secluded alleyways to meet with a handsome man who gently caresses him, it’s clear Graves is acting like a sexual predator. This behavior somewhat continues in the next movie, notably during the Fiendfyre scene where they leave together.  In CoG, we learn that Credence, *according to Grindelwald*, is actually Aurealis Dumbledore. Given what we know about Dumbledore (Albus) and Grindelwald’s relationship, if it’s true that Grindelwald was also in love with Albus, it’s possible that *he’s grooming Credence as a replacement for Albus.*  Think on that for a bit."

3012,the idea of a child theleta theory spoiler hi there a small theory about leta and later on theseus relationship to their past and how it might effect theirs not in a negative way enjoy _______________________________________________________________________________________ a little voice inside her head throughout the second movie leta is haunted by a sort of vision of her little brother drowing i believe it s not just the chance of someone who potentially could have bonded with her in some way despite corvus influence but also great fear of having an own child i do believe she wanted a future with theseus and children but was terrified of how she could never forget what had happened to her brother and how responsible she felt i think theseus didn t know about her past but maybe can relate to how she feels since very likely he carries guilt as well _________________________________________________________________________ man myth reject so far we know that he saved the lives of muggles during wwi but during war one can never save every life and i m pretty sure he has rather painfull feelings about being called a war hero technically he cannot be blamed either since he only tried to help but just like her he may not be able to live with how he influenced who lived and died although it may likely have happened anyway considering this the pasts and feelings they are battling with actually come very close leta was just a child that wanted to sleep and theseus a young man who wanted to protect people and they both struggle also in almost  years of working as an auror theseus had to kill people in some situations and i think it s even more clear how he feels about this when he mentions to newt how he doesn t like to have a bounty hunter involved in the hunts mission either he seems to feel at this point that sometimes there s no other way to ensure the life and well being of the majority but it doesn t feel right to him it s actually something tina may be able to relate to as well in her case we can only talk about   years of active law enforcement and no involvement in wwi but there must have been some cases of self defense etc in her history as well while newt struggles with the unintentional death of the sudanese girl he only tried to help there are very well placed parallels between the two couple s traumata it s very interesting i really wonder if this is going to be brought up at some point makes for a nice message of how it s important and often very helpfull to talk about what weighs on you with people who know what it feels like getting back to topic i believe theseus would have liked tp have children as well but on his part couldn t live with the chance of them loving/looking up to him and not knowing about what he thinks he has done _______________________________________________________ shared pain i d actually really like to see if leta should turn out to be alive a storyline in which they reveal their respective burdens to each other maybe even in relation to leta having given birth to a child by the third movie and realize on a deeper basis why they belong together they see what the other

Well, before we start, I have to say that I don't consider Cursed Child canon, it is not canon for me . we know that once the main characters finished school, they all go looking for jobs : Harry became the Head of The Auror Department in The Ministry, Hermione works in The Ministry as well ( I don't remember which part of the Ministry so please help !! ) the official Harry Potter Wiki also mentioned that she became a writer as well, Ron initially worked in Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, helping George with running the business but eventually quit to become an Auror and joined Harry and Hermione in the Ministry, Ginny became a Quidditch Player playing for the Holyhead Harpies, Neville became the new Herbology teacher at Hogwarts and thus becomes the new Head of Hufflepuff House ( even though he is a Gryffindor ) and Luna became a famous Wizarding Naturalist . So my question is, what is Draco's job ?! Is he working in the Ministry too ?! Or his family is so rich that he doesn't feel the need to go to work to support his family ?! Was it ever mentioned at all ?"

However, later in the film we see Newt transforming into his brother and his voice remains to be his. Why? Mistake or what? 2) How did British Ministry of Magic know that Credence is alive, when it was believed at the end of the first movie that he is dead. They never explained his survival. 3) This question is about nobody from muggle world being able to see when Grindelwald was transported from Macusa. I mean, they went below bridge and alighted on the river at some point. Then they went upwards and that was somewhere in the middle of the city. I had the same question when they were transporting Harry in the Deathly Hallows. (Hagrid rushed straight to the road lol) Everybody could see them.

4005,leta and theseus a spy story hi there i've already posted a theory on how the engagement of leta lestrange and theseus scamander was possibly based on love potion or experimental magic yet recently another conclusion popped up in my head what if they're not in love but acting as spies for the two sides of the upcoming war _____________________________ theseus we know so far that theseus is the head of the aurors department in the british ministry of magic when grindelwald escapes in  and starts to gather followers there may be concerns in the ministry that a widely known family of dark wizards the lestranges may soonly be joining his forces they decide it's best to keep an eye on them several and especially one of them that theseus has known for a long time since she was his brothers best friend not only could he have agreed to this because he knows her and her family are at risk to join grindelwald but also because she's known for experiments maybe even skilled at this and allegedly confused and damaged grindelwald could be interested in her talents if she isn't already in and has orders as well ________________________________________________________ leta there are two options what leta's part in this could be she is a follower of grindelwald and was asked to join not only for her blood and knowledge but also for that she had a connection to theseus scamander he's a very active figure in the hunt for grindelwald who surely would like him out of the way yet killing him would not only start a riot within the ministry but also take away the option to spy on it through somebody else yet i'm not sure how that works yet he must have taken care of that she won't get any information yet once he believes she is innocent she knows exactly why theseus is trying to bond with her and feeds him information in small doses to help the other side always making sure the dark side doesn't suspect her yet what if she does that to make the ministry believe she is on their side what if once it's all revealed she secretly still follows grindelwald what if she turns away from him towards the end of the series she is aware of theseus' plan and slowly tries to turn him to the greater good ideology in very small doses so he barely notices it maybe he plays along to fullfill his role as spy but starts to question is ideals and she may be the one who came up with a romantic relationship and eventual engagement knowing he would agree to not to lose her as a source of information __________________________________ to sum it up they may both act as spies for the

And she may be the one who came up with a romantic relationship and eventual engagement - knowing he would agree to not to lose her as a source of information  __________________________________  To sum it up, they may both act as spies for the other side - maybe even knowing about each others plans, but playing along - **for a Greater Good.**  ________________________________________________  This theory is still very vague and crumbled... let me know if you have something to help me with this :)"

JKR screwed up her own story again, my friends. -sigh- Wasn’t cursed child and the history of Dumbledore changed in Fantastic Beasts, enough damage? No, she has to go and ruin the history of our dear Harry as well.  We all know for basically a fact, that the way the Marauder’s Map was created, was because of the Potter invisibility cloak. After all, wouldn’t you notice a stag, a dog, or rat trying to “sneak” around Hogwarts castle? I sure would! Therefore, I think the only explanation for the Map is that James Potter had the Cloak during his school years at Hogwarts castle.  BUT...  J. K. Rowling writes on Pottermore:  “Fleamont and Euphemia lived long enough to see James marry a Muggle-born girl called Lily Evans, but not to meet their grandson, Harry. Dragon pox carried them off within days of each other, due to their advanced age, and James Potter then inherited Ignotus Peverell’s Invisibility Cloak.”  if James potter did not get the cloak until after his Hogwarts years, when he married, how the heck did he make the Map with his friends and sneak around Hogwarts castle without being detected?  Please, I beg of you to answer this. Please prove me wrong and show that I have not found another plot hole in her recent writing."

2262,for the greater good i just finished my rereading of the series and chapter  kings cross was really well done and explained a lot of things that could and should be included in the fantastic beasts series not only did dumbledore explain about how voldemort had a major flaw in his plan he gave us more insight in his past involving grindelwald his family and the deathly hallows as a student in hogwarts he was a gifted wizard and he had a bright future ahead of him but he had pain inside him because his six year old sister named ariana was bullied by muggles who spied on her though a garden hedge she was using magic that she couldn t control yet that day she was afraid of using magic for the rest of her short life percival the father found the muggles who attacked her and was sent to azkaban for assaulting them instead of admitting that his daughter was mad he accepted his life in the wizard prison kendra the mother moved them to godric s hallow where she kept her daughter inside for her safety everyone thought ariana was a squib but she was most likely an obscurial since she was said to be very dangerous when ariana was fourteen she accidentally killed her own mother since she couldn t control herself and her mother couldn t calm her down only aberforth could but he was at hogwarts instead of traveling with his friend elphias doge albus had to go back home to look after the unstable sister he hated it because he knew he had a bright future he could be anywhere and doing anything he wanted but he was stuck caring for his sister so naturally he longed for more even if he loved his family then one day grindelwald decided to travel to godric s hallow because he was looking for the hallows and he stayed with his great aunt bathilda bagshot during the summer who happened to be neighbors with dumbledore for two whole months these friends were inseparable making up plans to conquer the wizarding world together and be the masters of death with the hallows albus lost his dad to muggles his sister was bullied by them so naturally he had resentment towards them only made worse by gellert it was for the greater good which was their slogan dumbledore fell for grindelwald because he was free he was an equal he was manipulating albus he was in pain he wanted more and grindelwald was the solution at least he though that for a long time albus knew grindelwald was a dark wizard but he told himself otherwise until aberforth showed up to end their friendship since albus was neglecting his sister and grindelwald fought first until all three of them were dueling until ariana was hit by a spell and was dead albus finally realized he was in the wrong and was manipulated by his best friend the whole relationship was for two months and for those two months grindelwald had only two things in his mind the hallows and to conquer the wizarding world with or without dumbledore jk rowling announced that dumbledore was gay which i accept i see how he fell for grindelwald and i can see how grindelwald fell for dumbledore what i don t see is them having a sexual relationship or kissing and etc it was strictly emotional and their number one goal is to be the master of death to conquer the world there was no time for any of that sort except emotionally into each other none would actually come forth with it especially grindelwald since he was only using dumbledore but he eventually fell for him which i m sure he would ignore as much as possible what dumbledore said in this chapter explained it perfectly i might get hate for this by people who want them to show kissing and what not but don t you all agree that it would be out of character and just better to show them being emotionally involved with one another through the fantastic beasts

the Greater Good”. I just finished my rereading of the series and chapter 35: Kings Cross, was really well done and explained a lot of things that could and should be included in the Fantastic Beasts series. Not only did Dumbledore explain about how Voldemort had a major flaw in his plan  , he gave us more insight in his past involving Grindelwald, his family, and the Deathly   Hallows.    As a student in Hogwarts he was a gifted wizard and he had a bright future ahead of him. But he had pain inside him because his six year old sister named Ariana was bullied by muggles who spied on her though a garden hedge, she was using magic that she couldn’t control yet. That day she was afraid of using magic for the rest of her short life. Percival, the father, found the muggles who attacked her, and was sent to Azkaban for assaulting them. Instead of admitting that his daughter was mad, he accepted his life in the wizard prison.   Kendra, the mother, moved them to Godric’s Hallow where she kept her daughter inside for her safety. Everyone thought Ariana was a Squib, but she was most likely an Obscurial, since she was said to be very dangerous. When Ariana was fourteen she accidentally killed her own mother since she couldn’t control herself, and her mother couldn’t calm her down, only Aberforth could, but he was at Hogwarts.   Instead of traveling with his friend Elphias Doge, Albus had to go back home to look after the unstable sister. He hated it because he knew he had a bright future, he could be anywhere and doing anything he wanted, but he was stuck caring for his sister, so naturally he longed for more, even if he loved his family.   Then one day Grindelwald decided to travel to Godric’s hallow because he was looking for the Hallows and he stayed with his great-aunt Bathilda Bagshot during the summer, who happened to be neighbors with Dumbledore. For two whole months these friends were inseparable making up plans to conquer the Wizarding world together and be the Masters of Death with the Hallows. Albus lost his dad to muggles, his sister was bullied by them, so naturally he had resentment towards them, only made worse by Gellert.  It was for “The Greater Good “, which was their slogan. Dumbledore fell for Grindelwald because he was free, he was an equal, he was manipulating Albus, he was in pain, he wanted more and Grindelwald was the solution, at least he though that. For a long time Albus knew Grindelwald was a dark wizard, but he told himself otherwise until Aberforth showed up to end their friendship since Albus was neglecting his sister, and Grindelwald fought first until all three of them were dueling, until Ariana was hit by a spell and was dead. Albus finally realized he was in the wrong and was manipulated by his best friend.   The whole relationship was for two months and for those two months Grindelwald had only two things in his mind, the Hallows and to conquer the Wizarding World, with or without Dumbledore. Jk Rowling announced that Dumbledore was gay, which I accept. I see how he fell for Grindelwald. And I can see how Grindelwald fell for Dumbledore. What I don’t see is them having a sexual relationship or kissing and etc. It was strictly emotional and their number one goal is to be the Master Of Death to conquer the world. There was no time for any of that sort, except emotionally into each other. None would actually come forth with it, especially Grindelwald since he was only using Dumbledore, but he eventually  fell for him, which I’m sure he would ignore as much as possible. What Dumbledore said in this chapter explained it perfectly. I might get hate for this by people who want them to show kissing and what not. But don’t you all agree that it would be out of character? And just better to show them being emotionally involved with one another through the Fantastic Beasts series?"

Never understood Dumbledore’s reasoning for not telling Harry that Voldemort would try to send him fake visions to lure him into the Department of Mysteries which is why he had Snape teach Harry how to block his mind. I mean he knows that Harry hates Snape and vice versa thus he’ll have a hard time keeping himself cool (an essential in Occlumency). If Dumbledore wants Harry to apply himself in Occlumency, then he best way to do so is to give Harry a motive for learning, in this case making sure Voldemort doesn’t take advantage of their connection to invade Harry’s mind. Tell Harry that as long as the connection exists, Voldemort could use it to spy on Dumbledore and the Order which is why Dumbledore has been avoiding him all year or worse, Voldy May try to possess him as he was possessing Nagini at the time. Given how paranoid Harry was abt the possibility of Voldemort possessing him after witnessing the attack on Mr Weasley, no doubt Harry would’ve jumped on the chance of learning how to keep Voldemort from invading his mind if he knew that was the point of his Occlumency lessons. The Order members for some reason or other seem to be board with not telling Harry why he needs to learn Occlumency even though they know he’s stuck with Snape whom he despises and likely to be miserable. When Harry told Sirius and Lupin that Snape had stopped teaching him, at that point either one of them should’ve said “Voldemort is trying to lure you to the Department of Mysteries via fake visions to get you killed. That’s why we had you learning Occlumency!”"

3312,spoiler corvus/credence twins a different theory twins  it is unlikely that corvus sr would have sent his beloved baby corvus to the us with a maid to be created in an orphange by mary lou  leta lestrange did not need to be on that boat unlike baby corvus she was not in danger as she was not loved by corvus sr  even if she was coruvs sr wouldn't care about her and her being in the us would only give away the identity of baby corvus which was supposedly being hidden from yusuf  baby corvus is probably alive because yusuf still has the scars from the unbreakable vow  so the theory is that corvus sr had twins baby corvus and a squib no one knew about the squib except perhaps the maid  he sent the maid with leta and the squib to the us to be raised by mary lou  everyone would have thought the baby on the boat was baby corvus because leta and the maid were there with him  on the same boat he sent true baby corvus with his aunt which would raise him in the us until fake baby corvus was killed by yusuf she would then bring ture baby corvus back claiming to be her son  corvus sr thought yusuf would eventually trace down and kill the wrong baby in the us thus the need for leta and the maid to be with fake corvus  but the accident happened and the babies were exchanged the aunt eventually came back and told corvus sr that baby corvus had drowned not knowing that that babies had been exchanged  he then mourned the death of his son which he believed had drowned and the knews of the death of baby corvus were spread  because there was no point in protecting the squib he despised corvus sr let the kid be raised by mary lou and brought leta back to england  he didn't know however that that kid was the true baby corvus because leta had never told anyone she had switched the babies  in the dialogue between dumbledore and leta he talks as if corvus was dead yusuf also mentions that someone somehow took him out of the water meaning that the story that was told was that corvus had drowned  leda believed that was a false story created by her father to trick yusuf and that her father believed corvus was still alive in the us as she was the only one who knew about the baby exchange  grindenwald was close to corvus sr and heard the true story from his perspective that corvus had drowned and the squib survived and was in ny being raised as an orphan that is why grindenwald calls credence a squib and doubts he could be the obscurian  after he finds out that creedence is the actual obscurian grindenwald goes after the lestrange book in paris and realizes what had happened he then modifies the family tree to show only  dead son of corvus sr called corvus and brings leta and credende to the pere lachaise where the rumors about credence being a lestrange are proven to be false  that was necessary in order for grindenwald to lead credence into believing he was a dumbledore and to try to kill dumbledore while he is actually true baby corvus  as to the squib he probably did not die he was saved by someone or an animal horned serpent maybe the same animal that destroyed the boat as yusuf might have felt because of his vow the fact that dumbledore says the obscurian needs a brother to replace the obscurus and the fact that leda died also support the theory of twins also we never see the actual baby only the blanket let's now match the story with the prophecy a son cruelly banished corvus was not cruelly banished he was being protected that reinforces the idea of twins the squib was cruelly banished despair of the daughter that clearly refers to leta return great avenger the squib will probably return in the movies he was maybe raised as a muggle in the us and we may see him fighting in wwii or maybe he actually had magical powers

A different theory (twins):  1 - It is unlikely that Corvus Sr. would have sent his beloved baby Corvus to the US with a maid, to be created in an orphange by Mary Lou.  2 - Leta Lestrange did not need to be on that boat; unlike baby Corvus, she was not in danger, as she was not loved by Corvus Sr.  3- Even if she was, Coruvs Sr. wouldn't care about her, and her being in the US would only give away the identity of baby Corvus, which was supposedly being hidden from Yusuf.  4 - Baby Corvus is probably alive because Yusuf still has the scars from the unbreakable vow.  5 - So the theory is that Corvus Sr. had twins, baby Corvus and a squib. No one knew about the squib, except perhaps the maid.  6 - He sent the maid with Leta and the squib to the US to be raised by Mary Lou.  7 - Everyone would have thought the baby on the boat was baby Corvus, because Leta and the maid were there with him.  4 - On the same boat, he sent true baby Corvus with his aunt, which would raise him in the US until fake baby Corvus was killed by Yusuf. She would then bring ture baby Corvus back claiming to be her son.  5- Corvus Sr. thought Yusuf would eventually trace down and kill the wrong baby in the US, thus the need for Leta and the maid to be with fake Corvus.  6 - But the accident happened and the babies were exchanged. The aunt eventually came back and told Corvus Sr. that baby Corvus had drowned, not knowing that that babies had been exchanged.  7 - He then mourned the death of his son, which he believed had drowned, and the knews of the death of baby Corvus were spread.  8 - Because there was no point in protecting the ""squib"" he despised, Corvus Sr. let the kid be raised by Mary Lou, and brought Leta back to England.  9 - He didn't know however that that kid was the true baby Corvus, because Leta had never told anyone she had switched the babies.  10 - In the dialogue between Dumbledore and Leta, he talks as if Corvus was dead. Yusuf also mentions that ""someone somehow took him out of the water"", meaning that the story that was told was that Corvus had drowned.  11 - Leda believed that was a false story created by her father to trick Yusuf, and that her father believed Corvus was still alive in the US (as she was the only one who knew about the baby exchange).  12 - Grindenwald was close to Corvus Sr., and heard the true story from his perspective: that Corvus had drowned and the squib survived and was in NY being raised as an orphan. That is why Grindenwald calls Credence a squib and doubts he could be the obscurian.  13 - After he finds out that Creedence is the actual obscurian, Grindenwald goes after the Lestrange book in Paris, and realizes what had happened. He then modifies the family tree to show only 1 dead son of Corvus Sr. called Corvus, and brings Leta and Credende to the Pere Lachaise, where the rumors about Credence being a Lestrange are proven to be false.  14 - That was necessary in order for Grindenwald to lead Credence into believing he was a Dumbledore (and to try to kill Dumbledore), while he is actually true baby Corvus.  15 - As to the squib, he probably did not die. He was saved by someone (or an animal? Horned serpent? Maybe the same animal that destroyed the boat) as Yusuf might have ""felt"" because of his vow. The fact that Dumbledore says the Obscurian needs a brother to replace the obscurus, and the fact that Leda died, also support the theory of twins. Also, we never see the actual baby, only the blanket.  Let's now match the story with the prophecy:  ""A Son Cruelly Banished.""  Corvus was not cruelly banished, he was being protected. That reinforces the idea of twins: the squib was cruelly banished.  ""Despair of the Daughter.""  That clearly refers to Leta.  ""Return, great avenger.""  The squib will probably return in the movies. He was maybe raised as a muggle in the US, and we may see him fighting in WWII. Or maybe he actually had magical powers and was raised at Ilvermorny, and that's how we get to see the school.  With winds from the water.”  So, maybe he comes back ""from the water"" on the D-Day to fight Grindenwald in 1944? Maybe he comes back flying on the back of a magical creature...the hornet serpent again?"
2900,sorting my hero academia characters into hogwarts houses for the my hero academia harry potter fans i thought this would be interesting to discuss especially since a lot of these characters you

Academia characters into Hogwarts houses For the My Hero Academia Harry Potter fans I thought this would be interesting to discuss especially since a lot of these characters you can argue belong in different houses, so let's start with class 1A  Gryffindor  Bakugou - difficult to place because he does have a lot of Slytherin being ambitious but his pure borderline suicidal bravery leans him towards Gryffindor, plus when faced with the choice of turning into a villain he immediately rejected it without even thinking about it.  Deku - Also fiercely brave as well as loyal to his friends even when they are being dicks to him *cough* Bakugou *cough*  Mina Ashido - her backstory she was shown to be brave, standing up to bullies and is generally a outgoing bubbly person who fits in with Gryffindor  Iida - loyal to his friends while also willing to stand up to them, incredibly skilled and brave (would probably be the Gryffindor prefect)  Kaminari - bit of a troublemaker but has shown to be brave when protecting his friends   Hufflepuff   Kirishima - incredibly hard working and deeply values and will do anything for a friend  Mezo Shoji - calm and level headed, generally quiet while also there for his friends   Tooru - honestly only putting her here because her character has barely been developed, same goes for Sato  Ojiro - values fairness in competition and even gave deku advice in the tournament arc  Sero - hard working and kind person  Ravenclaw  Momo - 6/5 intelligence basically a genius, also shown to be well mannered and creative so she is a insta Ravenclaw for the sorting hat  Koji Koda - quiet and shy person who has been shown to be smart with knowing hand language   Tokoyami - very analytical in his thinking, very well spoken while being a bit mysterious as well. Also he is literally a bird so lol  Tsuyu Asui - shown to be very intelligent in both academics and combat as well as having a great intuition about people  Slytherin  Ochaco Uraraka - if your a fan of the show this is going to be a bit controversial putting her in Slytherin but I'm putting her hear because of her ambition and how her actions in the series are her chasing her goal of providing for her family.   Sports Festival she was very cunning and despite being outclassed by Bakugou was able to come up with a plan to almost beating him and she was driven by a specific goal. It's a toss up between Ravenclaw and Slytherin (honestly this is hardball territory) but I have to put in Slytherin, plus this a good example of not all Slytherins are dicks/evil since Uraraka is the nicest person in the class  Todoroki - was bread to be elite and is extremely driven by proving he is not his father  Mineta - very ambitious goals of wanting to get laid lol  Aoyama - Aoyama is a very interesting character because of his character being shrouded in mystery. Puts on a facade  of a flamboyant character when deep down he is using it as a mask for his insecurities, knows people very well and fits Slytherin perfectly   Jirou - has a bit of a crass personality while still being a nice person, shown to be cunning in combat   If your a BnHA fan what do you think, just thought it be fun to talk about"

Okay, hear me out.  So we all know JK is a master wordsmith when it comes to naming her characters... I'm listening to the HP books again via audiobooks and I'm listening to book 2 where Harry meets Fawkes. So this has got me thinking.  Fawkes is an awesome Phoenix name anyway, and a quick Google search shows the origin as 'falcon' which is fitting for, you know, a majestic bird.  But i've always assumed Fawkes was a reference to Bonfire Night/Guy Fawkes Night. Again obvious reference of fire to the firebird.   BUT basically this means that Dumbledore's pet is named after one of British history's most famous rebels. Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Westminster Palace with gunpowder. He failed, but this is weirdly celebrated every November with fireworks.   Knowing what we know about JK's web of plot intricacies, is it possible that by Fawkes also represents the exsisting and eventual destruction of trust between Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic?  Or am I just thinking waaaay too much into this one."

So i'm going to Universal Orlando next week for the first time ever (yay, super excited!!

I'm going alone (husband has a different event in Orlando on the same day, plus he has no interest in HP at all), but I still got an express pass because I only have the one day and it will probably be crazy busy.

I have been thinking about creating a story or wanting to read a story about some wizards, escaping from the prison of Azkaban, trying to steal gold from the bank.   The story would show different uses of magic than depicted in Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It would show depth and another part of the wizarding world.   As for the timeline, I would not know when this heist would take place.  Thank you for reading and I hope it sounds somewhat interesting."

The most important: one they showed us young Newt' holding a raven chick for a reason. Actually for two reasons: we can see it's the same bird that Credence found. And second, it is said that the raven is a symbol of the Lestrange family  2). Grindelwald is incredibly talented in transfiguration. At the beginning of the film he was using transfiguration, not the polyjuice potion (officially confirmed) to change looks with Abernathy for a quite long period, before the tongue was cut off, so he could possibly make a raven look like a phoenix.  3). Yusuf still has scars from Unbreakable vow, so Corvus is possibly still alive.  4). Corvus Sr. and GG knew each other, that's how GG learned about his identity. That's why they stole Lestrange family Tree and modified it, and they killed Irma Dugard.   5). GG is almost always lying and would do anything to kill Dumbledore  6). Corvus Lestrange was shown as the last male Lestrange at the family tree, but we know that Lestrange continued to exist  So my thoughts are that the babies were double swapped, it means, they were swapped first before they went to the ship, because they were aware that Yusuf would try to kill them. Only the woman who was looking after real Corvus, knew that it actually is him, but she died as well. The baby who was with Leta and Irma was crying all the time because he was a random kidnapped baby, who didn't know anyone around him"

If they never talk after the fight, how do they make the pact? Why would they make it and part ways? And they couldn't make the pact and then fight each other.  My theory: D &  G make the pact not to fight as a sign of their love for each other. They realise Ariana is an obscurial, and have conflicting opinions on what to do about her (study vs help, save her vs use her 'for the greater good' or something like that). Ariana overhears them arguing and releases the obscurus, D &  G try calming her down and resort to magic, accidentally killing her. This is the major thing that rips them apart, also leading them to believe in different ideas.  Remember that we never hear that D &  G fought each other from either of them directly, only from other people who could have been lied to."

I’ve been listening to the Stephen Fry narrated audiobooks and I am enjoying the story (again) so very much. I love how I find something new on each read through.   I just listened to “The Parting of the Ways”, chapter 36 of The Goblet of Fire, and was struck by how poignant the scene where molly hugs Harry is:  “The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to over him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.  ‘It wasn’t your fault, Harry,’ Mrs Weasley whispered.  ‘I told him to take the cup with me,’ said Harry.  Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away.  Mrs Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing his face up against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.  There was a loud slamming noise , and Mrs Weasley and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand. ‘Sorry,’ she whispered.”  Does anyone know why Hermione says sorry? I’ve always interpreted this passage to mean that she intentionally made the sound to break Harry and Molly apart, but I’m not sure why? How does everyone else interpret this scene?   Also, this has got to be a condenser for one of my favourite scenes in the entire series. The howl of misery..being hugged as if by a mother. So vivid and heartbreaking. Anyone else have any favourites similar to this?"

I believe the curse was either done by Letas father's family the lestranges or his first wife. Because I really believe back in their era their was also racial tensions as well and her mother and father's marriage was frowned upon. I also believe the new companion screenplay feature kelipes and not dragons scrolled in gold on the cover. Any ideas?????

And for some reason it's hard to separate the way I feel about  the fictional Slytherin-me from the way I feel about myself in real life--the two things kind of bleed into each other, as I'm sure most people here understand intuitively. I love Slytherin conceptually and as roleplay, but I feel very weird considering myself Slytherin-like in real life. Any others feel the same about their House? Or am I the only one with this particular conflict?"

3680,cog another reason why we shouldn't believe that thing spoiler we have all heard about the timeline not lining up with the birth of credence and him being the brother of albus and aberforth and many other reasons why basically everything grindelwald says at the end of the movie is a lie however i would like to focus on a fact that should make even angry and slightly mad credence suspicious about grindelwald what many people seem to forget are the information we can get from the first fantastic beasts movie especially before the big credence is the obscurial reveal grindelwald or graves at that point uses credence to look for the obscurial and it doesn't even cross his mind it could be him simply because he is too old this is first dead giveaway that points to the fact that even grindelwald probably doesn't know anything about credence or knows the truth but doesn't want to say it another problem appears straight away during the same scene grindelwald tells credence he has no idea whether he is looking for a boy or a girl and then suddenly a few months later knows even credences real name of course he can say he has learnt the truth just recently but i guess even credence would be suspicious about it and lastly there is this little hint hidden in the name dropped at the end of the movie we all know j k loves her foreshadowing and hiding meanings everywhere she can it can be a bit far stretched but stay with me for a while aurelius dumbledore who else shares that name almost everyone has ever heard about marcus aurelius and that's pretty much it i'm not a big history geek but i just remembered this little thing about marcus aurelius he was one of the adopted emperors if i'm not mistaken that means he was chosen beforehand to succeed as a ruler he wan't bound by blood to the previous emperor so in my mind his name is basically adopted dumbledore d i believe there is nothing connecting him to the dumbledore brothers except perhaps the obsucur inside of him i could of course continue about how ariana's obscurus could have been attached to credence somehow so he would be in a way a brother to albus and aberforth because part of ariana's soul would be a part of him etc but that has been said many times already in the past days what dou you think,cog anoth reason whi we shouldn't believ that thing spoiler we have all heard about the timelin not

However, I would like to focus on a fact that should make even angry and slightly-mad Credence suspicious about Grindelwald.  & #   What many people seem to forget are the information we can get from the first Fantastic Beasts movie, especially before the big ""Credence is the obscurial"" reveal.

904,opinion/rant fantastic beasts as a film series is better than the harry potter series as a film series and the hatred it gets is largely blind and pre determined as a film series it s miles better than the potter film series was two installments in sorry miles and from a standpoint of craftsmanship it marks a high point for the series as has been said by multiple film critics i think we need to reconsider for example our thoughts on philosopher s stone chamber of secrets and order of the phoenix if we re seriously acting like fucking crimes of grindelwald is a low point my fuck i like the fantastic beasts series because they re much more complex they confront taboo themes in interesting and mature ways it allows rowling s world building to shine and its not boringly confined to one location it detailed and far more artistically and thematically ambitious it s complex whereas harry potter was way too simplistic and boring at least in film form the more i consider the criticism of the fantastic beasts series the more i m seeing how non fans are dominating the narrative surrounding it there are  videos a day from a bunch of random youtube accounts that previously never posted shit about harry potter that all of a sudden have an opinion on an installment of the franchise and please i followed the discourse surrounding both fb films before they opened after fb1 despite the positive reviews there was a huge amount of shit slinging and nit picking for absolutely no reason with relatively shallow and outright poorly constructed criticisms that clearly stemmed from people s lack of understanding of the plot for example it was just about finding creatures it was boring well no it wasn t and it obviously wasn t so i really do not have time to even entertain this criticism the entire film was about grindelwald attacking nyc with the obscurus credence barebone in an effort to expose the wizarding community the beasts were a cover for that effort as they explicitly stated in the dialogue but these people didn t care about that they wanted to maintain their version of the story simply to justify their reductive view that this series wasn t important/was childish/was too simplistic and i heard another people say that the film was too simple/low stakes well all of a sudden these people sit down for crimes of grindelwald and are gasp shocked to find out that the series is gasp complex and dark and features said obscurus trying to discover who he is amidst the manipulation of the ensemble cast of characters that draws them all to the rally held by grindelwald in which they chose sides the frustration and therefore the negativity that some people feel toward the film is somewhat understandable as it functions like a part two and does not therefore close or develop all if it s characters and narrative strands to the fullest extent but the superlatively negative lashing that the film has received is so obviously burdened with pre determined hatred and potter haters just willing failure on the series that i can t remotely entertain the constant aggressive proselytizing about how the film sucks and you should think it does too look there s always objectivity in entertainment and in film criticism in particular but when you reach such extremes and preach such hyperbole about a film being the worst film of a series/the month/the year or alternately the best film ever you need to provide valid arguments and justification to back that statement up and simply no one has when it comes to crimes of grindelwald there are some things worth criticizing such as the fast and loose editing and the insufficient running time and again i understand some people s frustration with how incomplete some of it feels due to the serialized nature of this  part story but these are little criticisms at best and constant rote cliché accusations and imputations of plot holes and bad writing or insistences that the series is just rotten to the core and needs to simplify itself/ change the entire overarching narrative for you to like it are such lame low effort highly personal ignorant criticisms and they just do not cut it and provide no solid base on which to place such grandiose accusations of the film franchise being trash or even just poorly made this on top of the outrageous amount of unwarranted controversy and abuse rowling got before the film came out as well as the snide dismissive treatment the film got for absolute no reason at all from members of the entertainment media mocking the title of the film getting mad that the film ended up on most anticipated movies of the fall season polls or insisting that it would fail at the box office sort of drives home that the bulk of the criticism around the film and the negative hyperbole just isn t warranted at all it looks like a bunch of non fans and haters jumping at the chance/formulating excuses to trash a successful franchise and when all else fails this franchise is already a billion dollars rich cog improved upon the overseas performance of the original the original film was positively reviewed the audience response while more lukewarm than usual was decent as indicated by imdb google rt cinemascore and metacritic and the franchise has already earned itself an oscar and a bafta cog was nominated for a bafta and numerous guild awards the fact that people are jumping at the bit to classify the franchise a failure on top of all this just demonstrates that the criticism is irrational and forced,opinion/r fantast beast as a film seri is better than the harri potter seri as a film seri and the hatr it get is larg blind and pre determin as a film seri it s mile better than the potter film seri wa two instal in sorri mile and from a standpoint of craftsmanship it mark a high point for the seri as ha been said by multipl film critic i think we need to reconsid for exampl our thought on philosoph s stone chamber of secret and order of the phoenix if we re serious act like fuck crime of grindelwald is a low point my fuck i like the fantast beast seri becaus they re much more complex they confront taboo theme in interest and matur way it allow rowl s world build to shine and it not boringli confin to one locat it detail and far more artist and themat ambiti it s complex wherea harri potter wa way too simplist and bore at least in film form the more i consid the critic of the fantast beast seri the more i m see how non fan are domin the narr surround it there are  video a day from a bunch of random youtub account that previous never post shit about harri potter that all of a sudden have an opinion on an instal of the franchis and pleas i follow the discours surround both fb film befor they open after fb1 despit the posit review there wa a huge amount of shit sling and nit pick for absolut no reason with rel shallow and outright poorli construct critic that clearli stem from peopl s lack of understand of the plot for exampl it wa just about find creatur it wa bore well no it wasn t and it obvious wasn t so i realli do not have time to even entertain thi critic the entir film wa about grindelwald attack nyc with the obscuru credenc barebon in an effort to expos the wizard commun the beast were a cover for that effort as they explicitli state in the dialogu but these peopl didn t care about that they want to maintain their version of the stori simpli to justifi their reduct view that thi seri wasn t important/wa childish/wa too simplist and i heard anoth peopl say that the film wa too simple/low stake well all of a sudden these peopl sit down for crime of grindelwald and are gasp shock to find out that the seri is gasp complex and dark and featur said obscuru tri to discov who he is amidst the manipul of the ensembl cast of charact that draw them all to the ralli held by grindelwald in which they chose side the frustrat and therefor the neg that some peopl feel toward the film is somewhat understand as it function like a part two and doe not therefor close or develop all if it s charact and narr strand to the fullest extent but the superl neg lash that the film ha receiv is so obvious burden with pre determin hatr and potter hater just will failur on the seri that i can t remot entertain the constant aggress proselyt about how the film suck and you should think it doe too look there s alway object in entertain and in film critic in particular but when you reach such extrem and preach such hyperbol about a film be the worst film of a series/th month/th year or altern the best film ever you need to provid valid argument and justif to back that statement up and simpli no one ha when it come to crime of grindelwald there are some thing worth critic such as the fast and

reduct view that thi seri wasn t important/wa childish/wa too simplist and i heard anoth peopl say that the film wa too simple/low stake well all of a sudden these peopl sit down for crime of

to the ralli held by grindelwald in which they chose side the frustrat and therefor the neg that some peopl feel toward the film is somewhat understand as it function like a part two and doe not

to back that statement up and simpli no one ha when it come to crime of grindelwald there are some thing worth critic such as the fast and loos edit and the insuffici run time and again i understand some peopl s frustrat with how incomplet some of it feel due to the serial natur of thi  part stori but these are littl critic at best and constant rote cliché accus and imput of plot hole and bad write or insist that the seri is just rotten to the core and need to simplifi itself/ chang the entir overarch narr for you to like it are such lame low effort highli person ignor critic and they just do not cut it and provid no solid base on which to place such grandios accus of the film franchis be trash or even just poorli made thi on top of the outrag amount of unwarr controversi and abus rowl

on most anticip movi of the fall season poll or insist that it would fail at the box offic sort of drive home that the bulk of the critic around the film and the neg hyperbol just isn t warrant at all it look like a bunch of non fan and hater jump at the chance/formul excus to trash a success franchis and when all els fail thi franchis is alreadi a billion dollar rich cog improv upon the oversea

itself an oscar and a bafta cog wa nomin for a bafta and numer guild award the fact that peopl are jump at the bit to classifi the franchis a failur on top of all thi just demonstr that the critic is irrat and forc,"Opinion/Rant: Fantastic Beasts (as a film series) is better than the Harry Potter series (as a film series), and the hatred it gets is largely blind and pre-determined As a film series, it’s MILES better than the Potter film series was, two installments in. Sorry, MILES, and from a standpoint of craftsmanship, it marks a high point for the series, as has been said by multiple film critics. I think we need to reconsider, for example, our thoughts on Philosopher’s Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Order of the Phoenix if we’re seriously acting like fucking CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD is a low point. My fuck.   I like the Fantastic Beasts series because they’re much more complex. They confront taboo themes in interesting and mature ways. It allows Rowling’s world-building to shine, and its not boringly confined to one location. It detailed and far more artistically and thematically ambitious. It’s complex, whereas Harry Potter was WAY too simplistic and boring, at least in film form.   The more I consider the criticism of the Fantastic Beasts series, the more I’m seeing how non-fans are dominating the narrative surrounding it. There are 3 videos a day from a bunch of random YouTube accounts that previously never posted *shit* about Harry Potter that all of a sudden have an opinion on an installment of the franchise.   And please, I followed the discourse surrounding both FB films before they opened. After FB1, despite the positive reviews, there was a huge amount of shit-slinging and nit-picking for absolutely no reason, with relatively shallow and outright poorly constructed criticisms that clearly stemmed from people’s lack of understanding of the plot.   For example:   “IT WAS JUST ABOUT FINDING CREATURES. It was boring!”  Well, no, it wasn’t, and it obviously wasn’t, so I really do not have time to even entertain this criticism. The entire film was about Grindelwald attacking NYC with the Obscurus, Credence Barebone, in an effort to expose the Wizarding community. The beasts were a cover for that effort, as they explicitly stated in the dialogue.   But these people didn’t care about that, they wanted to maintain *their* version of the story, simply to justify their reductive view that this series “wasn’t important/was childish/was too simplistic” (and I heard another people say that the film was “too simple/low-stakes”.) Well, all of a sudden, these people sit down for Crimes of Grindelwald, and are *gasp* SHOCKED to find out that the series is *gasp* COMPLEX. And DARK. And features said OBSCURUS trying to discover who he is amidst the manipulation of the ensemble cast of characters, that draws them all to the rally held by Grindelwald, in which they chose sides.   The frustration and therefore the negativity that some people feel toward the film is somewhat understandable, as it functions like a part two and does not, therefore, close or develop *all* if it’s characters and narrative strands to the fullest extent. But the superlatively negative lashing that the film has received is so obviously burdened with pre-determined hatred and Potter-haters just willing failure on the series that I can’t remotely entertain the constant aggressive proselytizing about how “THE FILM SUCKS, AND YOU SHOULD THINK IT DOES TOO”.   Look, there’s ALWAYS objectivity in entertainment and in film criticism in particular, but when you reach such extremes and preach such hyperbole about a film being “the worst film of a series/the month/the year”, (or, alternately, the “best film ever”), you need to provide valid arguments and justification to back that statement up, and simply no one has when it comes to Crimes of Grindelwald.   There are SOME things worth criticizing, such as the fast-and-loose editing and the insufficient running time, and, again, I understand some people’s frustration with how incomplete some of it feels due to the serialized nature of this 5-part story, but these are *little* criticisms at best, and constant, rote, cliché accusations and imputations of “plot holes!” and “bad writing!”, or insistences that the series is just rotten to the core and needs to simplify itself/“change the entire overarching narrative” for you to like it are such lame, low-effort, highly-personal, ignorant criticisms, and they just do not cut it, and provide no solid base on which to place such grandiose accusations of the film franchise being “trash”, or even just “poorly made”.   This, on top of the outrageous amount of unwarranted controversy and abuse Rowling got before the film came out, as well as the snide, dismissive treatment the film got for absolute no reason at all from members of the entertainment media (mocking the title of the film, getting mad that the film ended up on “most anticipated movies of the fall season” polls, or insisting that it would fail at the box office) sort of drives home that the bulk of the criticism around the film, and the negative hyperbole, just isn’t warranted at all.   It looks like a bunch of non-fans and haters jumping at the chance/formulating excuses to trash a successful franchise.   And when all else fails, this franchise is already a billion dollars rich. CoG improved upon the overseas performance of the original. The original film was positively reviewed. The audience response, while more lukewarm than usual, was decent as indicated by IMDb, Google, RT, CinemaScore, and Metacritic, and the franchise has already earned itself an Oscar and a BAFTA. CoG was nominated for a BAFTA and numerous guild awards. The fact that people are jumping at the bit to classify the franchise a failure on top of all this just demonstrates that the “criticism” is irrational and forced."

This tends to bother me a lot in situations of house pride. For example, when choosing special book editions or merchandising.   I've taken the pottermore test and lot of surveys and quizzes that specifies the percentage of ""house"" you get. Every time Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff get really close percentages, with Ravenclaw always at the front.  I really identify with both. I'm very study and knowledge oriented, I love having good grades and do my best at work or school at all times. One of the reasons I chose a path in medicine is so that I can be constantly learning, but (apart from  being able to detach myself emotionally) personality wise I'm a Hufflepuff.  I'm told I'm very nice (and people do try to take an advantage at that), approachable, I love to help and I find goodness in almost everyone.  Note: I do know that belonging to a house does not mean I need to check all of the boxes as I said it only bothers me in house pride situations in regular situations I comfortably say that I'm an Ravenpuff."

So Grindelwald wants Credence to kill Dumbledore... but like.. how?  Magically speaking, we know Credence is nowhere powerful enough to kill Albus Dumbledore. Credence, in his genuine rage, couldn't even hurt that beast hunter who killed the half-elf nurse.  If Grindelwald was going for an emotional trauma/guilt-about-Ariana angle, that doesn't work either because, according to the interview of Yates, Dumbledore has no idea who Aurelius Dumbledore is.  So what on earth was Grindelwald planning to do? Show up at Hogwarts with Credence, do a 5-min powerpoint presentation about how Credence is indeed related to Dumbledore before ordering Credence to fight? Except...that would totally blow off his lie to Credence about Credence's brother wanting to destroy him.  No matter how I look at it, I don't see how Grindelwald imagines Credence will be able to kill Dumbledore."

I'm reading the books for the first time (I'm in OOTP, rn) and those days I've learned about a cutted scene in Deathly Hallows of Aunt Petunia talking about Lily, and how fans hate that scene.  I mean. Why?  Ok, I know, it's not book canonic at all, I get this. But I think that **that** would be an amazing scene, where we would *finally* see Aunt Petunia's human side.  I like to think that Petunia just envied her sister's power, and seeing her sister getting to be a witch and she not, made she rise a hate big enough to treat Harry how she did. But in that scene, she leaving behind her hate above the Wizarding World, and talking to Harry about her sister is **really** deep, and would change how we see Petunia, just like Dudley's image changed after his farewell to his cousin.   The thing is, Petunia may not be as bad as she looks like, and that scene may prove it if it was written by Rowling, back in 2006/7. And I think it's a great scene, that she deserved.  I mean, Harry Potter is all about ""Always"", even tho Snape is a hopeless jerk all the time."

2419,every time i start reading them again https //imgur com/gallery/l9puhr5 i have read the harry potter series upwards of   times make no mistake i enjoy the ride every time i do something about not only this story but the magic in rowling s writing gets me captivated every time but at this point i can t help but feel that every time i go to start again as i m reading through the first few books it s like fuck i d love to fast forward to goblet of fire here it s not that i don t love everything about all of the books but i do find that as a knowledgeable avid reading who knows nearly everything about the series the first two and arguably three books can sometimes be painful to read not because the story or the plot is subpar but because the initial three books were written as you could argue they should be to really focus on introducing the reader to this world so every encounter not just the first chapters but late in the book as each area of hogwarts is discovered is written from the perspective that the reader knows nothing about it for book one absolutely valid books  and  unfortunately also do this for some reason assuming that someone would either start the series out of order or that a returning reader needs a refresher i find it a bit of a grind getting through these particularly the first two but for some reason i don t have it in me to actually skip ahead i feel like my reading won t be authentic if i don t read every book so i force myself to get through them and not skip again it s not that i don t enjoy the stories in these first few books but find that as an experienced and knowledgeable reader and fan they are more difficult from this perspective anyone else feel this way do you also have a mental problem with skipping ahead to maintain

... https://imgur.com/gallery/L9PUhR5  I have read the Harry Potter series upwards of 50-60 times. Make no mistake - I enjoy the ride every time I do. Something about not only this story but the magic in Rowling’s writing gets me captivated every time.  BUT...  At this point, I can’t help but feel that every time I go to start again, as I’m reading through the first few books, it’s like fuck I’d love to fast forward to Goblet of Fire here. It’s not that I don’t love everything about all of the books. But I do find that as a knowledgeable, avid reading who knows (nearly) everything about the series, the first two and arguably three books can sometimes be painful to read. Not because the story or the plot is subpar. But because the initial three books were written, as you could argue they should be, to really focus on introducing the reader to this world. So every encounter - not just the first chapters, but late in the book as each area of Hogwarts is discovered - is written from the perspective that the reader knows nothing about it. For book one - absolutely valid. Books 2 and 3 unfortunately also do this, for some reason assuming that someone would either start the series out of order or that a returning reader needs a refresher. I find it a bit of a grind getting through these, particularly the first two.  But for some reason, I don’t have it in me to actually skip ahead. I feel like my reading won’t be authentic if I don’t read every book, so I force myself to get through them and not skip. Again, it’s not that I don’t enjoy the stories in these first few books, but find that as an experienced and knowledgeable reader and fan they are more difficult from this perspective.  Anyone else feel this way? Do you also have a mental problem with skipping ahead to maintain authenticity? Lol  Cheers"

So a huge part of the whole story is how Lily died to save Harry, and through this act of sacrifice her protection ran in his blood and made the killing curse rebound on Voldemort. In the 7th book, Harry sacrifices himself for everyone else and when he ""comes back"" from the dead and the fighting recommences, HIS protection keeps everyone else safe, prevents curses from binding, etc.   So what I don't get is... if sacrificing yourself for a loved one is what it takes to prevent Avada Kedavra from killing them, why is Harry the first one to ever have survived it? You would think the situation would have arisen countless times before Harry existed, that a mother sacrificed herself to the Killing curse for her child, likely even to Voldemort. I did consider that maybe Voldemort's soul was so unstable by that point that it affected the curse, but I dunno, seems like it would have still happened before Harry. Thoughts/theories?"

How *cliche* would Harmione love story be? The main characters, smartest ones, have so much in common...   If they actually did happen- it would be *boring*. Expected, cliche and just nothing special. In other hand, Romione is opposite then that. Romione is unique, imperfect, and beautiful. Just like real life relationship. (Yeah,sorry to spoil it but Jim and Pam don\`t exist T\_T)  And the fact that JKR actually said she sould make them happen is dissapointing. During the whole series ""chemistry"" between two of them *never happend.* Honestly they had it as must as Harry and Ron for example. All they were was friends, best friends. And that only.   P.S. to all Harmione shippers here, i am sorry if i annoyed you. And i am not going to say it\`s just my opinion- i only said facts. And you have the right to ship whoever you wan\`t."

I really think that for those who were disappointed or just in feeling purgatory, see it twice. I really think it may make you feel better and even possibly like it more."

He almost seemed like A conductor.   So our theory is that the reason Voldemort and Grindelwald swings their wand almost like they dont even Care, is because they Are so superior to their opponent that they wont even give Them their full attention. The Only time We See Voldemort and Dumbledore fight, Both of Them Seem more tense than usual and We bet Grindelwald Will be more tense and pay more attention to the fight"

2988,my suggestions on how to make fb3 and future movies an enjoyable experience for all with the recent news that the third fantastic beats wont be released until  i've been thinking about how they could possible improve upon this series and they have to if they want this thing to stay alive here are a few suggestions i came up with that i personally think could yield good results  make a linear focused and clear story line lets face it the second movie had quite a lot going on too much for the majority of viewers the next few movies each need to have a clear objective and point leave minimal to zero room for the audience to potential get confused by whats happening on screen  trim the fat an extension of my first suggestion some of these characters will have to be put aside jacob nagini theseus and tina should not play key roles at least in the next movie i like jacob but his comedy relief schick is starting to wane a lot of movies sometimes fall into the trap of giving a side character more time than needed sometimes less is more  liven up the lore while i am intrigued by the dumbledore vs grindelwald storyline and what it adds/can add the overall potter lore i feel that it's not being presented in an enticing enough way that can keep the general audience wanting to learn more i also feel like there is an overreliance on having to tie everything back into the harry potter story my main example of this is credence potentially being a dumbledore it seems too contrived for my taste i think these movies would be served better if they didn't lean so heavily into lore we already know create/expand new lore explore the world and have stand alone adventure stories that can work on their own and but also loosely tie into the greater plot thats happening in the

experience for all With the recent news that the third Fantastic Beats wont be released until 2021 I've been thinking about how they could possible improve upon this series, and they have to if they want this thing to stay alive. Here are a few suggestions I came up with that I personally think could yield good results.  1) Make a Linear, focused, and clear story line: Lets face it, the second movie had quite a lot going on, too much for the majority of viewers. The next few movies each need to have a clear objective and point; leave minimal to zero room for the audience to potential get confused by whats happening on screen.  2) Trim the fat: An extension of my first suggestion, some of these characters will have to be put aside. Jacob, Nagini, Theseus, and Tina should not play key roles at least in the next movie. I like Jacob but his comedy relief Schick is starting to wane, a lot of movies sometimes fall into the trap of giving a side character more time than needed. Sometimes less is more.  3) Liven up the lore: While I am intrigued by the Dumbledore vs Grindelwald storyline and what it adds/can add the overall potter lore I feel that it's not being presented in an enticing enough way that can keep the general audience wanting to learn more. I also feel like there is an overreliance on having to tie everything back into the harry potter story, my main example of this is Credence potentially being a Dumbledore, it seems too contrived for my taste.

4001,skender theory in a scene cut out from the end of the first fb movie the ringmaster of circus arcanus already had an appearence he met with credence after he recovered from the attack by the macusa and offered him a job at circus arcanus when he hesitated skender pointed out that his life was at stake in america which led him to agree and join the circus headed to europe on the same boat as newt skender is said to be a rather ambigious character yet what does that mean for the next movie ____________________________________ credence' new life so far credence seems healthy and has appearently made a friend in maledictus yet it kinda points out to me that on the moving picture in the trailer he is the only one not moving what happened to him i believe he has him training him along with the other artists his job being lifting them up into the air in obscurus form invisible and smashing through solid materials as part of the show to keep his powers under control skender either arranged a wand for him to practise to lower his magic to a safe level yet strong enough for his performance has him training his performance on a regular basis once he is exhausted and tired he lets him rest until his power is high enough again to go into obscurus form which means he constantly goes back and forth between exhaustion and his magic rising to an uncomfortable level has him training regularily but never to exhaustion this way credence learns to go back and forth in his forms without bursting out and using his power safely since credence is an important part of the show skender treats him friendlily gaining his trust the second option is the more dramatic one where credence would want to escape the circus and dream of a better life but can t since he s got nowhere to go still fears the macusa and most of all can t leave the slowly transforming maledictus behind yet the third one is more likely a story where credence is betrayed once more by someone he thought was going to help him would make sense yet does skender as i mentioned credence on the picture is not moving at all along with his stern expression this could mean that has learned to control his obscurus and can use it at will now safely i think you alrealdy sense a bigger plan behind this ______________________________________________________ a deal with grindelwald it is possible that skender is a follower of grindelwald who since this man has his ways got the order to train credence it would make sense especially if grindelwald hears that he is taking care of the boy and after his breakout he may visit the circus to examine the result of skender s training and to recruit credence yet will skender give him up just like that i mentioned that credence has been betrayed before but what if we get a different story this time what if skender originally agreed to eventually hand him over and abused the fact that he had nowhere to go but over time found a liking in him he may hand him over as planned but start to question his decision maybe even go against grindelwald in the boy s defence along with the rest of the circus staff or pushed by them this would not only make a contrast to

He met with Credence after he recovered from the attack by the MACUSA and offered him a job at Circus Arcanus. When he hesitated, Skender pointed out that his life was at stake in America, which led him to agree and join the circus headed to europe (on the same boat as Newt).  Skender is said to be a rather **ambigious** character… yet what does that mean for the next movie?  ____________________________________  **Credence' new life**  So far, Credence seems healthy and has appearently made a friend in Maledictus … yet it kinda points out to me that on the moving picture in the trailer, **he is the only one not moving.**  What happened to him?  I believe he has him training him along with the other artists, his job being **lifting them up into the air** in Obscurus form (invisible) and **smashing through solid materials** as part of the show.  To keep his powers under control, Skender either   * arranged a wand for him to practise, to lower his magic to a safe level, yet strong enough for his performance  * has him training his performance on a regular basis - once he is exhausted and tired, he lets him rest until his power is high enough again to go into Obscurus form - which means he constantly goes back and forth between exhaustion and his magic rising to an uncomfortable level…  * has him training regularily, but never to exhaustion - this way Credence learns to go back and forth in his forms without bursting out and using his power safely. Since Credence is an important part of the show, SKender treats him friendlily, gaining his trust    The second option is the more dramatic, one where Credence would want to escape the circus and dream of a better life… but can’t since he’s got nowhere to go, still fears the MACUSA and most of all, can’t leave the slowly transforming Maledictus behind.  Yet the third one is more likely… a story where Credence is betrayed once more by someone he thought was going to help him would make sense… yet does Skender?  As I mentioned, Credence on the picture is not moving at all… along with his stern expression, this could mean that has learned to control his Obscurus and can use it at will now safely.

Now I talked a bit about this on why Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite movie but i wanted to talk a little bit more on this.     Lycanthropy is a disease. And Rowling treats it like that. So many forms of media that feature vampires or werewolves show werewolves as like these creatures that sometimes have to go away when there's a full moon. Sure it's painful but it doesn't impact their lives in any other way aside from the fact that, whenever there's a full moon they gotta go. But in Harry Potter you can see Lupin getting weaker and more agitated. In the movie he's limping and struggling. Even having to take time off of class because of how bad he feels. It's not just some inconvenience, it is a disease.  & #   I love that. It's such a good way of not only enhancing our world view but also shedding light on something that most people would think to be pretty great. At least i did. ""Once in awhile i transform into this super powerful creature of the night? Sign my ass up!"" But it's so much more then that. It's painful and irritating. You can see it and experience it. After watching Harry Potter i didn't wanna be a werewolf anymore. It just looks like suffering and it's supposed to.      Now I'm not gonna sit here and claim the Rowling is the first to do it, since I don't know. But I will comfortably say that her depiction of Lycanthropy is one of my favorites."

3062,the goldmine café speculation my favorite headcannon for jacob and queenie s future upon returning from rio they open up an underground cafe for wizards in london let s simply for now call it the goldmine above it s still just a small bakery that also sells strange looking dough creatures but once in a while a customer pointendly asks jacob where he has learned all of this in  his response is paris it varies over the years of course this word grants the asking wizards entrance through a small door in the sidestreet next to the bakery and a wink from the little golden angel on it the stairs behind it lead to a cellar cafe where they are greeted by queenie and countless other wizards enjoying their lunch or coffee or tea of course and cake the goldmine not only becomes to place to grow up in for a few certain children but also a meeting spot for the leaque of extrodinariy ladies and gentlemen who can be seen on framed photos on the wall next to pictures from city and landcapes the us england france brazil and china etc and drawings of magical creatures i feel like this idea is even something that you could read out of the scene of jacob and queenie s first meeting they found that they both love to cook and bake and to make people happy through this jacob s words even when he talks to newt a little later and as aforementioned it would provide the group with a proper meeting spot for the fourth and fifth movie and the years between a little like the room of requirement for the da it would in any way be the perfect future for these two and a great way to try and settle a

In my own beliefs, it’s   1) Kreacher, which is an exceptional example of a B character with his own perfect little arc that not only stays true to the themes of the story throughout, but is also entertaining to read. Also his ending, literally leading the house elves in the battle of hogwarts, is truly satisfying.  2) Horace Slughorn. As much as I love the earlier books in their own way, it does occasionally fall back on some pretty blunt “good vs evil” characterization, and it was refreshing and interesting to see a character that wasn’t truly good, but most certainly wasn’t evil. He had a distinct personality that whether you liked him or hated him was still engrossing, and was very much something we hadn’t seen before in the series.  Quite curious to see what everyone else thinks deserves more credit.  (Oh almost forgot Fleur; I think she’s a far more interesting character then people give her credit for)"

2081,in deathly hallows why didn't the trio just go accio salmon at the river in deathly hallows chapter  the goblin's revenge ron hermoine are arguing over the food because the fish that hermoine

In Deathly Hallows, Chapter 15 (The Goblin's Revenge), Ron &  Hermoine are arguing over the food because the fish that Hermoine caught were disgusting.  They then overhear another group of outlaws, one of which was Tonks' dad, Ted Tonks. Harry hears Ted say ""accio salmon"" and then hears the sound of dozens of salmon jumping out of the river and next to Ted &  Co.  So ... why the fuck didn't just do that to get some edible food? I mean ... it's one thing if the readers can themselves think of an instant, easy solution to the characters' problems (e.g. why didn't the Fellowship just have the eagles fly the ring over to Mordor in a few hours?). It's another thing entirely for the *author herself* to actually demonstrate a quick and easy solution to a problem, and then the heroes just never use it.  It's not even like that time in Order of the Phoenix where Cho asked Harry on a date at the upcoming Hogsmeade visit, only for Harry to not realize until a moment later what was actually happening.

Oh no, I haven’t checked the notice board since I got back. . . .” “Yes, it’s on Valentine’s Day. . . .” “Right,” said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this. “Well, I suppose you want to — ?” “Only if you do,” she said eagerly. Harry stared. He had been about to say “I suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meeting is?” but her response did not seem to fit. “I — er —” he said. “Oh, it’s okay if you don’t,” she said, looking mortified. “Don’t worry. I-I’ll see you around.” She walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working frantically. Then something clunked into place. “Cho! Hey — CHO!” He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase. “Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine’s Day?” “Oooh, yes!” she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him.!&lt;  Rather, in this scene in Deathly Hallows, it just appears as though *Rowling herself* completely failed to connect the dots, not any of the characters in her story!"

489,a defence of harry did yah put your name in the goblet of fiyaaaah many harry potter fans think that michael gambon's reading of the line harry did you put your name of the goblet of fire is the worst thing in the harry potter movies it isn't by the way that would be the rock band at the yule ball but that's an argument for another day if they don't think that they consider it very out of character for dumbledore to be shouting at harry like that especially when in the book he's described to have asked that question calmly or they make jokes about it because it's a so bad it's good line reading however i've done some thinking and i've come to a conclusion that it actually is fitting for dumbledore to be mad at harry for possibly submitting his name for the triwizard tournament even though dumbledore isn't angry in the book prefatory note while i usually consider book canon to be above movie canon this is trying to rationalise something that only exists in the movie so i will consider the separate canons equal for this many people my mom among them question why harry has to compete in the triwizard tournament at all cedric's older and more experienced and harry definitely doesn't want to compete in the tournament at all so it would be better for all involved if the people in charge let harry not compete the book and the movie say the goblet of fire constitutes a 'binding magical contract' and that's all they really do to explain that basically harry has to compete because the goblet says so however do we know of any specific binding magical contracts yes yes we do the unbreakable vow introduced in half blood prince where if you break the vow you die yes the goblet and the unbreakable vow are never explicitly linked in the books or movies so this is in the realm of speculation but fan theory videos have floated the idea of a connection between those two things before it's not explicit what the conditions of an unbreakable vow with the goblet of fire would be other than 'compete in the tasks' and there are a few problems with that like champions potentially not figuring out the egg's riddle and then potentially not competing in the second task because of that or that fleur delacour had to bow out early in both the second and third tasks however those problems don't really harm this theory that much what matters is if harry doesn't compete in the tournament he dies of course the triwizard tournament is notoriously dangerous and many past champions die anyway this means if harry does compete in the tasks he very easily could die but if he doesn't he certainly will die got all that now harry dying in the triwizard tournament would be an enormous problem for the wizarding world as he would die but the horcrux in his body would still be alive with no way to kill it if harry is buried if harry dies voldemort would live on with one of his horcruxes still intact even if someone destroyed all the others voldemort also hasn't taken harry's blood with lily's protection in it yet so harry doesn't have a lifeline if he dies like he will have when voldemort kills him at the end of deathly hallows if harry died in the triwizard tournament it would be at the wrong time to have any effect on voldemort's horcrux inside harry so if harry had voluntarily put his name into the goblet of fire he would have put himself at a high risk of dying without the horcrux being destroyed if he competes it's a high risk of dying if he doesn't compete he's sure to die without the horcrux being destroyed if harry had voluntarily entered himself into the tournament he would have put the fate of the entire wizarding world on the line just for glory in the triwizard tournament now if you're dumbledore you know that harry eventually has to die at the hands of voldemort so that voldemort can only be defeated and there's no other way to defeat voldemort and harry has just put himself in a situation where he might die if he did compete but would definitely die if he didn't compete you'd be pretty angry with him too now of course harry didn't enter his name into the goblet but if he had dumbledore would have the right to be angry at him now was michael gambon thinking about all of this in his performance of course not they filmed the goblet of fire movie before the half blood prince book was released so the unbreakable vow wouldn't have been introduced yet in real time and the deathly hallows book where harry being a horcrux is revealed was released still two years later than that even if they had gambon probably wouldn't have thought about those things because this theory is a really deep cut and it relies on speculation in a few places regardless if you think about all of this dumbledore's anger at harry for possibly putting his name into the goblet of fire is not actually as out of place as the memes might have you believe feel free to critique this theory and let me know what you thought or if i got anything wrong or if the leaps in logic i made don't actually make sense if anyone reading makes harry potter theory videos go ahead and use this if you want to alright that's all i've got,a

Defence of ""HARRY DID YAH PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIYAAAAH?"" Many Harry Potter fans think that Michael Gambon's reading of the line ""Harry, did you put your name of the Goblet of Fire?"" is the worst thing in the Harry Potter movies. (It isn't, by the way. That would be the rock band at the Yule Ball, but that's an argument for another day.) If they don't think that, they consider it very out of character for Dumbledore to be shouting at Harry like that, especially when, in the book, he's described to have asked that question calmly; or they make jokes about it because it's a ""so-bad-it's-good"" line reading. However, I've done some thinking and I've come to a conclusion that it actually is fitting for Dumbledore to be mad at Harry for possibly submitting his name for the TriWizard Tournament, even though Dumbledore isn't angry in the book.   & #   Prefatory Note: While I usually consider book canon to be above movie canon, this is trying to rationalise something that only exists in the movie, so I will consider the separate canons equal for this.   & #   Many people, my mom among them, question why Harry has to compete in the TriWizard Tournament at all. Cedric's older and more experienced and Harry definitely doesn't want to compete in the Tournament at all so it would be better for all involved if the people in charge let Harry not compete. The book and the movie say the Goblet of Fire constitutes a 'binding magical contract' and that's all they really do to explain that. Basically, Harry has to compete because the Goblet says so. However, do we know of any specific binding magical contracts? Yes, yes we do: The Unbreakable Vow, introduced in *Half-Blood Prince*, where if you break the vow, you die. Yes, the Goblet and the Unbreakable Vow are never explicitly linked in the books or movies, so this is in the realm of speculation, but fan theory videos have floated the idea of a connection between those two things before. It's not explicit what the conditions of an Unbreakable Vow with the Goblet of Fire would be other than 'compete in the tasks' and there are a few problems with that, like champions potentially not figuring out the Egg's Riddle and then potentially not competing in the Second Task because of that, or that Fleur Delacour had to bow out early in both the Second and Third Tasks. However, those problems don't really harm this theory that much. What matters is if Harry doesn't compete in the tournament, he dies. Of course, the TriWizard Tournament is notoriously dangerous and many past champions die anyway. This means, if Harry does compete in the tasks, he very easily could die, but if he doesn't, he certainly will die. Got all that?  & #   Now, Harry dying in the TriWizard Tournament would be an enormous problem for the Wizarding World as he would die, but the Horcrux in his body would still be alive with no way to kill it if Harry is buried. If Harry dies, Voldemort would live on with one of his Horcruxes still intact even if someone destroyed all the others. Voldemort also hasn't taken Harry's blood with Lily's protection in it yet, so Harry doesn't have a lifeline if he dies like he will have when Voldemort kills him at the end of *Deathly Hallows.* If Harry died in the TriWizard Tournament, it would be at the wrong time to have any effect on Voldemort's Horcrux inside Harry. So, if Harry had voluntarily put his name into the Goblet of Fire, he would have put himself at a high risk of dying without the Horcrux being destroyed. If he competes, it's a high risk of dying. If he doesn't compete, he's sure to die without the Horcrux being destroyed. If Harry had voluntarily entered himself into the Tournament, he would have put the fate of the entire Wizarding World on the line just for glory in the TriWizard Tournament. Now, if you're Dumbledore, you know that Harry eventually has to die at the hands of Voldemort so that Voldemort can only be defeated, and there's no other way to defeat Voldemort, and Harry has just put himself in a situation where he might die if he did compete but would definitely die if he didn't compete, you'd be pretty angry with him, too. Now, of course, Harry didn't enter his name into the Goblet, but if he had, Dumbledore would have the right to be angry at him.   & #   Now, was Michael Gambon thinking about all of this in his performance? Of course not. They filmed the *Goblet of Fire* movie before the *Half-Blood Prince* book was released, so the Unbreakable Vow wouldn't have been introduced yet in real time, and the *Deathly Hallows* book, where Harry being a horcrux is revealed, was released still two years later than that. Even if they had, Gambon probably wouldn't have thought about those things, because this theory is a really deep cut and it relies on speculation in a few places. Regardless, if you think about all of this, Dumbledore's anger at Harry for possibly putting his name into the Goblet of Fire is not actually as out of place as the memes might have you believe.   & #   Feel free to critique this theory and let me know what you thought or if I got anything wrong or if the leaps in logic I made don't actually make sense. If anyone reading makes Harry Potter theory videos, go ahead and use this if you want to. Alright, that's all I've got."

Her description addresses the markings, clarifying they’re replaced by her glasses. !&lt;  &gt;&gt;!“...he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.”!&lt;  &gt;!It can be deduced without question that if one was to know McGonagall’s Animagus form, she’d be easily identifiable. My question is, is this the case for every Animagi form? From my knowledge of past readings, we’re made aware of several other witches and wizards who are able to take animal forms, but as far as I can remember, the only other one we’re given a more exact description of is of Rita Skeeter’s, and I believe she had distinctive markings too. !&lt;  &gt;!Another question of mine to do with the markings around McGonagall’s eyes to represent her glasses is to they have significance? If she is in need of glasses to see, does her vision improve as a cat? Or does it stay the same, and, instead of it looking silly that a cat is wearing glasses, do the markings just disguise them and provide the same visual aid that she needs? !&lt;  &gt;&gt;!“A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching...and its eyes narrowed.”!&lt;  &gt;!Does the narrowed eyes mean she’s focusing to see if this is who she’s been waiting for? Or do they narrow to demonstrate her focusing? !&lt;  &gt;!This is just one of the questions I’ve developed so far, but to keep from overloading both myself and anyone reading, I’ll stop here. I’ve posted this on my Tumblr as well. !&lt;"

3228,i just watched cog i finally made myself time to watch cog i loved it loved seeing newt again loved the new creatures loved seeing the different ministry of magic around the world loved seeing new tricks loved dumbledore and loved grindelwald that being said i don't think the movie is perfect the story did seem a little all over the place not because of the content but because the events from scene to scene felt rushed instead if natural decisions made by the characters again it doesn't mean i didn't like said events i disliked the transitions between them sometimes it felt like the subplots overlapped without real connection it made me wish jk would write the books and let someone else write the scripts that and the music would be my only big complains i wish they would've made a more iconical soundtrack it felt generic surprisingly though two of the most solid parts of the movie were every dumbledore and grindelwald's scenes before watching cog i was a bit worried because  all the criticism johnny depp has had lately  i wasn't sure jude law could portray dumbledore for multiple reasons at the end their scenes were the ones that immersed me in the story the most since i tried to stay away from spoilers the blood vow took me by surprise that was a great little twist it was a bit un epic how newt got the thing why would grindelwald have the vial in such an easy place for someone to steal i also loved pretty much every scene with newt in it interestingly enough he wasn't really the hero of the movie nor the main protagonist by the end of it that disappointed me a little i was expecting a great character development for him but in general he only confessed to and chose a side quite forcefully finally what got my attention was the credence subplot he's more powerful than i imagined but i still can't see a real threat from him he doesn't feel convinced enough yet same as i don't really see newt convinced enough to be a hero for any violent cause yet i still think he would look for another way to fight other than violence but you know epic magic movie there has to be a big fight between heroes and villains at some point i will have to let it sink a few more hours and then look into the details i'm sure i missed in other words theory time,i just watch cog i final made myself time to watch cog i love it love see newt again love the new creatur love see the differ ministri of magic around the world love see new trick love dumbledor and love grindelwald that be said i don't think the movi is perfect the stori did seem a littl all over the place not becaus of the content but becaus the event from scene to scene felt rush instead if natur decis made by the charact again it doesn't mean i didn't like said event i dislik the transit between them sometim it felt like the subplot overlap without real connect it made me wish jk would write the book and let someon els write the script that and the music would be my onli big complain i wish they would'v made a more icon soundtrack it felt gener surprisingli though two of the most solid part of the movi were everi dumbledor and grindelwald' scene befor watch cog i wa a bit worri becaus  all the critic johnni depp ha had late  i wasn't sure jude law could portray dumbledor for multipl reason at the end their scene were the one that immers me in the stori the most sinc i tri to

threat from him he doesn't feel convinc enough yet same as i don't realli see newt convinc enough to be a hero for ani violent caus yet i still think he would look for anoth way to fight other than violenc but you know epic magic movi there ha to be a big fight between hero and villain at some point i will have to let it sink a few more hour and then look into the detail i'm sure i miss in other

villain at some point i will have to let it sink a few more hour and then look into the detail i'm sure i miss in other word theori time,"I just watched CoG I finally made myself time to watch CoG! I loved it! Loved seeing Newt again, loved the new creatures, loved seeing the different Ministry of Magic around the world, loved seeing new tricks, loved Dumbledore and loved Grindelwald.  That being said, I don't think the movie is perfect. The story *did* seem a little all over the place, not because of the content but because the events from scene to scene felt rushed instead if natural decisions made by the characters. Again, it doesn't mean I didn't like said events, I disliked the transitions between them. Sometimes it felt like the subplots overlapped without real connection. It made me wish JK would write the books and let someone else write the scripts.  That, and the music, would be my only big complains. I wish they would've made a more iconical soundtrack... It felt generic.  Surprisingly though, two of the most solid parts of the movie were every Dumbledore and Grindelwald's scenes. Before watching CoG I was a bit worried because 1) all the criticism Johnny Depp has had lately, 2) I wasn't sure Jude Law could portray Dumbledore for multiple reasons. **At the end**, their scenes were the ones that immersed me in the story the most.   Since I tried to stay away from spoilers, the blood vow took me by surprise. That was a great little twist. It was a bit ""un-epic"" how Newt got the thing. Why would Grindelwald have the vial in such an easy place for someone to steal?  I also *loved* pretty much every scene with Newt in it. Interestingly enough, he wasn't really the hero of the movie nor the main protagonist by the end of it. That disappointed me a little, I was expecting a great character development for him but, in general, he only confessed to and *""chose a side""* quite forcefully.  Finally, what got my attention was the Credence subplot. He's more powerful than I imagined but I still can't see a real threat from him. He doesn't feel convinced enough yet. Same as I don't really see Newt convinced enough to be a hero for any violent cause yet. I still think he would look for another way to fight other than violence. But... you know... Epic magic movie, there has to be a big fight between heroes and villains at some point.  I will have to let it sink a few more hours and then look into the details I'm sure I missed. In other words... *theory time*!"

In the latest trailer, Grindelwald says ""There arrogance is a key to our victory"".  I think he is talking about muggles when he says 'there'.  As Seamus says in his theory, Grindelwald will stop attacking the Wizarding world and start disturbing the Muggle world instead.  Maybe he is controlling The German chancellor of 1933 (not going to type his name here though).  In the part 'History' of this [fandom](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Inferius) page says that Grindelwald wanted an inferius army and in the years 1939 - 1945 we know a lot of people were killed at the fronts and in the camps  I think it is possible that Grindelwald used these bodies to build his army.  This was very dark thank you for reading and comment any thoughts"

Jacob will die at the hands of Grindelwald, as apart of his anti-muggle movement, thus making Newt’s motivation to help defeat him even greater, or  2. Somehow, Muggles in this series will be able to participate in the Magical world, as in: maybe Jacob will still have a career in working with magical creatures.

1838,casting a patronus is beyond owl not because it s complex but because it requires an understanding of what true happiness is to be successful and the average young adult doesn t figure out true happiness at  some do like harry but obviously he struggles finding a happy memory when he s first learning the charm first time flying is more elation than happiness finding out he wouldn t have to live with the dursleys is relieving but thinking about his best friends in a time of crisis and knowing how important they are to you that s happiness which doesn t happen till he s fifteen if i m not mistaken and the average young adult would struggle to see those differences or at least i wouldn t have until i was much older than  or even  when harry really masters the patronus idk what do yall think,cast a patronu is beyond owl not becaus it s complex but becaus it requir an understand of what true happi is to be success and the averag young adult doesn t figur out true happi at  some do like harri but obvious he struggl find a happi memori when he s first learn the charm first time fli is more elat than happi find out he wouldn t have to live with the dursley is reliev but think about hi best friend in a time of crisi and know how import they are to you that s happi which doesn t happen till he s fifteen if i m not mistaken and the averag young adult would struggl to see those differ or at least i wouldn t have until i wa much older than  or even  when harri realli master the patronu idk what do yall think,cast a patronu is beyond owl not becaus it s complex but becaus it requir an understand of what true happi is to be success and the averag young adult doesn t figur out true happi at  some do like harri but obvious he struggl find a happi memori when he s first learn the charm first time fli is more elat than happi find out he wouldn t have to live with the dursley is reliev but think about hi best friend in a time of crisi and know how import they are to you that s happi which doesn t happen till he s fifteen if i m not mistaken and the averag young adult would struggl to see those differ or at least i wouldn t have until i wa much older than  or even  when harri realli master the patronu idk what do yall think,"Casting a patronus is beyond OWL not because it’s complex, but because it requires an understanding of what true happiness is to be successful and the average young adult doesn’t figure out true happiness at 15. Some do, like harry. But obviously he struggles finding a happy memory when he’s first learning the charm. First time flying is more elation than happiness. Finding out he wouldn’t have to live with the dursleys is relieving. But thinking about his best friends in a time of crisis and knowing how important they are to you, that’s happiness which doesn’t happen till he’s fifteen if i’m not mistaken.  And the average young adult would struggle to see those differences, or at least I wouldn’t have until i was much older than 13 or even 15 when harry really masters the patronus.  Idk. What do yall think?"
1121,i've got an idea for a harry potter video game with portkey games advertising wizards unite on youtube i was thinking idly one day about what kind of game would work most efficiently in the harry potter universe and i came up with this i'd appreciate feedback on what you guys all think of it seeing as you more than likely know your stuff when it comes to this your character is a muggle who basically stumbled into the plot by accident as a terrorist cell of dark wizards has emerged and things are going wrong all over the place you are either immune to memory charms or manage to avoid being hit by one and you end up finding a way to infiltrate the ministry of magic to get answers to everything or find at least somebody accountable noticing how skilled you are at infiltrating harry notes that your life has already been ruined even before you got into the ministry and he also takes note of your talent for infiltrating places you are then asked to help stop the terrorists and find out what's going on with the help of ron having george weasley and hermione granger help him in putting together specialized gadgets making wizarding wheezes into what is in essence a covertly outsourced q branch that gives the player magically enchanted gadgets and artefacts to assist in game should you be captured or killed the memories of people who know you well will be modified and the ministry will deny your very existence the story could have elements of the mysteries that the novels have going on in spades thanks to its linear level by level setup but the levels are still large sprawling castles and secret bases non linear in nature with the player given a list of objectives a large level and away you go maybe you'll knock somebody out and break their wand to stop them being a threat or maybe you'll steal all kinds of stuff from them that incriminates them and ask hermione to get rita skeeter to publish an article ruining their reputation forever or maybe you'll just steal all their stuff and bankrupt them i don't know maybe you'll get past some hostiles by using a deluminator to knock out some light sources maybe you'll use a gadget or artefact that allows you to turn invisible and you'll cautiously weave through the guards before the effect wears off or maybe you'll just chuck a golden snitch at them from where they can't see you and slip away undetected because the guards are too busy falling over themselves trying to catch the annoying thing to notice some schmuck sneaking about or maybe you'll just pull out an enchanted club and pick them off one by one knocking them all out not killing them of course j k doesn't like that sort of thing so let's not put it in the game it's not the point after all your enemies however may not think the same way you may think that having a melee weapon to bludgeon enemies into unconsciousness is empowering but up against  guards with the body bind curse or even the killing curse yeah you're going to want to remain stealthy this would provide a large amount of tension with the payoff being the somewhat amusing and deliciously awesome fact that you just won against a bunch of wizards as a mere muggle with

see anyone downvote him please we where sharing thoughts lets respect everyone's speach plz and proposed the idea that maybe the women and snake nagini and two seperate enteties like when ginny is possested by the memory of tom in cos or maybe she can remember like if she were a spectator like us in a movie theater we can't interact with the movie we can only sit and watch and sees everything snake nagini does but can't interact with her so bassicaly women nagini would be a nice person fearing her condition and fearing that she will lose her humanity in a tweet couldn't find it i swear this acting controversy has made it so much harder to find claudia kim or jk rowling say that nagini will be fighting for her humanity not wanting to turn into the beasts we know she will become and then i wondered what if maledictus' turn forever into a beast because their beast form wich i have theoriesed of being a seperate entity because the beast wants to be present full time what if the snake wasn't powerfull enough until  years to stay completely into snake form and that the human nagini is powerfull enough to change back into a human and then at some point snake nagini would be more powerfull that human nagini and the snake would be in control this is working great it explains why humain nagini will be afraid of her snake form and maybe we could see her randomly transform into a snake only because the snake entity is itself wanting to be a full time being so to recapitulate when a maledictus is in a form lets say human it has its other form snake of nagini's case in itself and it can see what the other one is doing the same aplyes vice versa then when human nagini transform is at will until the snake's maledictus powers become too powerfull so it isn't that the curse will enevitably transform nagini into a snake but more like the snake will have enough power to stay into snake form forever but the snake can still chose to become humain but since it isn't

(This is working great, it explains why Humain Nagini will be afraid of her snake form and maybe we could see her randomly transform into a snake only because the snake entity is itself wanting to be a full-time being).  So to recapitulate, when a Maledictus is in a form (lets say human) it has its other form (snake of Nagini's case) in itself and it can see what the other one is doing (the same aplyes vice-versa).  Then when Human Nagini transform is at will until the Snake's Maledictus powers become too powerfull, so it isn't that the curse will enevitably transform Nagini into a snake, but more like the Snake will have enough power to stay into Snake form forever, but the Snake can still chose to become humain, but since it isn't really her, why would she do so?

4098,spoilers my review of fantastic beasts from the nyc lumos benefit i walked in to fantastic beasts a little disenchanted but really expecting to like it more than cursed child which i'd rate at a a solid c or b i saw cursed child in london did not read the screenplay and while i hate saying this i found myself unable to clap at the end credits of fantastic beasts because i actually really hated it i'm surprised to use the word hated for this film btw jk rowling in the flesh was amazing definitely got teary eyed she is so beautiful and lovely and okay i was more than teary eyed i sobbed ultimately however fb suffered from the same things i disliked in cc in short it needs a heavy edit many scenes characters lines should have been cut way too long the pov kept changing and wasn't really explained there were many plot points together at once and none of them stood out/were particularly interesting also it was really hard to tell all the white men apart just saying i had to be like oh this white guy is the senator this white guy is the senator's father which i'm not even sure why they had the senator subplot or characters in the first place took up a good half hour of the film for nothing some issues with hp canon though minor compared to cc i e if newt was kicked out of hogwarts why didn't they break his wand actor wise eddie redmayne is what you'd expect he is good but newt scamander honestly isn't super likeable i disliked tina goldstein there was nothing interesting about her we know they get married it says so in the hp series but i can't think of two characters/actors who have less chemistry than newt and tina the no maj kowalski was fine he had some funny lines but nothing felt outstanding and there was some fat shaming for him that is simply not okay in  by far and away alison sudol as queenie was the best queenie was the most interesting of the characters and the most that i could actually see in the world also enjoyed the president of macusa and the niffler everyone loved the niffler i loved the niffler in fact had this film just been queenie and the niffler it would have been my favorite thing ezra miller's character credence and his story was fascinating but there was way too much backstory that wasn't properly shown i get what the backstory was but i feel like an abused child should warrant more emotion than it did and i didn't understand anything with this adopted sister i'm sure she'll be back in a subsequent film but it was way too much to deal with that didn't make sense and then like as quick as credence became interesting it was over with odd choice other issues i took with the film diversity you just can't have harlem in  with all white people you can't johnny depp why in the world did they cast a man who beat his wife in this did they not have a better option predictability one of the greatest strengths of the hp series is how everything comes together seamlessly unsure if maybe i'm older or the fact i work in children's publishing or what but i correctly guessed on every occasion what would happen cgi was star wars prequels levels of bad in that it was okay but wayyyyy too much in fact much of this felt very star wars prequels to me she's completely george lucas'ing herself also the movie doesn't set itself up for a next one at the end so i have no idea where they're gonna go with this

which I'd rate at a a solid C+ or B- (I saw Cursed Child in London, did not read the screenplay). And while I hate saying this, I found myself unable to clap at the end credits of Fantastic Beasts because . . . I actually really hated it.  (I'm surprised to use the word hated for this film btw.)  JK Rowling in the flesh was amazing, definitely got teary eyed. She is so beautiful and lovely and okay I was more than teary eyed, I sobbed.   Ultimately, however, FB suffered from the same things I disliked in CC—in short, it needs a HEAVY edit. Many scenes, characters, lines should have been cut. Way too long. The POV kept changing and wasn't really explained. There were MANY plot points together at once, and none of them stood out/were particularly interesting. Also, it was really hard to tell all the white men apart. Just saying. I had to be like, ""oh, this white guy is the senator, this white guy is the senator's father."" Which I'm not even sure why they had the senator subplot or characters in the first place . . . took up a good half hour of the film for nothing.  Some issues with HP canon, though minor compared to CC. (i.e.: If Newt was kicked out of Hogwarts, why didn't they break his wand??)  Actor-wise: Eddie Redmayne is what you'd expect. He is good, but Newt Scamander honestly isn't super likeable. I disliked Tina Goldstein. There was nothing interesting about her. We know they get married (it says so in the HP series) but I can't think of two characters/actors who have less chemistry than Newt and Tina. The no-maj, Kowalski, was fine. He had some funny lines but nothing felt OUTSTANDING, and there was some fat shaming for him that is simply not okay in 2016. By far and away Alison Sudol as Queenie was the best. Queenie was the most interesting of the characters and the most that I could actually see in the world. Also enjoyed the president of MACUSA. And the niffler. Everyone LOVED the niffler. I loved the niffler. In fact, had this film just been Queenie and the niffler it would have been my favorite thing.  Ezra Miller's character Credence and his story was fascinating, but there was way too much backstory that wasn't properly shown. (I get what the backstory was, but I feel like an abused child should warrant more emotion than it did. And I didn't understand anything with this adopted sister. I'm sure she'll be back in a subsequent film but it was way too much to deal with that didn't make sense). And then like, as quick as Credence became interesting, it was over with. Odd choice.  Other issues I took with the film: DIVERSITY. You just can't have Harlem in 1920 with all white people. You can't.  JOHNNY DEPP. Why in the world did they cast a man who beat his wife in this?!? Did they not have a better option?  PREDICTABILITY. One of the greatest strengths of the HP series is how everything comes together seamlessly. Unsure if maybe I'm older, or the fact I work in children's publishing, or what, but I correctly guessed on EVERY occasion what would happen.  CGI was Star Wars prequels levels of bad, in that it was okay, but wayyyyy too much. In fact much of this felt very Star Wars prequels to me. She's completely George Lucas'ing herself.   Also, the movie doesn't set itself up for a next one at the end. So I have no idea where they're gonna go with this?? Someone help because I truly want to understand. It's just odd.  Overall: Hard plot to follow, unlikeable characters, generally not interesting. I'd see it, but when you can rent it from Amazon or iTunes for $3."

was totally fangurling i m a bloke on the revelations around nagini and started thinking about other magical creatures throughout the books and how they could be brought into the movies i came to fawkes and stopped short surely there must be a backstory to be shown for how dumbledore met the phoenix it would all tie in with the fantastic beasts franchise and would be another link in with the potter books/films i have a feeling that this would be too good an opportunity to miss for jkr i now imagine newt has something to do with dumbledore and fawkes coming together if this does come about in the upcoming cog it could be along the lines of fawkes being captive in this magical circus and that he is mistreated/abused for the amusement/wonder of the gold paying public newt/dumbledore investigating the snake woman act now known to be nagini witnesses the phoenix being brought on to the stage as a dazzling closing piece of the show and can see how neglected he is and so vows to save him i also think there is a chance fawkes tears which have crazy good healing powers could be being misused in the circus against his will to cure any injuries within the circus including the likes of nagini s venomous bites as seen in ootp with arthur weasley extremely difficult to cure this could also explain how fawkes knew harry was in need of his tears in cos after his near deadly battle with the basilisk i m probably thinking way too deeply about this but it would all explain a lot about the relationship between fawkes and dumbledore they were companions through until the latters death whereby fawkes displays his sadness through the phoenix s lament emitting a ghostly and extremely sorrowful song at the loss of his friend before he leaves hogwarts this kind of shows to me that he was there with dumbledore voluntarily of his own will and most likely not as a pet and had a huge understanding of the events ongoing around him displaying compassion and intelligence beyond that of a common pet even for a magical one i did tweet jkr a few days ago with a short question about all of this but understandably and predictably i never got a reply haha does anyone think i m completely wrong or right or have any predictions of their own,fawk so i wa sit the other day after recent finish re read the potter book and end up onlin go through forum base on link between the novel and the upcom fb movi i wa total fangurl i m a bloke on the revel around nagini and start think about other magic creatur throughout the book and how they could be brought into the movi i came to fawk and stop short sure there must be a backstori to be shown for how dumbledor met the phoenix it would all tie in with the fantast beast franchis and would be anoth link in with the potter books/film i have a feel that thi would be too good an opportun to miss for jkr i now imagin newt ha someth to do with dumbledor and fawk come togeth if thi doe come about in the upcom cog it could be along the line of

wrong or right or have ani predict of their own,"Fawkes So, I was sitting the other day after recently finishing re-reading the Potter books and ended up online going through forums based on links between the novels and the upcoming FB movies.   I was totally fangurling (I’m a bloke) on the revelations around Nagini, and started thinking about other magical creatures throughout the books and how they could be brought into the movies.   I came to Fawkes, and stopped short. Surely, there MUST be a backstory  to be shown for how Dumbledore met the Phoenix. It would all tie in with the Fantastic Beasts franchise, and would be another link-in with the Potter books/films.   I have a feeling that this would be too good an opportunity to miss for JKR; I now imagine Newt has something to do with Dumbledore and Fawkes coming together. If this does come about in the upcoming CoG, it could be along the lines of Fawkes being captive in this magical circus, and that he is mistreated/abused for the amusement/wonder of the gold-paying public.   Newt/Dumbledore, investigating the ‘Snake-Woman’ act now known to be Nagini, witnesses the Phoenix being brought on to the stage as a dazzling closing-piece of the show, and can see how neglected he is, and so vows to save him.   I also think there is a chance Fawkes’ tears, which have crazy-good healing powers, could be being misused in the circus against his will to cure any injuries within the circus, including the likes of Nagini’s venomous bites (as seen in OotP with Arthur Weasley, extremely difficult to cure).   This could also explain how Fawkes knew Harry was in need of his tears in CoS after his near-deadly battle with the Basilisk...  I’m probably thinking way too deeply about this, but it would all explain a lot about the relationship between Fawkes and Dumbledore, they were companions through until the latters death, whereby Fawkes displays his sadness through the ‘Phoenix’s Lament’, emitting a ghostly and extremely sorrowful song at the loss of his friend before he leaves Hogwarts.   This kind of shows to me that he was there with Dumbledore voluntarily, of his own will, and most likely NOT as a pet, and had a huge understanding of the events ongoing around him, displaying compassion and intelligence beyond that of a common ‘pet’, even for a magical one.   I did tweet JKR a few days ago with a short question about all of this, but understandably and predictably I never got a reply haha.   Does anyone think I’m completely wrong, or right, or have any predictions of their own?"

neck. “I might just have to report you to the ministry.” “Well then, I’ll just have to use my wand for the rest of the evening then”, he purred and placed her hand over his hard bulge.  “Professor, I never knew you could be such a smooth talker”, she panted, finally done with the buttons. His abdomen was surprisingly strong. She felt she couldn’t get enough of touching him. How did he get such strong abs?  Meanwhile Snape's hands had roamed down to her thighs and found the wand belt, which he unceremoniously teared off. Then he found the jackpot. Hermione screamed as he started to touch her through her lace panties.  “If you don’t stop squirming I’m going to have to tie you to this table, miss Granger” Snape drawled, and Hermione nearly came just from the sound of his voice. How had she never noticed how sexy professor Snape’s voice was?  She couldn’t take the teasing anymore. Blindly she groped for his fly.  “Shut up, and use your wand, professor. Or I will have to report you.”  With a short chuckle Snape undid his fly and belt, pulled down his trousers, parted her underwear to the side and with a powerful thrust he was inside of her. Hermione threw her head back and moaned loudly.  “Excellent use of your wand, sir.” “Shut up, Granger”, he panted and started thrusting, bending down to kiss her at the same time. Hermione moaned into his mouth and grabbed his shoulders for leverage. She felt like she had never been so full in her life. Every time he thrust into her he hit her g-spot perfectly, sending her closer to the edge. She was just about to come crashing down when she heard something that almost made her heart stop.

He cursed under his breath, and swiftly pulled out of her, making her wince from the sudden loss. He tucked himself in, and wandlessly dressed himself. Within seconds he was standing there fully dressed as if nothing had happened, while she was still on the bench with her legs spread. She quickly closed them, suddenly embarrassed about the situation they found themselves in.  “I’ll go out and distract him while you, ah, get yourself decent”, he whispered, clearly not making eye contact with her. She blushed furiously as he strode out of the classroom.  “Oy, Snape”, Hermione heard Ron shout as Snape opened the door. “Have you seen Hermione?”  “As a matter of fact, I have”, she heard Snape answer. “She told me to give you her regards.”  There was a crack and a loud thud, and then silence. Without thinking Hermione ran for the door, only to find Ron unconscious outside, and Snape nowhere in sight. Ron already had a black eye that was swelling up by the second.  She couldn’t help but smile as she dropped Ron’s wand on top of him, then walked away."

Sometimes Dumbledore is thrown into the mix as a parallel to death.  & #   However, the way I see it, it's actually Albus Dumbledore who parallels the brother who died for love.  Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry are the main stars in this search for the Deathly Hallows. Adding Snape seems to be a bit weird to me.  After all, it was Dumbledore who fell to the temptation of seeing the dead again, and put on the ring without thoroughly checking it for curses. In essence, he died because he tried to see his loved ones again.  Yes, Snape also died because he wanted to protect Lily's legacy, but he kinda had nothing to do with the deathly hallows. So having him parallel the brother who died because he fell to the temptation of wanting to be with his loved one again seems a bit odd to me."

So in GoF Voldemort explained how when he was destroyed in Godrics Hollow he became less than a ghost. He escaped as a disembodied spirit of sorts and went into hiding. In DH Dumbledore says harry became an unintentional horcrux, meaning part of Voldemort's soul attached itself to baby harry.  So my question is, how did Voldemort escape as ""less than a ghost?"" Shouldn't the part that didn't attach to harry have died when his curse rebounded? So there shouldn't have been any part of him/his soul to escape.   If I'm not being clear enough let me know. I'll try to elaborate."

Now, I'm aware that the book was written like two decades before the movie came out, so I'm sure Theseus was created as an afterthought, to make  Newt's struggle more personal, but the omission is still bound to raise questions. Do you think he might die in one of the later sequels? Or, even worse, he might betray the Ministry and join Grindelwald. THAT would certainty explain his omission in the biography section of Newt's future book, if he betrayed Newt, and hurt him so badly Newt couldn't bear to write his name, similar to how Dumbledore never brought up his OWN family in conversation. It was still too sore a spot. But anyway these are just theories. What you think?"

Langdon Shaw, the senator's brother felt vindicated that it was the work of witches. He stood [drunkenly] triumphant after his brother was murder by the obscurus and then stood very visibly happy when he arrived at the final scene with all the destruction. The camera makes specific captures of his reaction. He might need a reminder, but I think his memory returns in the future movies (maybe through a prompt, like Kowalski had with Queenie), and might help spur the story. Or it's a complete red herring. *Kowalski, analysis!*"

that singular role for his entire tenure also even if it is the only subject that he taught dumbledore could have taken over for a spell see what i did there due to a sabbatical illness vacation etc

t wait to see how thi one play out,"In defense of Fantastic Beasts and supposed “plot holes” I’m of the belief that no one understands Wizarding World universe more than Rowling, its author and creator.  Film critics, casual fans, and even hardcore fans seem to be under the impression that they know better than Rowling and that she is failing this series and keep pointing to major “plot holes”, and I just don’t buy it.   The plot hole gripes I see most often:  1.  ~Minerva McGonnagall shouldn’t be in the film, she was born in 1935~  This one seems to be the most pervasive. First off, the 1935 date is fanon not canon, an actual birth year has never been given in canon. Rather than copy-paste, here is an excellent article with a solid argument that McGonnagall is in fact much older and that it does not violate canon.  https://www.hypable.com/when-was-mcgonagall-born-age/   2.  ~At the end of the film Newt and Co should not have been able to apparate onto Hogwarts grounds~  The answer here is obvious. In the Harry Potter series Dumbledore is not only the sole exception to this rule but he is able to lift those restrictions as well:  “As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.”  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.359  And  ""As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed."" Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.544  It stands to reason that, as Dumbledore is the both the exception to the apparition rule and the executor of its enforcement, he created the rule himself after becoming headmaster, either in response to growing tensions in Grindelwald’s rise to power, as a result of an incident that we are not yet aware of, or due to the need for security during the First Wizarding War.  3.  ~Dumbledore was a transfiguration teacher, not Defense against the dark arts~  Here’s a forehead slapper. Dumbledore taught more than one subject in his history at Hogwarts.  In Book 1 Quirrel is a returning, known professor at Hogwarts and yet it his first year teaching DADA, yet no one seems to have a problem with this. In Crimes of Grindelwald we witnessed the Ministry of Magic banning Dumbledore from the position of professor of DADA, so he changed subjects.  The other issue that comes up is that in Half Blood Prince we learn that Tom Riddle wanted to take over the position of DADA instructor from Galatea Merrythought, who taught at Hogwarts for nearly 50 years. Yet, we do not know that he was in that singular role for his entire tenure. Also, even if it is the only subject that he taught Dumbledore could have taken over for a spell (see what I did there?) due to a sabbatical, illness, vacation etc.. Remember that Hagrid only taught Care of Magical Creatures and yet this was temporarily taken over by Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.  4. ~Accio Niffler shouldn’t work, the spell does not work on living things~  While Accio shouldn’t work on a living thing it would work on the objects that the Niffler was carrying in its pouch:   ""'Accio' only works on inanimate objects. While people or creatures may be indirectly moved by 'Accio-ing'objects that they are wearing or holding, this carries all kinds of risks because of the likelihood of injury to the person or beast attached to an object travelling at close to the speed of light."" -Jk Rowling   This one seems more problematic at first because of the, I must say, fantastic jewelry store scene in the first film. Why didn’t Newt use the spell in that scene? Comic relief people! Haha. No really, I think there was more risk to the Niffler.  In the second film they are out in the open and there is no obstruction between them. Boom.  4. ~The Mirror Of Erised is supposed to show you what you most desire but for Dumbledore it seems to show him the past~  This one is simple, we’ve always known that the Mirror of Erised is multifunctional. Harry Potter Book 1, the mirror shows Harry that the Sorcerer’s Stone was in his pocket. He wasn’t seeing it because he desired to see it there, it was revealing to him a truth of which he was unaware.   Also, Dumbledore is a bad ass wizard with incredible command of magic. Perhaps he just desired to see the past.   5. ~Aurelius what? Dumbledore only had two siblings, Arianna and Aberforth~  I whole heartedly agree with you. Practically speaking the dates do not add up: Dumbledore's father, Percival, was sentenced to life in Azkaban when the three Dumbledore children were still very young. Dumbledore's mother, Kendra, died years later in 1899.  Credence is 18 years old in the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film, which makes his birth year either 1907 or 1908, it’s not possible.   Why trust the word of Grindelwald, who’s entire character arch has been that of a liar and master manipulator? He definitely did not think that Credence was a Dumbledore in film one, when and how would he have learned this? What’s clear is that Grindelwald is grooming Credence to be his weapon against Dumbledore.   Crimes of Grindelwald was largely about Credence seeking an identity; he begins at his weakest and most vulnerable state his purpose to find his identity, and ultimately Grindelwald empowers him by giving him a false identity through which he can enact Grindelwald’s purpose. It’s an allegory for how people are seduced by fascism. This whole series in fact is an allegory about danger of fascism and eugenics, so Jk Rowling. Consider that the story takes place between 1926-45 which mirrors the rise and fall of European fascism and we are following a tyrant who wants a special class of people to rule.   As to whether there is a parcel of truth in his story.. it could be that the obscurus itself once lived in Arianna, so he’s a Dumbledore in a sense. Ariana means Silver in Welsh and Aurelius means Gold in Latin; we know that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were pursuing alchemical knowledge. My guess is that Grindelwald was somehow using alchemy to extract Ariana’s obscurus which lead to the confrontation that ultimately killed Ariana.  -  Personally, I’m over the moon that Rowling is writing the script. I imagine the knee jerk reaction by critics and fandom against this franchise is largely due to the fact that this is not a traditional film series, this is not Star Wars.  A master author who writes complex ring structured novels has the unprecedented position of having total control of the screenplays. This will end up being a very different movie series because of this, the films will play out like a novel with slower complex reveals that will break the Hollywood mold and upset people along the way, I think that’s s great thing.   Personally, I’m stoked on the series. It has the fandom analyzing and theorizing in a way that hasn’t happened since the Harry Potter book series. We all know Jk Rowling can tell a great story, I can’t wait to see how this one plays out."

And overall, I loved it! Immediate takeaways are:   I'm a little annoyed with how everyone tries to tie up Snape's ending with a neat little bow. I get he sacrificed and was basically one of the good guys, but he wasn't a very GOOD good guy. And in the end, he still didn't care for Harry. Yet Harry names his kid after the guy. 🤷‍♀️  I really love book Ginny and Harry together, I wish we had seen more of their relationship develope. But that is probably because I'm an adult and these books are for children. Also, I didn't care for movie Ginny so it was a pleasant surprise to see this book version of her and love her, she's a spitfire and it's great!   Super annoyed that Tonks ran into battle after Lupin and left their baby behind knowing they might not make it out. Again, I get it was to make a better world, but... I'm a mother, so I guess I just could not stand the idea of leaving my child an orphan.   You can tell I'm a grown woman in my 30s with kids because the teen angst got on my nerves, I'm mom shaming Tonks, and I relate the most to Molly Weasley 😂😂😂😂   Anyway, there are so many other things I could discuss, but this is all I can come up with now. I've been rewatching the movies as I'm reading, so I'm excited to rewatch Deathly Hallows 1& 2! Then I suppose I will give Cursed Child a chance.   Any good fanfic recommendations though?!"

1895,i always wondered what would have happened if everyone hadn't warned harry off of slytherins or if lucius hadn't entered madam malkin's and hagrid had stayed away a bit longer would draco have made a better impression on harry yes little malfoy is pompous and a bit full of himself when they have their very first encounter but from both the book and the movie dray seemed really excited to get a potential new friend you could tell he was extremely disappointed when harry turned down his friendship due to the bad blood between the weasley's and draco's own crude and rude behavior it's not an excuse for his terrible behavior but he was hurt by harry and acted as the spoiled child they are with an inferiority complex who was used to getting whatever they wanted add to the fact that draco is so desperately trying to be the perfect malfoy/son and has daddy issues just as deep and vast as the black lake it's a wonder he himself lasted as long as he did without becoming a de and yes i am one of those who firmly believes that he was under duress and only took on the mark to stay close to his mother who i'm pretty sure wasn't a death eater so after finding out that the boy he was talking to turned out to be the harry potter i'm sure that crushed his pureblood pride even more not being liked by someone draco probably looked up to definitely didn't help his feelings for the golden trio as the years past plus we know lucius is _whispering _ yelling in his sons ear about all that blood purity bigotry after all hate is taught remembering the first book ron instigates a lot of their fights/squabbles and the weasley's are just as guilty here for letting all that bad blood dictate whom they speak to i imagine that draco had been a little bit respectful towards ron and hermione the story would have went a different way idk it just makes me wonder would harry had been so adamant about being placed in gryffindor if he hadn't been warned that all slytherin's are evil

himself when they have their very first encounter, but from both the book and the movie, Dray seemed really excited to get a potential new friend. You could tell he was extremely disappointed when Harry turned down his friendship due to the bad blood between the Weasley's ***and*** Draco's own crude and rude behavior.   ...It's **not** an excuse for his terrible behavior, but he was hurt by Harry and acted as the spoiled child they are - with an inferiority complex who was used to getting whatever they wanted (~~add to the fact that Draco is so desperately trying to be the ""perfect"" Malfoy/son and has daddy issues just as deep and vast as the Black Lake) it's a wonder he himself lasted as long as he did without becoming a DE...~~ And yes, I am one of those who ***firmly*** believes that he was under duress and only took on the mark to stay close to his mother, who I'm pretty sure **wasn't** a Death Eater.) So after finding out that the boy he was talking to turned out to be *the* ***Harry Potter***, I'm sure that crushed his Pureblood pride even more. Not being liked by someone Draco probably looked up to definitely didn't help his feelings for the Golden Trio as the years past. Plus we know Lucius is _whispering _ *yelling* in his sons ear about all that blood purity bigotry. After all hate is taught.   Remembering the first book, Ron instigates a lot of their fights/squabbles...and the Weasley's are just as guilty here for letting all that bad blood dictate whom they speak to... I imagine that Draco had been a little bit respectful towards Ron (and Hermione) the story would have went a different way.   Idk. It just makes me wonder... Would Harry had been so adamant about being placed in Gryffindor if he hadn't been warned that all Slytherin's are evil snake bastards."

So I found a Harry Potter item ( photos including of the front and back) at a cash converters ( cash converters is a pawn shop in Australia for those of you who don't know) for $20 AUD. I was wondering if anyone could tell me if this item could possible be fanmade/ fake or a legit Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows limited edition item. If this is a real thing piece of harry potter merch i wonder if anyone knows what is the story of this piece. I feel like it is real and not a fan made thing is because the picture in the middle with Harry, Ron and Hermione have the autographs the the three actors who play then and it is item 51 out of 250. If you, whoever is reading this might know, or if you know someone who might know, please post a comment or send it to your friend or whoever you know because i really want to know what this item is.  A side note, I tried googling this but because there is no name of what it is on the front or the back I came to an dead end. I even tried searching by image but even that came to an dead end.  **FOR WHOEVER KNOWS WHAT THIS IS THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR TELLING ME WHAT THIS IS!!!!!!!!!!!**  **ALSO WHOEVER IS READING THIS THANK YOU FOR READING THIS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.**  [This is the front ](https://i.redd.it/opzpwjde40u21.jpg)  [This is the back](https://i.redd.it/qpos5ulc40u21.jpg)"

While I'm all for the theory that's floating about on Credence simply being a host for Ariana's obscurial (which indirectly makes him related to Dumbledore), I can't help but wonder if Grindelwald is lying.  As much as I don't want to believe that Grindelwald is making up some elaborate lie to win Credence over (as it's too much of a cop out and very un-JK like) if this isn't the case - then why did Grindelwald make sure the elf woman was killed?  I have no particular theory on this and would just like to know everyone else's thoughts on this plot point.   Did Grindelwald have her killed just so he could be the one to tell Credence? Or, did he have her killed to prevent him from learning the truth?"

I love that HP fans now have so much choice and selections of clothing they can wear to show their colours and fandom and I've loved watching all the badges and scarfs and jewellery and accessories that have become available.  However it seems to have come with a slightly sad negative aspect. It used to be (bear in mind if been I've been a HP fan for nearly 15 years) that if you saw someone with the house colours or Hogwarts emblem on you could stop and have an awesome conversation with a stranger about the world we all love but today a walked past a 20 or something year old girl (I'm a girl) who was wearing a Hufflepuff puff jumper and I said ""oh your a Hufflepuff I'm a Gryffindor"" she responded ""um.....

died then and started another family and had a son then there is no way credelius is albus's brother let alone a dumbledore which brings me to my theory i believe gellert was only half lying to

powerful wizard he can use to defeat dumbledore we know that credence is very powerful and is even more so thanks to being a obscurus we also see at the end of cog that gellert gives credence a wand and what are the chances of him just having a wand that will work for credence i theorize that credence barebone is actually credence grindelwald and the reason why the wand works so well for credence

grindelwald,"SPOILERS. Credence Theory. Credence Barebone is actually a Grindelwald?  At the end of Crimes of Grindelwald, Gellert tells Credence two things,  1. His real name is Aurelius Dumbledore  2. His brother is moving against him  There are many theories around this. A couple of them are,   1. Gellert is telling the truth and Credence is really Aurelis Dumbledore.  2. Gellert is lying to try and manipulate Credence/Aurelis #Credelius into going after Albus because Gellert can't due to the bloodpact.  The 2nd is very possible but what about the first?  Percival Dumbledore (Albus's father) was sent to Azkaban for life before Albus started at Hogwarts and supposedly died shortly after.  His mother, Kendra, died shortly after Albus graduated from Hogwarts.  So unless Percival somehow escaped from Azkaban after Ariana died then and started another family and had a son then there is no way Credelius is Albus's brother let alone a Dumbledore...  Which brings me to my theory.  I believe Gellert was only half lying to Credence, telling him that he is Arelius Dumbledore is a lie to get him to specifically target Dumbledore, but the part about his ""Brother moving against him"" is true and he planted the Phoenix chick for Credence to find to back up his lie.  In Crimes of Grindelwald we know that Albus and Gellert can't attack one another due to the bloodpact they made between them so Gellert needs to find another powerful wizard he can use to defeat Dumbledore.  We know that Credence is very powerful and is even more so thanks to being a Obscurus.  We also see at the end of CoG that Gellert gives Credence a wand, and what are the chances of him just having a wand that will work for Credence?  I theorize that Credence Barebone is actually Credence Grindelwald and the reason why the wand works so well for Credence is because, much like how Ron Weasley was using his older brothers wand in the first two Harry Potter books, Credence is using the wand of his elder brother, Gellert Grindelwald."

[story concept] Hey! I’m a Criminological Sciences student. I’m currently, while writing this post, in my second year of University. As you could see, I’m interested in learning about crime and all that comes with it.  This whole part will all make sense later on.   I am a big fan of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. I am currently listening to the audiobooks and got some inspiration from the first book. In the first book, fifth chapter (The Philosophers Stone, Diagon Alley) Hagrid and Harry go to Diagon Alley, where they firstly visit Gringotts. Gringotts is the bank for wizards. Hagrid tells Harry about the highly secured bank. He tells Harry that there are rumors a dragon guards the banks and their safes (later comfirmed there indeed is a dragon). Further, the bank is secured using spells, enchantments and the goblins themselves.   To link both parts of this post. When riding the train on my way to University, listening to my audiobook, I thought to myself about a story involving a crime taking place in Gringotts.   I have been imagining a story where a Dark Wizard, an old follower of You Know Who, masterminds a plan to break into Gringotts (possibly with other outlaws). It would show the dark side of the Wizarding World we all fell in love with. Further, the story would emphasize on the dark spells and other magical things.   As for the timeline, I was thinking of making the story taking place years after Harry’s story due to the main character being an old follower of You Know Who.   Thank you for reading this post. I hope you all like this idea. I made a similar post a couple hours ago as a quick idea."

Hi there :)  Another FB theory, I think I discovered something :)  It's easy to assume that Dumbledore got his phoenix Fawkes from his befriended magizoologist who has travelled the world and most likely isn't done rescuing illegaly trafficed animals either... but the timeline fits as well :)  ___________________________________________________________  **The Timeline**   Fawkes was born before 1938, when his tail feathers were given to Mr. Ollivander to eventually fabricate the wands for Tom Riddle and Harry Potter...  Voldemort was born in 1926... which leaves us, since he was born on New Years' Eve, with 11 years. And since the next movie will take place in 1928 - we still have 10 years.  Enough time for Newt to find and give Dumbledore a phoenix egg.   __________________________________________________________   **The Reason**  I believe Newt's reason for this present wasn't just sympathy, knowing Fawkes would be in good hands and that this was his teacher's patronus form... I think he also wants to give him a companion... The reason why Newt and Dumbledore became so close is possibly that they both are lonely people... Dumbledore for being too respected among and having lost most of his family, and Newt for struggling among people.  Yet he has his creatures and eventually finds some good friends...

Sorry if someone already made a post on this.  Some people think Credence was both a Dumbledore and a Gaunt, specifically Albus Dumbledore's half brother and Tom Marvolo Riddle's uncle. Anyone agree with this? I honestly don't see how that works in the first place.  If he was Kendra's son by Marvolo (lol), he wouldn't have been a Dumbledore. Kendra wasn't a Dumbledore by blood. If he was Percival's son by Mrs Gaunt, then he wouldn't have been a Gaunt. Even if we assume Mrs Gaunt was her husband's paternal parallel cousin or even his sister, and thus a Gaunt by blood, I don't see how she could have had a child older than Merope by an imprisoned man. Morfin may have been born in 1901 so how would Credence also be?  Thoughts?"

I suppose with the adults, it makes some sense. They actually have personal memories of Voldemort at the height of his power.  But what about the kids who are Harry's age? They just know Voldemort as a historical figure. I know all the terrible things Hitler did, but if you say his name, I'm not going to cringe in fear.  Is it supposed to remind people of all the terrible atrocities he committed? If so, how does saying ""You-know-who"" or ""the dark lord"" or ""he-who-must-not-be-named"" avoid bringing up those painful memories?  The absolute closest I can think of to a muggle analogue for this is the N-word. That racial slur is the one thing 99.99999999% of non-racists refuse to say, even if they are totally comfortable saying every other expletive under the sun. Even message boards that allow you to say fuck, shit, and bitch will still either censor the N-word with astericks or not allow you to submit the post at all if the post contains it.  But that has less to do with fear of any specific Hitler analog, and a lot more to do with how degrading it is to a certain ethnic group. Dumbledore isn't advocating for people to start using the N-word because that's Voldemort's proper name, and fear of the N-word only increases fear of black people themselves.  So even then, it still isn't a perfect fit.  So what the hell? Why are people so scared of the French translation of ""flight from death?"""

when using the time turner as to not mess with time itself/person who uses it. even if the ministry enforced the max 5 hour rule post dumbledore/grindelwald duel, wouldn’t her working at hogwarts before her birthday mess with her life path? the history we know of time turners would go against her traveling so far back—the history which, funnily enough, came from mcgonagall herself. see this excerpt from pottermore from professor croaker, unspeakable in charge of time (written by jo herself..sorry for formatting, i’m on mobile):  •”It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”. Finally, there were alarming signs, during the days following Madam Mintumble’s recovery, that time itself had been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up and since that time, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those studying time travel.  SO.  i get wanting to have a little wink to harry’s era, but i don’t understand having the familiarity component if it doesn’t add up to what we’ve learned from canon. we see what too much time travel can do (ex. cursed child...i know this is a contentious reference, sorry). i love mcgonagall so much (she’s the witch version of my middle school english teacher, who i adored) and i love her story, so i’m just kind of annoyed to have a wrench thrown into it haha.   so what do y’all think: continuity mess up or a grand time turner plot that will have a wonky explanation? i know some people are saying it doesn’t matter in the long run, but sloppiness is definitely concerning."

Basically, no magic (or virtually no magic) is allowed in the process.  Wood must be cut with a saw. Holes must done with a drill. Shaping must done with a lathe. Wand cores need to be threaded with a needle (or embedded via some other means).  There is very little info regarding the literal tools of the trade. I came up with this idea of no magic in wandcrafting by justifying it as the safe handling of wand core materials.   Basically given that the wand core materials are highly sensitive to magic, any slip ups in any spells casted to save labor can have potentially disasterous results as it might set off some sort of magical chain reaction, usually an explosion of some sort."

My first and most important question, could  Credence be the brother of Dumbledore? Is it canon? I haven’t read the books in some time but I cant remember any references except Ariana and Abeforth On the other hand the Phoenix part makes sense to me so I’m really confused  Secondly, what about Grindewald’s character, ( and I’m not talking about Johnny Depp’s acting,I really like him and I don’t mind him playing Grindewald). In my opinion,especially in the cemetary scene where he is talking about muggles and WW2 , they made him seem like a good leader that just wants to protect wizards, not necessarily killing muggles that mean no harm, and that really contrasts with what I had in my mind ( that he is very similar to Voldemort) And lastly, what about Queenie, is she bad after all,or just confused?  Sorry for the long post, I really would like to read some opinions on these subjects or anything about the movie, Thanks ❤️"

It's our harry potter tradition to watch it together in the theater.   & #   But something strange happened. 40 minutes in or so, I thought, wait a minute, I actually like this movie a lot more then the first time. O lot of thing that I didn't understand the first time, I understood now.But still, there are problem with this movie, and the problems are JK's script mostly. I din't like how Yates did the action scenes, i always thought that he couldn't direct action very well. But this movie has so much in it, that you NEED to see it twice. But the problem is, why would someone see it twice if he didn't like it the first time ? With me, it was just  a coincidence. But I think you just need to see it twice to understand it better.  & #   In the end, I will just say, I really hope this movie will make some money, so that WB still makes a 3rd movie. Strange to say this about Harry Potter, but the fucked it up, make the 3rd movie the best way possible."

1927,do witches and wizards get more powerful over time i think so so my theory is that the average witch or wizard gets more powerful over time and by extension the more powerful ones would get more powerful too as time goes by witches and wizards will just learn more adapt and find different ways to become more powerful i believe this is a similar case to how isaac newton is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of his day but really today s high schoolers know more than he ever did i believe if you took moody or kingsley and threw them back to  a d they would defeat any of the hogwarts founders in a duel perhaps  at once too even though they were considered as  of the greatest of their day now maybe the biggest argument against my theory is that witches and wizards just don t develop the same way as humans but i m calling rubbish on this as well snape a modern wizard still managed to invent a lot of spells in general when people realize that something fails they try something new that s even better and it s hard to believe this method isn t applied in the wizarding world as well besides it s not just the creation of spells it s learning how to maximize different spells in a duel too,do witch and wizard get more power over time i think so so my theori is that the averag witch or wizard get more power over time and by extens the more power one would get more power too as time goe by witch and wizard will just learn more adapt and find differ way to becom more power i believ thi is a similar case to how isaac newton is regard as one of the greatest scientist of hi day but realli today s high schooler know more than he ever did i believ if you took moodi or kingsley and threw them back to  a d they would defeat ani of the hogwart founder in a duel perhap  at onc too even though they were consid as  of the greatest of their day now mayb the biggest argument against my theori is that witch and wizard just don t develop the same way as human but i m call rubbish on thi as well snape a modern wizard still manag to invent a lot of spell in gener when peopl realiz that someth fail they tri someth new that s even better and it s hard to believ thi method isn t appli in the wizard world as well besid it s not just the creation of spell it s learn how to maxim differ spell in a duel too,do witch and wizard get more power over time i think so so my theori is that the averag witch or wizard get more power over time and by extens the more power one would get more power too as time goe by witch and wizard will just learn more adapt and find differ way to becom more power i believ thi is a similar case to how isaac newton is regard as one of the greatest scientist of hi day but realli today s high schooler know more than he ever did i believ if you took moodi or kingsley and threw them back to  a d they would defeat ani of the hogwart founder in a duel perhap  at onc too even though they were consid as  of the greatest of their day now mayb the biggest argument against my theori is that witch and wizard just don t develop the same way as human but i m call rubbish on thi as well snape a modern wizard still manag to invent a lot of spell in gener when peopl realiz that someth fail they tri someth new that s even better and it s hard to believ thi method isn t appli in the wizard world as well besid it s not just the creation of spell it s learn how to maxim differ spell in a duel too,"Do witches and wizards get more powerful over time? I think so. So, my theory is that the average witch or wizard gets more powerful over time, and by extension, the more powerful ones would get more powerful too. As time goes by, witches and wizards will just learn more, adapt, and find different ways to become more powerful. I believe this is a similar case to how Isaac Newton is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of his day, but really today’s high-schoolers know more than he ever did.   I believe if you took Moody or Kingsley and threw them back to 1000 A.D., they would defeat any of the Hogwarts founders in a duel, perhaps 2 at once too, even though they were considered as 4 of the greatest of their day.   Now, maybe the biggest argument against my theory is that witches and wizards just don’t develop the same way as humans, but I’m calling rubbish on this as well. Snape, a modern wizard, still managed to invent a lot of spells. In general, when people realize that something fails, they try something new that’s even better, and it’s hard to believe this method isn’t applied in the Wizarding world as well. Besides, it’s not just the creation of spells, it’s learning how to maximize different spells in a duel too!"

I started watching Harry Potter at the end of 2018 and somehow this twist wasn’t spoiled for me. The writing and music is just so on point. Everything came full circle from Harry surviving the attack at Godrics Hollow to being a Horcrux himself.    The Snape twist was incredibly executed by Alan Rickman’s acting. Everything he did was to protect Harry out of his love for Lily. You can really feel the pain and despair Snape has felt throughout his life— never getting to be with the woman he loved.   There’s just so many raw human emotions that go into this. The realization Harry has that he’s lived his whole life figuring out the mystery of his childhood and now he needs to die for the greater good.   It’s the kind of great ending I was hoping we would get for Game of Thrones. One that catches you off guard but makes so much sense and the clues are there throughout the series.   Thought this scene deserved great recognition.

Even in the graveyard, in the Priori Incantantem scene, Diggory’s body comes out of Voldemort’s wand, again conveying that Voldemort killed him personally with his wand. However, when Cedric is murdered, the book has the section as Voldemort saying “Kill the spare” and then “a second voice” (pettigrew) casting Avada Kedavra. That seems pretty clear to me that Pettigrew is the one who actually killed him. If that’s the case, why did Cedric appear out of Voldemort’s wand in Priori, and why is such significance placed on the notion that Voldemort himself cast the killing curse that murdered Diggory? Am I missing something?"

1418,spoiler dumbledore's greatest desire isn't grindelwald as we know the books and the movies are kept conservative when it comes to dumbledore and grindelwald's relationship seeing grindelwald on the mirror of erised is probably the most confirmation we'll ever see in the actual movies anyway my theory is that dumbledore's greatest desire is the vial containing the blood oath the whole erised sequence showed the creation of the blood oath and then grindelwald who wears the vial so i think dumbledore's greatest desire is to get that vial so that he can finally fight grindelwald dumbledore most likely still has love for grindelwald but i think getting to hung up on his ex is a little bit immature he's a different person now from the person who was blindly head over heels with grindelwald and he probably understands that he needs to destroy him,spoiler dumbledore' greatest desir isn't grindelwald as we know the book and the movi are kept conserv when it come to dumbledor and grindelwald' relationship see grindelwald on the mirror of eris is probabl the most confirm we'll ever see in the actual movi anyway my theori is that dumbledore' greatest desir is the vial contain the blood oath the whole eris sequenc show the creation of the blood oath and then grindelwald who wear the vial so i think dumbledore' greatest desir is to get that vial so that he can final fight grindelwald dumbledor most like still ha love for grindelwald but i think get to hung up on hi ex is a littl bit immatur he' a differ person now from the person who wa blindli head over heel with grindelwald and he probabl understand that he need to destroy him,spoiler dumbledore' greatest desir isn't grindelwald as we know the book and the movi are kept conserv when it come to dumbledor and grindelwald' relationship see grindelwald on the mirror of eris is probabl the most confirm we'll ever see in the actual movi anyway my theori is that dumbledore' greatest desir is the vial contain the blood oath the whole eris sequenc show the creation of the blood oath and then grindelwald who wear the vial so i think dumbledore' greatest desir is to get that vial so that he can final fight grindelwald dumbledor most like still ha love for grindelwald but i think get to hung up on hi ex is a littl bit immatur he' a differ person now from the person who wa blindli head over heel with grindelwald and he probabl understand that he need to destroy him,"[SPOILER] Dumbledore's greatest desire isn't Grindelwald As we know, the books and the movies are kept conservative when it comes to Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship. Seeing Grindelwald on the Mirror of Erised is probably the most confirmation we'll ever see in the actual movies.   Anyway, my theory is that Dumbledore's greatest desire is the vial containing the blood oath.   The whole Erised sequence showed the creation of the blood oath and then Grindelwald, who *wears* the vial. So I think Dumbledore's greatest desire is to get that vial so that he can finally fight Grindelwald.   Dumbledore most likely still has love for Grindelwald, but I think getting to hung up on his ex is a little bit immature. He's a different person now from the person who was blindly head over heels with Grindelwald and he probably understands that he needs to destroy him."

But I do think that Ginny should’ve been with someone else (idk, Seamus or Dean) and Harry end up with Luna. Luna and Harry have more in common, and are cuter together imo.   Ginny is just.... Ginny. She isn’t a significant part of Harry’s life if she never dated him frankly. She’s just Ron’s brother, but she didn’t really contribute to the plot much other than romantic interest. Luna, however, was an important character and I think Luna and Harry would’ve been much better."

4012,the obscurus in the suitcase the truth theory spoiler hi there before we start this i have to make a confession i already made a theory on tumblr on the obscurus and where newt could have gotten it from and completely messed it up concerning the timeline it s deleted now today i m trying again because i m still convinced that we haven t been told the truth about this parasite in newt s suitcase so enjoy ___________________________________________ information so far when we are introduced to the obscurus in the movie we are told it s a parasite that is created when a young wizard or witch surpresses his magical powers it feeds on the powers but when it becomes too strong or when the wizard experiences strong negative emotions it breaks out becomes one with the wizard causes destruction around or kills it s host _______________________________________________________ newt s obscurus in the movie newt claims to have managed to seperate the obscurus from it s host a young girl in sudan yet when he tells the story to credence he suddenly leaves out her heritage and said story starts to sound identical to ariana dumbledore s it should also be pointed out that when asked what makes albus dumbledore so fond of him he refuses to answer something is going on here __________________________________________________ ariana s obscurus so could it be that he is actually been watching over ariana s obscurus this is where we get to my mistake from the last version of this theory ariana died in  when newt was only two years old he never met her in person but her brother he knew well but can an obscurus survive for an unlimited amount of time really i can only sum up what we get to see i can t wrap my mind around it yet the obscurus is said to be unable to survive outside the host yet when newt states this it s clearly alive and has been for the entire movie but i think this was just wrong words he probably meant that it can t harm anyone outside it s host the obscurus is said to be a parasite but it seems to be made out of energy can it die does it sleep until finding a new energy source does newt feed it with magic is he doing research on it considering the last point we can actually build up a story starting back in hogwarts ___________________________________________________ the story of albus dumbledore and newt scamander newt scamander and albus dumbledore had always been getting along very well and when dumbledore heard of a possible expelling of his student he of course wanted to help yet he knew that this student would also possibly be able to help him with a problem he had been keeping for years after his sister had died her obscurus remained he couldn t get himself to try kill it since it was part of his sister so he kept it locked away and started to research in order to help those who would be infected in the future without sucess he couldn t find a solution and then he met newt scamander the young man had an extrodinary talent concerning magical creatures and dumbledore found that someone like him could possibly find a solution so when he got expelled from hogwarts dumbledore offered to make possible he could keep his wand but just like with snape he asked something in return he introduced the young man to his secret and tragic family story and asked him to research on the parasite that had been destroying his sister for years newt agreed and hid it inside his suitcase to observe and research on it for the following years of course this had to be kept secret so he made up a story about a girl in sudan that he managed to seperate it from and when he talked to credence he told him the story of dumbledores sister he never had met _____________________________________________________ this is the secret that newt has been keeping just like he was asked to but when will we know for sure i think at one point in the story newt either opens up to someone about the secret or is given verita

it s host a young girl in sudan yet when he tell the stori to credenc he suddenli leav out her heritag and said stori start to sound ident to ariana dumbledor s it should also be point out that when ask what make albu dumbledor so fond of him he refus to answer someth is go on here __________________________________________________ ariana s obscuru so could it be that he is actual been watch over ariana s obscuru thi is where we get to my mistak from the last version of thi theori ariana die in  when newt wa onli two year old he never met her in person but her brother he knew well but can an obscuru surviv for an unlimit amount of time realli i can onli sum up what we get to see i can t wrap my mind around it yet the obscuru is said to be unabl to surviv outsid the host yet when newt state thi it s clearli aliv and ha been for the entir movi but i think thi wa just wrong word he probabl meant that it can t harm anyon outsid it s host the obscuru is said to be a parasit but it seem to be made out of energi can it die doe it sleep until find a new energi sourc doe newt feed it with magic is he do research on it consid the last point we can actual build up a stori start back in hogwart ___________________________________________________ the stori of albu dumbledor and newt scamand newt scamand and albu dumbledor had alway been get along veri well and when dumbledor heard of a possibl expel of hi student he of cours want to help yet he knew that thi student would also possibl be abl to help him with a problem he had been keep for year after hi sister had die her obscuru remain he couldn t get himself to tri kill it sinc it wa part of hi sister so he kept it lock away and start to research in order to help those who would be infect in the futur without sucess he couldn t find a solut and then he met newt scamand the young man had an extrodinari talent concern magic creatur and dumbledor found that someon like him could possibl find a solut so when he got expel from hogwart dumbledor offer to make possibl he could keep hi wand but just like with snape he ask someth in return he introduc the young man to hi secret and tragic famili stori and ask him to research on the parasit that had been destroy hi sister for year newt agre and hid it insid hi suitcas to observ and research on it for the follow year of cours thi had to be kept secret so he made up a stori about a girl in sudan that he manag to seper it from and when he talk to credenc he told him the stori of dumbledor sister he never had met _____________________________________________________ thi is the secret that newt ha been keep just like he wa ask to but when will we know for sure i think at one point in the stori newt either open up to someon about the secret or is given verita serum i m certainli look foward to it so what do you think ha newt been keep ariana dumbledor s obscuru leav a comment if you have someth to add thank you veri much for read,"The Obscurus in the suitcase - the truth? (theory (spoiler)) Hi there :)  Before we start this, I have to make a confession: I already made a theory on tumblr on the Obscurus and where Newt could have gotten it from - and completely messed it up concerning the timeline. It’s deleted now.  Today I’m trying again - because I’m still convinced that we haven’t been told the truth about this parasite in Newt’s suitcase. So enjoy :)  ___________________________________________   **Information so far**  When we are introduced to the Obscurus in the movie, we are told it’s a parasite that is created when a young wizard or witch surpresses his magical powers. It feeds on the powers, but when it becomes too strong or when the wizard experiences strong negative emotions, it breaks out, becomes one with the wizard, causes destruction around or kills it’s host.   _______________________________________________________   **Newt’s obscurus**  In the movie, Newt claims to have managed to seperate the obscurus from it’s host, a young girl in Sudan…  Yet when he tells the story to Credence, he suddenly leaves out her heritage and said story starts to sound **identical to Ariana Dumbledore’s**.  It should also be pointed out that when asked what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of him, **he refuses to answer.**  Something is going on here…   __________________________________________________   **Ariana‘s obscurus?**  So… could it be that he is actually been watching over Ariana’s obscurus?  This is where we get to my mistake from the last version of this theory. Ariana died in 1899, when Newt was only two years old.  He never met her in person … but her brother he knew well.  But can an obscurus survive for an unlimited amount of time?   **Really? I can only sum up what we get to see, I can’t wrap my mind around it yet.**   * The Obscurus is said to be unable to survive outside the host - yet when Newt states this, it’s clearly alive and has been for the entire movie… but I think this was just wrong words, he probably meant that it can’t harm anyone outside it’s host. * The Obscurus is said to be a parasite - but it seems to be made out of energy… can it die? Does it sleep until finding a new energy source? Does Newt feed it with magic? Is he doing research on it?  Considering the last point, we can actually build up a story, starting back in Hogwarts.  ___________________________________________________   **The story of Albus Dumbledore and Newt Scamander**  Newt Scamander and Albus Dumbledore had always been getting along very well, and when Dumbledore heard of a possible expelling of his student, he of course wanted to help - yet he knew that this student would also possibly be able to help him with a problem he had been keeping for years…  After his sister had died, her obscurus remained - he couldn’t get himself to try  kill it since it was part of his sister, so he kept it locked away and started to research, in order to help those who would be infected in the future - without sucess.  He couldn’t find a solution … and then he met Newt Scamander  The young man had an extrodinary talent concerning magical creatures, and Dumbledore found that someone like him could possibly find a solution. So, when he got expelled from Hogwarts - Dumbledore offered to make possible he could keep his wand, but just like with Snape - he asked something in return.  He introduced the young man to his secret and tragic family story  - and asked him to research on the parasite that had been destroying his sister for years. Newt agreed, and hid it inside his suitcase, to observe and research on it for the following years.  Of course, this had to be kept secret - so he made up a story about a girl in Sudan, that he managed to seperate it from - and when he talked to Credence, he told him the story of Dumbledores sister he never had met.  _____________________________________________________   This is the secret that Newt has been keeping  just like he was asked to. But when will we know for sure?  I think at one point in the story, Newt either opens up to someone about the secret or is given Verita Serum.  I’m certainly looking foward to it :)  So, what do you think? Has Newt been keeping Ariana Dumbledore’s obscurus? Leave a comment if you have something to add :)  Thank you very much for reading :)"

It still gets me. (I apologize if something similar has already been posted. This subreddit is huge and I suck at searching it.)  Watching Deathly Hallows Part 2 and reimagining the book in my head. Just so I have this straight --- When Harry opens the snitch right before entering the forest clearing, effectively destroying the 2nd to last horcrux (himself), he discovers the Resurrection Stone. So essentially, he is the ultimate master of death in this moment, correct? He had had the invisibility cloak since he was 11, had gained control of the elder wand earlier in Deathly Hallows, and now ""discovered"" the Resurrection Stone (even though he'd technically had it in his possession since early on in Deathly Hallows as well).  The part that gets me, is that he could have walked into the clearing without dropping the Resurrection Stone and been virtually indestructible; however, if he had done that, Voldemort could not have destroyed his own horcrux, which would have made them both ""invincible"", thus fulfilling the prophecy that ""neither could live while the other survives"" because Harry and Voldemort would have no quality of life whatsoever.  Not to mention the fact that Harry was a fucking horcrux the whole time and virtually indestructible to anyone BUT Voldemort, so every time we thought he was in peril there was absolutely NO chance of him actually dying in the first place.  This woman. She beautifully mind fucks me over and over again and the series is going to be 20 years old on June 26. Jesus."

At the beginning of DH they have to disguise Harry by having everyone else take polyjuice potion because he still has the trace on him. But, we learned in OotP that the trace isn’t specific to the wizard - they can tell where magic is happening but not who did it.  Case in point (as explained in OotP) Dobby’s floating cake got pinned on Harry only because he should have been the only wizard/magical creature on privet dr.  But, generally speaking it is up to the parent to ensure that under age wizards are following the rules were not in school.  Therefore, why could Harry not simply apparate to the Weasley‘s house from privet Drive?"

Ok. This has likely been discussed before but I’m curious. I’m watching PoA (my favorite) and the opening scene shows Harry practicing Lumos under his blankets in his bedroom. Not to put too fine a point on it but he is PRACTICING MAGIC outside of school. The next scene we see him blowing up his aunt (well deserved) and he’s well aware of the implications that he’s broken the law for Underage Magic outside of school. How does his earlier use of magic get a pass?

3122,abernathy's path theory spoiler hi there this is a small theory on abernathy s part in tcog and among grindelwald s followers in general and i hope you forgive me for drifting into aberbunty shipping by the end xd enjoy __________________________________________________________________________ the road by the beginning of tcog we learn that abernathy is actually a follower of grindelwald perhaps even was during the incidents of ny he helps him escape and can be seen getting the required skull for his visions with rosier and among the rest of his higher ranked henchmen but more than once doesn t look convinced of what he is doing even nervous frightened first of all i think grindelwald recruited him for a reason since he oversaw a department including the wand permit office and welcomed the european officials who would transfer grindelwald to the old world i d say he s the head of the macusa s department for international magical cooperation not only can grindelwald use someone with experience in this field but also bribe him with the promise of a high rank in his new world maybe even becoming new president of magic of the usa but not just that a golden trophy we saw in the first movie that he is infatuated with queenie so perhaps grindelwald promised him early on that he would in a way make this happen once the war was over i d say it would be in his own interest as well to have a legilimence among his followers and as we know there are ways to jinx someone into agreeing to a relationship this could even lead to a comical scene in fb3 in which queenie who most likely rejected his polite advances in the years leading up to rio actually quite surely confronts him about this plan and about who could live with a jinxed partner which earns her some eyebrows risen beyond the hairline from the rest of the group although she has an out she wasn t going to keep the spell up permanently anyway concerning her aka her being one of the reasons maybe even the greater one why he is a follower of grindelwald we can also go a little further we know he likes her type i d say a broad smile specific facial features a cheerful nature my theory is that he maybe even in the next movie either meets or is told to get in contact with newt s assistant bunty _______________________________________________________________________ the unexpected we don t know if his tounge is still split by the next movie which i wouldn t put past maybe grindelwald conditioned him so much that he wears it proudly as a sacrifice for his master but his muteness could be used to attempt draw her in using her compassion and the fact that she has no problem with silence having worked with animals and because of the beautiful large green eyes a feature he shares with her prior crush i m sure she ll notice them an so eventually something goes wrong he starts falling for her and she never having stepped from the loyalty to both newt and dumbledore helps him to switch sides and eventually asks newt to try and fix his tounge which he agrees to do only for her not having forgotten how abernathy scolded tina in  although he was only doing his job afterwards i think his and bunty s kids could become friends with the ones from the rest of the group but that is much further ahead anyway what do you think anything to add thank you very much for reading,abernathy' path

read,"Abernathy's path (theory) (spoiler) Hi there :)  This is a small theory on Abernathy’s part in TCOG and among Grindelwald’s followers in general - and I hope you forgive me for drifting into Aberbunty-shipping by the end XD Enjoy :)  __________________________________________________________________________   **The road**  By the beginning of TCOG, we learn that Abernathy is actually a follower of Grindelwald (perhaps even was during the incidents of NY). He helps him escape and can be seen getting the required skull for his visions with Rosier and among the rest of his higher-ranked henchmen, but more than once doesn’t look convinced of what he is doing … even nervous, frightened.  First of all, I think Grindelwald recruited him for a reason. Since he oversaw a department including the wand permit office and welcomed the european officials who would transfer Grindelwald to the old world, I’d say he’s the head of the MACUSA’s department for international magical cooperation.  Not only can Grindelwald use someone with experience in this field, but also bribe him with the promise of a high rank in his new world, maybe even becoming new president of magic of the USA… but not just that :)    **A golden trophy**  We saw in the first movie that he is infatuated with Queenie - so perhaps Grindelwald promised him early on that he would, in a way, make this happen once the war was over? I’d say it would be in his own interest as well to have a legilimence among his followers, and, as we know, there are ways to jinx someone into agreeing to a relationship.  This could even lead to a comical scene in FB3, in which Queenie (who most likely rejected his (polite) advances in the years leading up to Rio, actually quite surely) confronts him about this plan, and about who could live with a jinxed partner, which earns her some eyebrows risen beyond the hairline from the rest of the group (although she has an out, she wasn’t going to keep the spell up permanently).  Anyway, concerning her aka her being one of the reasons, maybe even the greater one why he is a follower of Grindelwald, we can also go a little further …  We know he likes her type - I’d say a broad smile, specific facial features, a cheerful nature … my theory is that he, maybe even in the next movie, either meets or is told to get in contact with Newt’s assistant Bunty.   _______________________________________________________________________   **The unexpected**  We don’t know if his tounge is still split by the next movie (which I wouldn’t put past, maybe Grindelwald conditioned him so much that he wears it proudly as a sacrifice for his master) but his muteness could be used to attempt draw her in using her compassion, and the fact that she has no problem with silence (having worked with animals) - and because of the beautiful large green eyes (a feature he shares with her prior crush) … I’m sure she’ll notice them :)  An so, eventually, something goes wrong - he starts falling for her and she, never having stepped from the loyalty to both Newt and Dumbledore, helps him to switch sides and eventually asks Newt to try and fix his tounge (which he agrees to do only for her, not having forgotten how Abernathy scolded Tina in 1926 (although he was only doing his job)).  Afterwards, I think his and Bunty’s kids could become friends with the ones from the rest of the group - but that is much further ahead :)  Anyway, what do you think? Anything to add?  Thank you very much for reading :)"

On mobile my apologies.  Based off what I read in the books it seems as though she considers Hagrid to be next in line to take the title. The reason I believe this is at the end of HBP she calls all heads of house to meet in her office and replaces Snape with Slughorn and also invites Hagrid. Although she never directly mentions the fact that he is to sit in her place as the new head of house it would only make sense as when Dumbledore took the office he replaced himself as head of Gryffindor with Mcgonagall.   What are your guys thoughts and opinions on this subject I couldn't find much discussion in regards to this online.

1520,salazar slytherin could he have been a half blood to start why did the basilisk ever obey tom riddle he was not of pure blood and if slytherin enchanted the basilisk to only obey his true heir why would he have ever accepted a mere half blood as his heir perhaps because secretly he was a half blood himself or maybe he used enchantments that backfired because of a blood status issue whether he was knowingly or ignorantly not of pure blood by that logic the basilisk should have obeyed harry who was every bit of voldemort as diary tom riddle was being both a horcrux and a half blood himself so the basilisk had to have rejected harry based on his ancestry not being of slytherin but of gryffindor rather than his half blood status ginny was of purer blood than harry or tom but for some reason she was the one taken into the chamber which makes no sense besides being the one who was possessed and also to be a precursor to the magic is might philosophy of branding blood traitors such as the weasleys as enemies regardless of heritage moving on diary tom had no way of proving his ancestry to the basilisk the most he could do is like harry and ginny show the basilisk that diary tom is the same tom riddle who commanded the basilisk previously and apparently that was good enough for the basilisk what we really need is an insight to how slytherin himself planned for his heir to take up his legacy the only explanations i could come up with are as follows tom riddle subdued the basilisk himself somehow when he was still in school which was attempting to reject him as the true heir being less than of pure slytherin blood salazar slytherin used enchantments that would allow for a half blood heir to follow in his footsteps perhaps out of paranoia that pure bloods would be slowly bred out of existence but that muggle borns could still be dealt with by a half blood if necessary which turned out to be exactly what was happening being an heir was determined by magical ability to confront a basilisk not by any perceived heritage salazar slytherin enchanted the basilisk to obey a descendant of pure blood but that the enchantment determined what was considered pure slytherin blood based on slytherin s literal own blood which if it was actually half blood would have allowed tom riddle full access to the chamber and control of the basilisk however it could also be that like voldemort and the gaunts salazar had a serious problem with delusions of grandeur and that it manifested itself in this way because salazar slytherin had a lot of influence as a school founder that none of his descendants had again until voldemort raised the death eaters possible yes/no there s holes in why the basilisk behaved the way it did no matter how it s spun the most simple and reasonable being that tom merely subdued it magically rather than passed some sort of test also suspicions and customs change based on time period what made you of pure blood could have been more easily lied about or claimed ignorantly due to lack of record keeping in low population areas or other methods of tracking families such as a census or land ownership it basically almost sounds as though whoever had the most money/land called themselves pure and joined slytherin house when the school was founded probably having a lot of issues proving any of it to slytherin himself but the money was there so party on,salazar slytherin could he have been a half blood to start whi did the basilisk ever obey tom riddl he wa not of pure blood and if slytherin enchant the basilisk to onli

blood? To start, why did the basilisk ever obey Tom Riddle?   -He was not of pure blood, and if Slytherin enchanted the basilisk to only obey his true heir, why would he have ever accepted a mere half-blood as his heir?   Perhaps because, secretly, he was a half blood himself, or maybe he used enchantments that backfired because of a blood-status issue, whether he was knowingly or ignorantly not of pure blood.   -By that logic, the basilisk should have obeyed Harry, who was every bit of Voldemort as Diary Tom Riddle was, being both a Horcrux AND a half-blood himself.  So, the basilisk had to have rejected Harry based on his ancestry not being of Slytherin, but of Gryffindor, rather than his half-blood status.  -Ginny was of purer blood than Harry or Tom, but for some reason, she was the one taken into the Chamber.  Which, makes no sense besides being the one who was possessed, and also to be a precursor to the “Magic is Might” philosophy of branding blood traitors such as the Weasleys as enemies regardless of heritage.  -Moving on, Diary Tom had no way of proving his ancestry to the basilisk, the most he could do is, like Harry and Ginny, show the basilisk that Diary Tom is the same Tom Riddle who commanded the basilisk previously, and apparently that was good enough for the basilisk.  What we really need is an insight to how Slytherin himself planned for his heir to take up his legacy.  The only explanations I could come up with are as follows:  -Tom Riddle subdued the basilisk himself somehow when he was still in school, which was attempting to reject him as the true Heir being less than of pure Slytherin blood.  -Salazar Slytherin used enchantments that would allow for a half blood Heir to follow in his footsteps, perhaps out of paranoia that pure bloods would be slowly bred out of existence, but that muggle borns could still be “dealt with” by a half blood if necessary. (Which turned out to be exactly what was happening)  -Being an “Heir” was determined by magical ability to confront a basilisk, not by any perceived heritage  -Salazar Slytherin enchanted the basilisk to obey a descendant of pure blood, but that the enchantment determined what was considered “pure” Slytherin blood based on Slytherin’s literal own blood, which, if it was actually half blood, would have allowed Tom Riddle full access to the Chamber and control of the basilisk.  However, it could also be that, like Voldemort and the Gaunts, Salazar had a serious problem with delusions of grandeur, and that it manifested itself in this way because Salazar Slytherin had a lot of influence as a school founder that none of his descendants had again until Voldemort raised the Death Eaters.  Possible Yes/No?  There’s holes in why the basilisk behaved the way it did no matter how it’s spun, the most simple and reasonable being that Tom merely subdued it magically rather than passed some sort of “test”.  Also, suspicions and customs change based on time period, what made you of “pure blood” could have been more easily lied about or claimed ignorantly due to lack of record keeping in low population areas, or other methods of tracking families such as a census or land ownership.   It basically almost sounds as though whoever had the most money/land called themselves “pure” and joined Slytherin House when the school was founded, probably having a lot of issues proving any of it to Slytherin himself, but the money was there so...party on?"

3684,the life and truths of gellert grindelwald timeline and proofs about his allegations a lot of people is taking for granted that grindelwald lied to credence about his identity here i am trying to make my point grindelwald didn't lie credence is aurelius albus brother i've already made a post where i theorized aurelius could be percival son conceived after the latter escaped azkaban have a look if you like to https //www reddit com/r/fantasticbeasts/comments/9xe7et/spoilers _theory _some _truth _about _a _character _whom/ https //www reddit com/r/fantasticbeasts/comments/9xe7et/spoilers_theory_some_truth_about_a_character_whom/ some discussions later i have upgraded my theory clarifying some grey areas and coming up with what i think will be revealed in the upcoming movies here it is gellert grindelwald used percival dumledore to conceive aurelius wanting to create a new powerful obscurial wich he witnessed in ariana but couldn't harness due to her dying in the three way duel here's how it went down with dates and everything prior  gellert becomes fascinated with the deathly hallows he is expelled from durmstrang for having made twisted experiments so twisted that even a school pretty tolerant of dark arts doesn't approve he starts thinking about overturning the internation statue of secrecy  june gellert arrives in

how to harness her powers to aid his cause useless without the host fb1  july gellert and albus study the deathly hallows the make a blood pact not to fight each other probably gellert persuaded albus in doing so worried that the latter would later reject the cause and hunt him down  late august gellert tries to convince albus to study and use ariana's obscurus albus isn't sure aberforth discovers gellert plans and confronts him a duel ensue albus can't fight gellert and tries to protect both his brother and friend ariana gets involved in the duel due to her witnessing it and gets killed nobody knows who cast the spell that killed her the dumbledores lose a sister gellert looses an important and rare asset that he really treasured  september gellert visits gregorovitch and steals the elder wand  october  grindelwald having lost ariana does the only thing he can to try and get a new powerful obscurus he breaks into azkaban and either aid percival dumbledore escape or takes from him what he needs to generate a new obscurus he later either imperius him to conceived another son with an unknown woman or just use his semen to impregnate her so twisted experiments  july  anyone aurelius dumbledore is born  aurelius mother ends up loving his son and wants to protect him from grindelwald she ran away with her child planning to hide in usa if percival got out of azkaban he may have aided her and paid with his life  grindelwald looses aurelius and his mother they are aboard a ship to usa that sink aurelius mother dies trying to save his child unbeknown to her his child was swapped with baby corvus lestrange by leta aged  leta was bound to be the cause of his brother death via the prediction of tycho dodonus it is quite safe to say grindelwald investigated the matter and

credence is stated to be born in  in the certificate but this date doesn't add up even if credence is corvus this is an open issue if someone has some explanation i would be eternally grateful  grindelwald hears some rumors about a possible obscurus in new york he knows aurelius is dead he goes to find the obscurial and try to do what he couldn't with ariana he completely overlooks credence because he knows aurelius died and maybe because credence little sister reminds him so much of ariana  after witnessing credence powers grindelwald begins to suspect his true identity and later confirms it by using is magical hookah and/or ordering his followers to investigate on the matter sometime between  and  aurelius is tending to a bird chick that probably appeared in front of him out

himself imagin if rowl drop the bomb of snape love lili year after the last book nobodi would have believ her but it would have still make sens with the canon lt i'm wait for your opinion make my day,"The Life and Truths of Gellert Grindelwald - Timeline and proofs about his allegations A lot of people is taking for granted that Grindelwald lied to Credence about his identity, here I am trying to make my point: Grindelwald didn't lie, Credence is Aurelius, Albus brother.   I've already made a post where I theorized Aurelius could be Percival son, conceived after the latter escaped Azkaban. Have a look if you like to:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xe7et/spoilers\_theory\_some\_truth\_about\_a\_character\_whom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xe7et/spoilers_theory_some_truth_about_a_character_whom/)  Some discussions later, I have upgraded my theory, clarifying some grey areas, and coming up with what I think will be revealed in the upcoming movies. Here it is:  * **Gellert Grindelwald used Percival Dumledore to conceive Aurelius, wanting to create a new powerful obscurial, wich he witnessed in Ariana, but couldn't harness due to her dying in the three way duel.**  Here's how it went down. With dates and everything:  * prior 1899 - Gellert becomes fascinated with the Deathly Hallows. He is expelled from Durmstrang for having made ""twisted experiments"", so twisted that even a school pretty tolerant of Dark Arts doesn't approve. He starts thinking about overturning the Internation Statue of Secrecy. * 1899 (June) - Gellert arrives in Godric Hollows to research the Hallows, befriends the orphan Albus, and discovers Ariana, a powerful obscurial who managed to live past the usual life expectancy of her kin. He immediately starts planning how to harness her powers to aid his cause (""useless without the host"" - FB1). * 1899 (July) - Gellert and Albus study the Deathly Hallows. The make a Blood Pact not to fight each other (probably Gellert persuaded Albus in doing so, worried that the latter would later reject the cause and hunt him down). * 1899 (Late August) - Gellert tries to convince Albus to study and use Ariana's Obscurus. Albus isn't sure. Aberforth discovers Gellert plans and confronts him: a duel ensue. Albus can't fight Gellert, and tries to protect both his brother and friend. Ariana gets involved in the duel (due to her witnessing it) and gets killed (nobody knows who cast the spell that killed her). The Dumbledores lose a sister, Gellert looses an important and rare asset that he really treasured. * 1899 (September?) - Gellert visits Gregorovitch and steals the Elder Wand. * 1899 (October 31?) - Grindelwald, having lost Ariana, does the only thing he can to try and get a new powerful Obscurus: he breaks into Azkaban and either aid Percival Dumbledore escape or takes from him what he needs to generate a new Obscurus. He later either imperius him to conceived another son with an unknown woman, or just use his semen to impregnate her (so ""twisted"" experiments). * 1900 (July 31, anyone?) - Aurelius Dumbledore is born. * 1901 - Aurelius mother ends up loving his son, and wants to protect him from Grindelwald. She ran away with her child, planning to hide in USA. If Percival got out of Azkaban he may have aided her, and paid with his life. * 1901 - Grindelwald looses Aurelius and his mother. They are aboard a ship to USA that sink. Aurelius mother dies trying to save his child. Unbeknown to her, his child was swapped with baby Corvus Lestrange by Leta (aged 5/6). Leta was bound to be the cause of his brother death via The Prediction of Tycho Dodonus. It is quite safe to say Grindelwald investigated the matter and also presumed Aurelius to be dead. * 1905 - Aurelius Dumbledore gets adopted by MaryLou Barebone under the name of Credence Barebone. Credence was a false identity originally conceived to hide Corvus Lestrange. (Credence is stated to be born in 1904 in the certificate, but this date doesn't add up, even if Credence is Corvus. This is an open issue, if someone has some explanation, I would be eternally grateful). * 1926 - Grindelwald hears some rumors about a possible Obscurus in New York. He knows Aurelius is dead, he goes to find the obscurial and try to do what he couldn't with Ariana. He completely overlooks Credence, because he knows Aurelius died, and maybe because Credence little sister reminds him so much of Ariana. * 1926 - After witnessing Credence powers, Grindelwald begins to suspect his true identity, and later confirms it by using is magical hookah and/or ordering his followers to investigate on the matter. * Sometime between 1926 and 1927 - Aurelius is tending to a bird chick (that probably appeared in front of him out of nowhere in a burst of flames). It is Fawkes, the Phoenix Guardian of the Dumbledores, passed down from father to son: an unbeatable evidence of Credence true lineage.  Find me a hole in this, I challenge you! It's amazing how it all fell togheter almost by itself when I looked at dates and facts.  Some criticism you might want to bring out:  * No one ever escaped Azkaban before Sirius Black! -&gt; &gt;!That is prooven wrong in canon, remember Barty Crouch Jr?!&lt; * Kendra/Ariana is Aurelius mother! -&gt; &gt;!We see two children in the ship, both seemingly less then 1yr old. Even if the ship sunk Jan-1-1901 Aurelius would have been born in early 1900, and we know that Ariana and Kendra were dead by that time.!&lt; * Credence has Ariana Obscurus inside him -&gt; &gt;!Please show me some theory to support that that isn't ""I don't want to believe Aurelius is Albus brother"". My theory is far more logical, and has to do just with character motivations, no magical technicality here!!&lt; * So all this happend by chance? What a coincidence Leta swapped his brother for Aurelius -&gt;&gt;! What a coincidence both Harry and Neville were born in late July, by families who had three times defied Voldemort: I could go on with coincidences in original saga the we know and love!!&lt; * Why nobody mentioned Aurelius in the original saga? -&gt;&gt;! People have their reason to keep secrets, and the Dumbledores surely have history in keeping secrets! I'm confident in the next movies: we will see how events will go down, and we will be given a valid reason on why Albus never mentioned fighting or saving his brother Aurelius. That is required for JK, or else she'll face the rage of the fandom. Remember that Albus never told about Snape to Harry. Harry would have never knew if not for Snape himself! Imagine if Rowling dropped the bomb of Snape loving Lily years after the last book: nobody would have believed her, but it would have still make sense with the canon.!&lt;  I'm waiting for your opinions... make my day!  & #   & #   & #   & #"

It really seems different enough so far to not feel like another Hogwarts.

They had clothes that looked like it was from another generation but also kind of eccentric. I'm not saying everyone should  be in robes but their clothes should have some flare. Just look at Gilderoy Lockhart, Mad-eye Moody or Rita Skeeter!  A lot of the guys in COG looked like Peaky Blinders or just wore plane boring suits, I think that's why I couldn't see Jude Law as a young Dumbledore. He just looked like a guy and didn't really give off the vibe of the person we know he's going to become. It's a shame because simply putting some more effort into the wardrobes could have made such a big impact.  Now I think about it, all the Auror's in the first fantastic beasts all just wore matching leather trench coats and fedora's which was equally boring."

He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.   ""Thank you very much, Professor.""   ""You’re a good boy,"" said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus moustache. ""**And you’ve got her eyes**... just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it ...""   And he, too, put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.  ≠=================  ***Deathly Hallows Chapter 32: 'The Elder Wand'***   A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issue from Snape’s throat.    “Take… it… Take… it…”   Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do —   A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grab on Harry’s robes slackened.   “Look… at… me…” he whispered.   **The green eyes found the black**, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more."

(Gift for girlfriend) So I’m buying my girlfriend a custom champagne glass set.  I got an amazing artist to draw up her initials.  For the A I can’t pick between the two designs..  I’ve seen the movies, but haven’t read all the books yet..  Issue: The artist put in the deathly hallows symbol, but as you can see, it’s elongated.  But it’s tall and skinny which is perfect for a champagne glass. Do you think it’s a big deal if the symbol is elongated like that? Does the book reference it to being a perfect triangle with even sides? Or should I go with the second option..?  Also does anyone think the right side of the A is too thick?  Just curious on opinions!  Thank you Reddit!  https://imgur.com/a/N35XPHi"

He was powerful, demented, and extremely selfish. He treats his followers terribly, and all who join him, fear him and seek to please him out of that fear. And in a villain, those things are intimidating and awful, but not terrifying or lasting.  Grindelwald is power hungry, sure, but he is fighting for a greater purpose and has a plan to remake the world. We know he is capable of love and friendship, and he treats his followers and potential followers as a family. His lies are subtle, his methods thought out, clever, and meticulous. He does not rule in power, but in building a movement. The only ones who fear him are those who directly oppose him.   I would make the argument, that Voldemort is a inferior villain to Grindlewald. And while Voldemort’s reign of terror was awful, the ideas that Grindlewald championed outlasted him and his followers.   This is why when Grindlewald taunts Voldemort in the Book, you get a sense of how small Voldemort is as a man. Grindlewald goes to his death with confidence and cleverness, while Voldemort is terrified of it.  I hope we get this scene again at the end of the FB films. Because it was a throw away scene in the 7th movie."

As far as I can recall, Harry's defense hinged on the fact that there were Dementors threatening his life, and so he had to cast a Patronus charm to save his life. Magic is allowed to be used in front of Muggles in the case of a life-threatening situation, so Harry's usage was legal.  Ok, great, but in order for Harry's life to be threatened, there needs to be Dementors showing up at his doorstep. The only reason Dementors would show up in Harry's muggle town is if they're outside Ministry control. But the Ministry holds the official position that no Dementors are outside their control.  So how exactly does Harry get off here? The only way would be if the Ministry concedes that there are Dementors outside of their control. And as far as I can recall, they never conceded such a point. But if this was the only way Harry could get off, shouldn't he have not gotten off? How exactly did he get off, if the Ministry officially believes that there were no Dementors present and so no life-threatening situation existed that necessitated the casting of the patronus?"

I'm strictly adhering to this.   & #   Snapes patronus is a doe, because he loved lily. However, wouldn't her death would erase Snapes connection to the patronus- he has no hope to be with her or talk to her, there is no happiness because she is dead and he unwittingly brought that about himself – so what would be his desire to survive? Can we assume his “love for lily is so strong it surpasses his grief”? This love is his happiness.   But this brings me to Fred and George. It’s said that after Fred dies, George can never cast a patronus. Why not? He has grief that he lost his brother, but why does this love not transcend in the way that Snapes does?   Snape never even spent that much time with lily, more of an ideal he had of her – maybe this is why he can still cast one?   Because though she died, he never knew the real her. The lily that lives on with snape that allows him to cast a patronus is an image of her he made up  & #   This disconnect bothers me - any ideas?"

A fourth possibility that I havent heard anyone mention is that maybe the Dumbledore connection for the Phoenix is with Grindlewald.

That's the mark of a true Gryffindor, right there. In fact, it's still debated if she did survive or not.  But beyond that, I get the impression that she's just really **really** nice. I know some people almost instinctively see her as a mean girl stereotype, but I always liked how in the background, she kept looking out for Trelawney. And even though Ron found her a bit much to handle, she probably did more good for his self esteem than anyone else did at that point.   It just seems unfair to me that she's so heavily slammed by some people for being in love. Besides, she may be over the top, but she's so endearing that I can't help but smile whenever she shows up. Quadruply so in the HBP movie, because Jessie Cave's performance simply couldn't be any cuter.  Idk, I just feel like showing Lav-Lav some appreciation."

I disagree. I think that, while it is showing the past, it's also showing dumbledores deepest desire. Although he loved grindlewald, he knows he has to be the one to take him down and knowing Dumbledore, he's probably feeling very guilty about everything happening and how he can't stop it. What he wants more than anything at that time is to have not made the blood pact. While obviously the mirror shows him making the pact, I think this was possibly just an easier way to portray the thought to the big screen. Not much more to back this up than just a gut feeling/reaction to what I saw. Curious to know if anyone else felt this way!"

There's no better place to start than reading about Jo herself, and so far it's been incredibly fascinating and engaging. Since 2001 I've read all the books, seen all the films multiple times and been in love with this ever-expanding world, and speaking of which, here's my aforementioned theory:  Jo spent time in Paris for a year of study, and Portugal as an interpreter in the early 90s...so perhaps, just maybe, Jo may take the opportunity of the Fantastic Beasts films to revisit some of the places she's been to, or even places she's always wanted to visit!  TLR: Jo's known travel history (the places she's been, or has expressed interest in) \*may\* give us clues as to where the third, fourth and fifth film will take place/visit.   Looking forward to your thoughts!"

Frankly, they are all more believable than trying to believe that 67 year old Maggie Smith was supposed to be a 56 year old witch (her age at time of Sorcerers Stone).  Don't get me wrong, there is no one better on this planet than Maggie Smith for that role.  Richard Harris (71) was playing a 110 year old Dumbledore.  I know there is the one post in Pottermore saying she grew up in the early 1900's, but even if she was born in the 1890's she would still be growing up in the early 1900's. I was born in the 80's but grew up in the 90's."

life and imagine a better one she even creates an imaginary friend when shes lonely katie but she also holds grudges with people while most hufflepuffs are excepting of everyone sometimes to a fault

trouble so much in fact her character arc in the first book is to learn to let go that holding grudges can lead to guilt and regret shes also stubborn which goes hand in hand with holding grudges but i still feel as though with all her other traits that fit in to other houses she doesn't scream gryffinndor her talkative nature especially isn't very gryffindor the last house she could fit into is

I really enjoyed it. Sure, there's a pretty substantial timeline gaffe, but Marcus Flint had 8 years at Hogwarts, so I'm not too fussed. I think people are just too used to Marvel films that all play into some bigger story but each installment is also it's own separate story, whereas Fantastic Beasts is one story spread out over 5 movies. If you're on the fence about seeing it, ignore the reviews. You'll have a good time."

But the other horcruxes (exclude Nagini for now) were destroyed using the sword or basilisk fangs. Now, I use “destroyed” loosely, because the object themselves can still serve their original purpose (the locket and ring can still be worn, the diary can still be written in, etc.) But Nagini was the only other living horcrux other than Harry, and Neville literally decapitates her, so she can’t come back to life. Harry however was hit with the Killing Curse, which kills but doesn’t do any physical harm to Harry himself. So when the horcrux was destroyed, Harry still came back to life. If Voldemort just used the spell he used to kill Snape or just used a sword or something that causes the victim to bleed out and die on Harry, he wouldn’t have lived. I know the real reason he survived was more than that, Harry’s blood in Voldemort and all that stuff. But do you really think Harry would’ve survived even with his blood in Voldemort if Voldemort just decapitated him or just bled him to death? I think this is one way Harry would’ve died even with Lily’s protection."

He forgot to press the knot that immobilize the tree  and took a HUGE branch to the groin. Because of this, Harry was actually conceived by Lily and a house elf named Foggy.  Foggy was the Potter's house-elf and was given to James and Lily as a wedding gift. Anyways, house-elves can make their own version of polyjuice potion, and that's exactly what James and Lily had him do. Lily vigorously rode Foggy transformed as James (although she wouldn't kiss him on the mouth), until his seed was spilled and planted deep. That's why Harry has green eyes (Lily), untidy jet black hair (James), and of course his knobbly knees (Foggy).  Naturally, James and Lily wanted this kept secret so the last command given to Foggy was to disapparate to the Black Lake and to feed himself to the giant squid. After that day, Foggy was never mentioned again. Even their closest friends and family never knew, and when his disappearance was brought up, James and Lily would lie and say they set Foggy free.  & #   I asked JK Rowling and she confirmed this to be true."
938,theory on the sorting hat and prophecies so i've recently been listening to the harry potter audio books after first reading the books  years ago i've also been rewatching the films and reading this sub and it's gotten me thinking i know there has previously been discussion on how the sorting hat knows which house to sort you in e g on your values but most of what we know from the sorting hat is from what it tells us in it's songs ' ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me ' 'there s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can t see' ' i sort you into houses because that is what i m for but this year i ll go further ' so from the above we know the sorting hat is very clever or thinks it is can see everything inside your head and can prophesise the further if you consider its warning a prophecy so my theory is that the sorting hat sorts you into the house that matches your life's most defining action it can see in your head your potential future life sees your most defining action and which quality this is and creates a self fulfilling prophecy by sorting you into that house and making you therefore value that quality the most for example i believe the most defining moment in neville's life is killing nagini and this showed bravery snape you could argue was really a brave hero so why wasn't he in gryffindor he only switched to the 'good' side for his own selfish reasons and creepy love of lily it wasn't out of true bravery or loyalty james in gryffindor even tho we was a bit of an arrogant wanker at school his defining moment was being brave standing up to voldemort peter in gryffindor as his defining moment was helping harry draco in slytherin as his defining moment was in my opinion his actions in hbp as his family regaining status is his main motivation your teenage years are some of your most important for brain development so i think as being in your hogwarts house becomes such a large part of your identity in these years the qualities associated with your house define you we've seen self fulfilling prophecies before with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which voldemort fulfils by hearing it and trying to kill harry and you could argue many events wouldn't have been able to happen if the hat hadn't sorted students the way it had e g if hermione had been sorted into ravenclaw would harry and ron been able to defeat voldemort also the maurders being sorted together death eaters being sorted together etc to take it a bit further i believe the sorting hat considered putting harry in slytherin partly because of voldermort's soul fragment but also because it could see harry owning all  of the hallows and it had to decide whether harry would use this selfishly to take power or if he would use them for good once harry asked to be in gryffindor the sorting hat knew harry would use the hallows for good i also have another theory that harry is the only true owner of the elder wand that could potentially overcome the whole wandlore slight plot hole thing so in conclusion i believe the sorting hat has divination powers and creates a self fulfilling prophecy for each student based on the most important action of their life of course this sometimes fails and a student goes against their 'destiny' such as regulus black however for most students their house quality will become a major part of their identity therefore shaping their lives and futures,theori on the sort hat and propheci so i'v recent been listen to the harri potter audio book after first read the book  year ago i'v also been rewatch the film and read thi sub and it' gotten me think i know there ha previous been discuss on how the sort hat know which hous to sort you in e g on your valu but most of what we know from the sort hat is from what it tell us in it' song ' ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me ' 'there s noth hidden in your head the sort hat can t see' ' i sort you into hous becaus that is what i m for but thi year i ll go further ' so from the abov we know the sort hat is veri clever or think it is can see everyth insid your head and can prophesis the further if you consid it warn a propheci so my theori is that the sort hat sort you into the hous that match your life' most defin action it can see in your head your potenti futur life see your most defin action and which qualiti thi is and creat a self fulfil propheci by sort you into that hous and make you therefor valu that qualiti the most for exampl i believ the most defin moment in neville' life is kill nagini and thi show braveri snape you could argu wa realli a brave hero so whi wasn't he in gryffindor he onli switch to the 'good' side for hi own selfish reason and creepi love of lili it wasn't out of true braveri or loyalti jame in gryffindor even tho we wa a bit of an arrog wanker at school hi defin moment wa be brave stand up to voldemort peter in gryffindor as hi defin moment wa help harri draco in slytherin as hi defin moment wa in my opinion hi action in hbp as hi famili regain statu is hi main motiv your teenag year are some of your most import for brain develop so i think as be in your hogwart hous becom such a larg part of your ident in these year the qualiti associ with your hous defin you we'v seen self fulfil propheci befor with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which voldemort fulfil by hear it and tri to kill harri and you could argu mani event wouldn't have been abl to happen if the hat hadn't sort student the way it had e g if hermion had been sort into ravenclaw would harri and ron been abl to defeat voldemort also the maurder be sort togeth death eater be sort togeth etc to take it a bit further i believ the sort hat consid put harri in slytherin partli becaus of voldermort' soul fragment but also becaus it could see harri own all  of the hallow and it had to decid whether harri would use thi selfishli to take power or if he would use them for good onc harri ask to be in gryffindor the sort hat knew harri would use the hallow for good i also have anoth theori that harri is the onli true owner of the elder wand that could potenti overcom the whole wandlor slight plot hole thing so in conclus i believ the sort hat ha divin power and creat a self fulfil propheci for each student base on the most import action of their life of cours thi sometim fail and a student goe against their 'destiny' such as regulu black howev for most student their hous qualiti will becom a major part of their ident therefor shape their live and futur,theori on the sort hat and propheci so i'v recent been listen to the harri potter audio book after first read the book  year ago i'v also been rewatch the film and read thi sub and it'

you into the hous that match your life' most defin action it can see in your head your potenti futur life see your most defin action and which qualiti thi is and creat a self fulfil propheci by sort you into that hous and make you therefor valu that qualiti the most for exampl i believ the most defin moment in neville' life is kill nagini and thi show braveri snape you could argu wa realli a brave hero so whi wasn't he in gryffindor he onli switch to the 'good' side for hi own selfish reason and creepi love of lili it wasn't out of true braveri or loyalti jame in gryffindor even tho we wa a bit of an arrog wanker at school hi defin moment wa be brave stand up to voldemort peter in gryffindor as hi defin moment wa help harri draco in slytherin as hi defin moment wa in my opinion hi action in hbp as hi famili regain statu is hi main motiv your teenag year are some of your most import for brain develop so i think as be in your hogwart hous becom such a larg part of your ident in these year the qualiti associ with your hous defin you we'v seen self fulfil propheci befor with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which voldemort fulfil by hear it and tri to kill harri and you could argu mani event wouldn't have been abl to happen if the hat hadn't sort student the way it had e g if hermion had been sort into ravenclaw would harri and ron been abl to defeat voldemort also the maurder be sort togeth death eater be sort togeth etc to take it a bit further i believ the sort hat consid put harri in slytherin partli becaus of voldermort' soul fragment but also becaus it could see harri own all  of the hallow and it had to decid whether harri would use thi selfishli to take power or if he would use them for good onc harri ask to be in gryffindor the sort hat knew harri would use the hallow for good i also have anoth theori that harri is the onli true owner of the elder wand that could potenti overcom the whole wandlor slight plot hole thing so in conclus i believ the sort hat ha divin power and creat a self fulfil propheci for each student base on the most import action of their life of cours thi sometim fail and a student goe against their 'destiny' such as regulu black howev for most student their hous qualiti will becom a major part of their ident therefor shape their live and futur,"Theory on the Sorting Hat and Prophecies So i've recently been listening to the Harry Potter audio books after first reading the books 8 years ago. I've also been rewatching the films and reading this sub and it's gotten me thinking...  & #   I know there has previously been discussion on how the Sorting Hat knows which house to sort you in e.g. on your values. But most of what we know from the sorting hat is from what it tells us in it's songs:  '*’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.'*  *'There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see'*  '*I sort you into Houses Because that is what I’m for, But this year I’ll go further,'*  So from the above we know the Sorting Hat is very clever (or thinks it is), can see everything inside your head and can prophesise the further (if you consider its warning a prophecy).  So my theory is that the Sorting Hat sorts you into the house that matches your life's most defining action.  It can see in your head your potential future life, sees your most defining action and which quality this is and creates a self fulfilling prophecy by sorting you into that house and making you therefore value that quality the most.  For example, I believe the most defining moment in Neville's life is killing Nagini, and this showed bravery.  Snape you could argue was really a brave hero so why wasn't he in Gryffindor? He only switched to the 'good' side for his own selfish reasons and creepy love of Lily. It wasn't out of true bravery or loyalty  James in Gryffindor even tho we was a bit of an arrogant wanker at school? His defining moment was being brave standing up to Voldemort.  Peter in Gryffindor as his defining moment was helping Harry.  Draco in Slytherin as his defining moment was, in my opinion, his actions in HBP, as his family regaining status is his main motivation.  Your teenage years are some of your most important for brain development so I think as being in your Hogwarts House becomes such a large part of your identity in these years the qualities associated with your house define you.  We've seen self fulfilling prophecies before with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which Voldemort fulfils by hearing it and trying to kill Harry.  And you could argue many events wouldn't have been able to happen if the hat hadn't sorted students the way it had. E.g. if Hermione had been sorted into Ravenclaw would Harry and Ron been able to defeat Voldemort? Also the maurders being sorted together, death eaters being sorted together etc.  To take it a bit further I believe the Sorting Hat considered putting Harry in Slytherin partly because of Voldermort's soul fragment, but also because it could see Harry owning all 3 of the Hallows, and it had to decide whether Harry would use this selfishly to take power, or if he would use them for good. Once Harry asked to be in Gryffindor the sorting hat knew Harry would use the Hallows for good (I also have another theory that Harry is the only true owner of the Elder Wand that could potentially overcome the whole Wandlore slight plot hole thing)  So in conclusion I believe the Sorting Hat has divination powers and creates a self fulfilling prophecy for each student based on the most important action of their life. Of course this sometimes fails and a student goes against their 'destiny' such as Regulus Black, however for most students their house quality will become a major part of their identity therefore shaping their lives and futures."

The crew is standing in front of hogwarts while Newt talks with dumbledore. But as we learn in the original movies, No-Magic People cannot see hogwarts. So Jacob is standing there in front of Hogwarts, a breathtaking view, but nobody bothers to give him a spell or something so he can ACTUALLY see that they are not in the middle of nowhere.  & #   I would have much rather enjoyed the scene if they go there, and we see thesame scenerie that Jacob sees. nothing. And then they reveal it for him and the viewers., The bridge, the towers etc.  & #   Also, is Newt just dissapearing in front of his eyes or is he walking in the air?"

The one talked about plot of CoG has been that the Elder Wand should have resisted Grindelwald because it supposedly belongs to Tina since she summoned the wand at the end of the first film.  In my opinion, this isn't a plot hole at all. And I think there are two reasons for it.  First, at the end of the first film, Grindelwald wasn't disarmed. By anyone. He simply dropped his wand. Here is an excerpt from the script:  &gt;  Out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around Graves like a whip. Graves tries to hold it off as it tightens, but staggers, struggles, and falls to his knees, dropping his wand. &gt;  &gt; TINA  &gt; *Accio.*  And second, Tina merely summoned the wand. She doesn't disarm Grindelwald with the Expelliarmus spell, which we know transfers the allegiance of a wand to the caster of the spell.  It's been some years since I read the books and I'm not that knowledgeable on Potter lore, but I don't think simply summoning a wand makes you its master.  The movie did have its flaws, sure, but I don't think this was one of them.  What are your thoughts?"

3177,theory of how dumbledore defeats grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that grindelwald has the elder wand so that everyone understand first off we must remember that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to change allegiance grindelwald stunned gregoravich while he had the wand either the stunning spell made the allegiance change or the stealing did both show that the original owner doesn't need to be in possession of it this is also true of harry forcing draco's wand off him the elder wand being in dumbledores tomb at the time which was in allegiance of draco at that point which then changes allegiance to harry what i believe is that newt is now the true owner after defeating grindelwald in the subway with his pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below with a sense that he s been holding this one back he slashes it through the air out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around graves like a whip graves tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers struggles and falls to his knees dropping his wand this would be a clear act of defeating grindelwald bound and disarmed regardless if grindelwald dropped it of his own accord if he did then it's a sign of giving up and defeat more so then it being disarmed from him grindelwald will be able to use the wand as normal when he receives it back but it will not act like an unbeatable wand for him with the knowledge of the last movie having the blood pact and the theory that they cannot harm eachother which leads to the theory of arianas death being a spell rebounding off one of them then hitting her instead due to the blood pact not letting them harm eachother this is from another theory of how the blood pact works by not allowing them to hit eachother with spells which ties in with how a spell would of ricocheted and hit ariana instead the same may happen again dumbledore may send a disarming spell and it rebounds off grindelwald and hits newt without meaning to which would then cause dumbledore to be the true owner then recognising that it's now attacking his master causes the next spell that grindelwald casts to rebound back at grindelwald which does not go against the conditions of the bloodpact which then defeats him possibly a disarming spell since grindelwald doesn't die which then causes the wand to fly up and dumbledore then takes possession of and ultimately defeats grindelwald,theori of how dumbledor defeat grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that grindelwald ha the elder wand so that everyon understand first off we must rememb that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to chang allegi grindelwald stun gregoravich while he had the wand either the stun spell made the allegi chang or the steal did both show that the origin owner doesn't need to be in possess of it thi is also true of harri forc draco' wand off him the elder wand be in dumbledor tomb at the time which wa in allegi of draco at that point which then chang allegi to harri what i believ is that newt is now the true owner after defeat grindelwald in the subway with hi pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below with a sens that he s been hold thi one back he slash it through the air out fli a crackl rope of supernatur light that wrap itself around grave like a whip grave tri to hold it off as it tighten but stagger struggl and fall to hi knee drop hi wand thi would be a clear act of defeat grindelwald bound and disarm regardless if grindelwald drop it of hi own accord if he did then it' a sign of give up and defeat more so then it be disarm from him grindelwald will be abl to use the wand as normal when he receiv it back but it will not act like an unbeat wand for him with the knowledg of the last movi have the blood pact and the theori that they cannot harm eachoth which lead to the theori of ariana death be a spell rebound off one of them then hit her instead due to the blood pact not let them harm eachoth thi is from anoth theori of how the blood pact work by not allow them to hit eachoth with spell which tie in with how a spell would of ricochet and hit ariana instead the same may happen again dumbledor may send a disarm spell and it rebound off grindelwald and hit newt without mean to which would then caus dumbledor to be the true owner then recognis that it' now attack hi master caus the next spell that grindelwald cast to rebound back at grindelwald which doe not go against the condit of the bloodpact which then defeat him possibl a disarm spell sinc grindelwald doesn't die which then caus the wand to fli up and dumbledor then take possess of and ultim defeat grindelwald,theori of how dumbledor defeat grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that grindelwald ha the elder wand so that everyon understand first off we must rememb that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to chang

defeat grindelwald,"Theory of how Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that Grindelwald has the elder wand. So that everyone understand first off we must remember that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to change allegiance, Grindelwald stunned Gregoravich while he had the wand. Either the stunning spell made the allegiance change or the stealing did, both show that the original owner doesn't need to be in possession of it.  This is also true of Harry forcing Draco's wand off him, the elder wand being in Dumbledores tomb at the time which was in allegiance of Draco at that point, which then changes allegiance to Harry.  What I believe is that Newt is now the true owner after defeating grindelwald in the subway with his pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below:  ""With a sense that he’s been holding this one back, he slashes it through the air: out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around GRAVES like a whip. GRAVES tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers, struggles and falls to his knees, dropping his wand.""  This would be a clear act of defeating Grindelwald, bound and disarmed, regardless if Grindelwald dropped it of his own accord, if he did then it's a sign of giving up and defeat more so then it being ""disarmed"" from him.  Grindelwald will be able to use the wand as normal when he receives it back but it will not act like an unbeatable wand for him.   With the knowledge of the last movie having the blood pact and the theory that they cannot harm eachother which leads to the theory of Arianas death being a spell rebounding off one of them then hitting her instead due to the blood pact not letting them harm eachother (this is from another theory of how the blood pact works by not allowing them to hit eachother with spells which ties in with how a spell would of ricocheted and hit ariana instead), the same may happen again.   Dumbledore may send a disarming spell and it rebounds off Grindelwald and hits Newt without meaning to which would then cause Dumbledore to be the true owner, then recognising that it's now attacking his master, causes the next spell that Grindelwald casts to rebound back at Grindelwald which does not go against the conditions of the bloodpact, which then defeats him, possibly a disarming spell since Grindelwald doesn't die which then causes the wand to fly up and Dumbledore then takes possession of and ultimately defeats Grindelwald."

But what I love is that it isn't a story about ""that autistic character.""  It isn't a big ""thing."" It just is. And that's the kind of representation that I think does the most good sometimes."

Presumably boarding school, but they're expensive and relatively few would be able to use that excuse realistically.  2. What about local councils/education authorities who are supposed to keep track on where every child is educated? Are the kids removed from their records by a team at the Ministry? 3. Do students in Hogwarts keep in touch with any of their Muggle friends during the holidays? Or if you go to Hogwarts, you cut off all contact?

To add insult to injury, his pet rat of 12 years knocked him out cold with his own wand, meaning Ron never played a key part in rescuing Sirious and he never got to experience time traveling.  Goblet of Fire - Not even mentioning his absenteeism during one of the most tumultuos times of Harry's life, Ron again needs saving when McGonagall and Dumbledore bewitch him, Hermoine, Cho and Fleur's sister during the 2nd task of the Triwizard Tournament.  Order of the Phoenix - One of the Death Eaters hits Ron with a curse in the Ministry of Magic which causes him to become mentally unstable and unaware of his surroundings. He becomes another cause of worry for Harry when the brain attacks Ron and he has to draw the Death Eaters away from him by running alone with the prophecy.  Half Blood Prince - Ron decides to eat a dozen cauldron cakes for breakfast which causes Harry to need to rescue him from the effects of Romilda Vane's love potion. Then he nearly dies from the poisoned mead in Slughorn's office and Harry again needs to save his life with the bezoar.  Deathly Hallows - Godric's Hollow. 'Nuff said."

3607,this movie needs a director s cut it s quite obvious i don t know if it was like a full hour longer initially but it seems like the movie jumps from scene to scene without a proper connection between them and it does it constantly it s specially evident when they go from the archives to the cemetery they have barely finished with the creepy cats and suddenly they re in a different location like nothing happened the whole edit is filled with quick jumps and the pace of the movie suffers from that also there re like  or  different scenes that were shown in the trailer and didn t make it in the final cut scenes that would probably add a lot to the whole story i don t know if it s possible but i think this particular movie would be greatly improved by a director s cut version when it comes out on bluray,thi movi need a director s cut it s quit obviou i don t know if it wa like a full hour longer initi but it seem like the movi jump from scene to scene without a proper connect between them and it doe it constantli it s special evid when they go from the archiv to the cemeteri they have bare finish with the creepi cat and suddenli they re in a differ locat like noth happen the whole edit is fill with quick jump and the pace of the movi suffer from that also there re like  or  differ scene that were shown in the trailer and didn t make it in the final cut scene that would probabl add a lot to the whole stori i don t know if it s possibl but i think thi particular movi would be greatli improv by a director s cut version when it come out on bluray,thi movi need a director s cut it s quit obviou i don t know if it wa like a full hour longer initi but it seem like the movi jump from scene to scene without a proper connect between them and it doe it constantli it s special evid when they go from the archiv to the cemeteri they have bare finish with the creepi cat and suddenli they re in a differ locat like noth happen the whole edit is fill with quick jump and the pace of the movi suffer from that also there re like  or  differ scene that were shown in the trailer and didn t make it in the final cut scene that would probabl add a lot to the whole stori i don t know if it s possibl but i think thi particular movi would be greatli improv by a director s cut version when it come out on bluray,"This movie needs a Director’s Cut It’s quite obvious. I don’t know if it was like a full hour longer initially, but it seems like the movie jumps from scene to scene without a proper connection between them, and it does it constantly. It’s specially evident when they go from the archives to the cemetery. They have barely finished with the creepy cats and suddenly they’re in a different location like nothing happened. The whole edit is filled with quick jumps and the pace of the movie suffers from that.  Also, there’re like 4 or 5 different scenes that were shown in the trailer and didn’t make it in the final cut. Scenes that would probably add a lot to the whole story.  I don’t know if it’s possible, but I think this particular movie would be greatly improved by a director’s cut version when it comes out on bluray."

I think it’s a bit of a odd choice when it prevents people speculating romance outcomes and it confirmed they can’t die either before they have at least one child (Newt having grandson was revealed much before even). Did Rowling actually want less attention on romance speculation to the focus be elsewhere or why do you think she shared this info?

That movie was so over complicated and confusing. I loved the magic, cinematography and characters. Even the acting was solid but the plot was burdened by so DAMN much. They needed to cut some out and spend that additional time explaining the plot and character motivations. I hope Fantastic Beats doesn't become JK Rowling's Star Wars prequels. She is a great story teller and world builder but she needs experienced screenwriters and filmic storytellers to reshape her vision for the screen. I could easily see Crimes of Grindelwald being a 600 page JK Rowling novel that was crammed into two hours. I'm so pissed, I loved everything about it except the bloated and complicated plot. PLEASE JK and Warner Brothers, listen to the critics and fix this for the next film. (Also, don't have Queenie just come back to the good side again...she made her bed, make her sleep in it and build a character we love into a conflicted evil character to the end!)"

2698,grindelwald is a good guy now this might seem like a huge what no scenario given he is clearly made to be the antagonist who stands in opposition to our protagonists but what is grindelwald s actually message and are we ever truly given anything that makes sense to counter this grindelwald wants wizards to run society both muggle no maj but that name is terrible and wizard and you might think this is bad and totally unfair and yes that s we were all told to think through the harry potter series voldemort left a bad taste in our mouths but there is a clear difference between the voldemort agenda and the grindelwald agenda while voldemort wishes for a grand genocide of what he deems blood filth grindelwald does not quite to the contrary he wants non magical people to just have a different role in society and we can say oh that role means something horrible but can we say that he has yet to explain more on this future muggle role in a wizard run society the only reason we even think it will be a bad role in society is because we think he is the antagonist and all antagonists have bad agendas and more so when have we ever seen a competent muggle at all in the harry potter series or lore from all evidence wizards are basically superior beings to muggles with literal power of magic on their sides what evidence is there to let us confidently say we should let from all given evidence in lore incompetent and arguably lesser beings then wizards muggles run a part of our society another point grindelwald brings up is that from his agenda so far he seems to want to bring muggles and wizards into a shared society which is something all wizard governing bodies oppose wizards have the capacity with their magic to alleviate so much pain sickness labor and slow progression of societal building with their magic there is no disputing this grindelwald while he might have some flawed methodology and enactment of his political and society agenda has by far a good

you guy thought,"Grindelwald is a good guy Now this might seem like a huge “What no!” scenario, given he is clearly made to be the antagonist who stands in opposition to our protagonists. But what is Grindelwald’s actually message, and are we ever truly given anything that makes sense to counter this? Grindelwald wants wizards to run society, both muggle (no-maj but that name is terrible) and wizard. And you might think this is bad, and totally unfair, and yes, that’s we were all told to think through the Harry Potter series (Voldemort left a bad taste in our mouths). But there is a clear difference between the Voldemort agenda and the Grindelwald agenda. While Voldemort wishes for a grand genocide of what he deems blood filth, Grindelwald does not. Quite to the contrary he wants non magical people to just have a different role in society. And we can say “oh that role means something horrible” but can we say that? He has yet to explain more on this future muggle role in a wizard run society. The only reason we even think it will be a “bad” role in society is because we think he is the antagonist, and all antagonists have bad agendas. And more so, when have we ever seen a competent muggle at all in the Harry Potter series or lore? From all evidence, wizards are basically superior beings to muggles, with literal power of magic on their sides. What evidence is there to let us confidently say we should let, (from all given evidence in lore) incompetent and arguably lesser beings then wizards, muggles run a part of our society? Another point Grindelwald brings up, is that from his agenda so far, he seems to want to bring muggles and wizards into a shared society, which is something all wizard governing bodies oppose. Wizards have the capacity with their magic to alleviate so much pain, sickness, labor, and slow progression of societal building with their magic. There is no disputing this. Grindelwald, while he might have some flawed methodology and enactment of his political and society agenda, has by far a good sensical cause in his mind. I’m open to you guys’ thoughts."

But in GoF Harry goes to the prefect bathroom. He then gets in a bath that is out in the middle of the room. When Cedric tells him about it he says to go to the prefects bathroom, not the boys prefects bathroom. Does this mean prefect boys and girls share a bathroom. WITH A FULLY VISABLE BATH. So some girl is just enjoying a bath and some boy walks in to pee. What happens?"
3582,spoilers saw crimes of grindenwald my review hi everyone i am a long time harry potter universe fan read all the books and saw all the movies when i came out from the theater after fantasticbeasts i was very pleased it had a lot of new stuff nicely fixed into existing universe moreover it expanded the lore on magical creatures which in my opinion were integral part of the world all along so it is consistently magical it was ok plotwise not complicated not stupid characters were sane believable but not in crimes of grindelwald ok first things first what were the crimes all we are shown is that he is most wanted revolutionary who wants to get wizards in control of muggles because they are dumb in short typical arch villain with dictatorship ambitions we had similar shit with voldemort but he was a magical nazi dude but with voldemort we were told that he killed lots of people had a private army of death eaters and killed harry's parent's for security reasons not with grindelwald what we are shown is that what he wants but not his motivation and that he and dumbledore were gay and loved each other that's all no crimes i also did not like neither johnny depp as grindelwald nor the character appearance at all i did not understood those boots what's up with those the dude is clearly not a goth and nobody around wears that stuff since you can warm and dry yourself with a wand white eye villain that was a cliche imo and johnny depp i like him but not in this movie this villain should've been charismatic revolutionary flaming human torch of progress not an overgrown edge lord with no facial mimic whatsoever gary oldman could've been a good choice for the role but he is too british for the german descent hero but he at least has living facial muscles queenie situation and motivation is just plain dumb queenie is a rare person who sees into other's minds clearly she sees true colors of each around her and falls in love with jacob because of that he is a great human being then with that much of insight of humans she naturally should be a very wise one too since she saw a lot of shit around her and must've learned on that and it was like that in previous movie but not in crimes here we see a semi hysterical damsel who is driven with need be wed even though she knows jacob's reasons of declining that and so on the even bewitches him with that love potion which is plainly crazy and then after their reunion at the end of the movie she joins grindelwald for no reason whatsoever the only reason i could think of is that jk rowling wanted a good character in overall team of baddies so somebody would be kind in edge lord's evil castle in next movies newt and tina situation is unnecessary it is a plot device to get newt to paris to do dumbledore's chores oh well this is dumbledore at his prime as manipulative as his lover believable i loved that jude law was chosen as dumbledore he's a great actor i don't think the dark side of everyone's beloved professor will be shown in the next movies but i can bet that jude will nail it creedence and nagini it is interesting who are creedence parents but it is more interesting how nagini eventually sides with wizard nazis i also don't thing creedence is that powerful everyone are led to believe since that final mountain artillery session is not something exceptional in wizarding world there are spells and trinkets for that leta lestrange is overall useless to the plot and can be harmlessly removed along with creedence being corvus and how leta is bad and bla bla bla honestly her school years flashback does not show her as bad you talk shit about me now you don't tall biatch i also dont think zoë kravitz did an outstanding job of the character as i saw every review state this she seemed very tired all the time no facial mimic only somber glanses from under the brows and edgy teen grade problems also since corvus and leta are dead who held the lestrange name onwards into belatrix lestrange missing chain conclusion jk rowling needs help with writing or has to be a consultant who sets the universe around not the heros and their characters the only bright thing for me in this movie was chinese dragon cat who looked cool had cool abilities and more or less sane sequences that did not wither my eyes with flashes as intro testral driven carriage

more or less sane sequenc that did not wither my eye with flash as intro testral driven carriag chase,"(spoilers) Saw Crimes of Grindenwald, my review Hi everyone. I am a long time Harry Potter universe fan, read all the books and saw all the movies. When I came out from the theater after FantasticBeasts I was very pleased - it had a lot of new stuff, nicely fixed into existing universe. Moreover, it expanded the lore on magical creatures, which in my opinion were integral part of the world all along, so it is consistently ""magical"". It was OK plotwise, not complicated, not stupid, characters were sane, believable.  But not in Crimes of Grindelwald. Ok, first things first. What WERE the crimes? All we are shown is that he is most wanted revolutionary, who wants to get wizards in control of muggles, because they are dumb in short. Typical arch-villain with dictatorship ambitions, we had similar shit with Voldemort, but he was a magical nazi dude. But with Voldemort we were told that he killed lots of people, had a private army of death eaters and killed Harry's parent's for security reasons. Not with Grindelwald. What we are shown is that what he wants, but not his motivation. And that he and Dumbledore were gay and loved each other. That's all. No crimes.   I also did not like neither Johnny Depp as Grindelwald nor the character appearance at all. I did not understood those boots, what's up with those? The dude is clearly not a goth, and nobody around wears that stuff since you can warm and dry yourself with a wand. White eye-villain? That was a cliche imo. And Johnny Depp. I like him, but not in this movie. This villain should've been charismatic revolutionary, flaming human torch of ""progress"". Not an overgrown edge-lord, with no facial mimic whatsoever. Gary Oldman could've been a good choice for the role, but he is too british for the ""german"" descent hero. But he at least has living facial muscles.  Queenie situation and motivation is just plain dumb. Queenie is a rare person, who sees into other's minds clearly. She sees true colors of each around her, and falls in love with Jacob because of that, he is a great human being. Then, with that much of insight of humans, she naturally should be a very wise one too, since she saw A LOT of shit around her, and must've learned on that. And it was like that in previous movie.   But not in Crimes. Here we see a semi-hysterical damsel, who is driven with need be wed, even though she knows Jacob's reasons of declining that and so on. The even bewitches him with that love potion, which is plainly crazy, and then after their reunion at the end of the movie, she joins Grindelwald FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. The only reason I could think of is that JK Rowling wanted a ""good"" character in overall team of baddies, so somebody would be kind in edge-lord's evil castle in next movies.   Newt and Tina situation is unnecessary, it is a plot device to get Newt to Paris to do Dumbledore's chores. Oh well. This is Dumbledore at his prime, as manipulative as his lover. Believable.   I loved that Jude Law was chosen as Dumbledore, he's a great actor. I don't think the dark side of everyone's beloved professor will be shown in the next movies, but I can bet that Jude will nail it.  Creedence and Nagini. It is interesting who are Creedence parents, but it is more interesting how Nagini eventually sides with wizard nazis. I also don't thing Creedence is THAT powerful everyone are led to believe, since that final mountain artillery session is not something exceptional in wizarding world, there are spells and trinkets for that.  Leta Lestrange is overall useless to the plot and can be harmlessly removed, along with Creedence being Corvus, and how Leta is bad, and bla-bla-bla. Honestly, her school years flashback does not show her as bad. ""You talk shit about me? now you don't, tall biatch"". I also dont think Zoë Kravitz did an outstanding job of the character, as I saw every review state this. She seemed very tired ALL THE TIME. No facial mimic. Only somber glanses from under the brows and edgy, teen grade problems. Also, since Corvus and Leta are dead, who held the Lestrange name onwards into Belatrix Lestrange? Missing chain.  Conclusion: JK Rowling needs help with writing, or has to be a consultant who sets the universe around, not the heros and their characters. The only bright thing for me in this movie was chinese dragon-cat, who looked cool, had cool abilities and more or less sane sequences, that did not wither my eyes with flashes as intro testral-driven carriage chase."
3242,grindelwald is not evil but he isn t necessarily a hero ok ok hear me out about this let me first say the grindelwald is not hitler hitler had no reason to get rid of jews like he did grindelwald on the other hand kinda has just motives for wanting to expose wizard kind you even hear him say that he doesn t want to kill all muggles but only the necessary amount plus we have to remember the position they are in to most wizards it isn t fair how they cannot be free and cannot marry who they want and express themselves after thinking for a while can we really consider him being a villain yes he does some very bad things but as he said in his mind he is doing it for the greater good he wants to forcefully expose wizard kind you can also see the regret he has after killing the muggle family in paris that look to me means that he is making the hard choices for the greater good also we have to consider the ministry now as well like they are true villain of this movie anyone who listens to him must be arrested have you heard of free speech they choose to listen they were not forced also travers practically put dumbledore on house arrest because he won t help them it is not like they can make him bottom line how can we consider him a villain when he wants to help wizards and until we know whether he wants to get rid of most if not all of muggles like vinda rosier or just want to harm some more to forcefully expose wizard kind and rule with them or over them he wants wizards free is that so bad no matter the cost,grindelwald is not evil but he isn t necessarili a hero ok ok hear me out about thi let me first say the grindelwald is not hitler hitler had no reason to get rid of jew like he did grindelwald on the other hand kinda ha just motiv for want to expos wizard kind you even hear him say that he doesn t want to kill all muggl but onli the necessari amount plu we have to rememb the posit they are in to most wizard it isn t fair how they cannot be free and cannot marri who they want and express themselv after think for a while can we realli consid him be a villain ye he doe some veri bad thing but as he said in hi mind he is do it for the greater good he want to forc expos wizard kind you can also see the regret he ha after kill the muggl famili in pari that look to me mean that he is make the hard choic for the greater good also we have to consid the ministri now as well like they are true villain of thi movi anyon who listen to him must be arrest have you heard of free speech they choos to listen they were not forc also traver practic put dumbledor on hous arrest becaus he won t help them it is not like they can make him bottom line how can we consid him a villain when he want to help wizard and until we know whether he want to get rid of most if not all of muggl like vinda rosier or just want to harm some more to forc expos wizard kind and rule with them or over them he want wizard free is that so bad no matter the cost,grindelwald is not evil but he isn t necessarili a hero ok ok hear me out about thi let me first say the grindelwald is not hitler hitler had no reason to get rid of jew like he did grindelwald on the other hand kinda ha just motiv for want to expos wizard kind you even hear him say that he doesn t want to kill all muggl but onli the necessari amount plu we have to rememb the posit they are in to most wizard it isn t fair how they cannot be free and cannot marri who they want and express themselv after think for a while can we realli consid him be a villain ye he doe some veri bad thing but as he said in hi mind he is do it for the greater good he want to forc expos wizard kind you can also see the regret he ha after kill the muggl famili in pari that look to me mean that he is make the hard choic for the greater good also we have to consid the ministri now as well like they are true villain of thi movi anyon who listen to him must be arrest have you heard of free speech they choos to listen they were not forc also traver practic put dumbledor on hous arrest becaus he won t help them it is not like they can make him bottom line how can we consid him a villain when he want to help wizard and until we know whether he want to get rid of most if not all of muggl like vinda rosier or just want to harm some more to forc expos wizard kind and rule with them or over them he want wizard free is that so bad no matter the cost,"Grindelwald is not evil, but he isn’t necessarily a hero Ok ok. Hear me out about this. Let me first say the Grindelwald is not Hitler. Hitler had no reason to get rid of Jews like he did. Grindelwald on the other hand kinda has just motives for wanting to expose wizard kind. You even hear him say that he doesn’t want to kill all muggles but only the necessary amount. Plus we have to remember the position they are in. To most wizards it isn’t fair how they cannot be free and cannot marry who they want and express themselves. After thinking for a while can we really consider him being a villain. Yes he does some very bad things but as he said in his mind he is doing it for the greater good. He wants to forcefully expose wizard kind. You can also see the regret he has after killing the muggle family in Paris. That look to me means that he is making the hard choices for the greater good. Also we have to consider the ministry now as well. Like they are true villain of this movie. Anyone who listens to him must be arrested. Have you heard of free speech. They choose to listen. They were not forced. Also Travers practically put Dumbledore on house arrest because he won’t help them. It is not like they can make him. Bottom line, how can we consider him a villain when he wants to help wizards. And until we know whether he wants to get rid of most if not all of Muggles like Vinda Rosier, or just want to harm some more to forcefully expose Wizard kind and rule with them or over them. He wants wizards free. Is that so bad no matter the cost."

Harry, Ron and Hermione were adamant about never telling anyone else about the existence of the horcruxes until the very end. In Harry's final faceoff with Voldemort, he tells him that his horcruxes are destroyed, heard by everyone present.  I assume that after a good long sleep and a sandwich, Harry, Ron and Hermione debriefed everyone about what they had been doing for the previous nine months. I'm sure Kingsley, as the new Minister of Magic, was particularly interested.  My question is, was this information ever conveyed to the wider population. Maybe the ministry would prefer to keep awareness of such dark magic out of the public eye, so as to not encourage any copycats from following Voldemort's path. But with people like Rita Skeeter always looking for a juicy story, it could have been difficult."

2209,the ultimate harry potter birthday surprise so this is going to be a long thread but i hope some of you might enjoy it been meaning to write it up for a while but figured it was about time last year was my future wife's  birthday and i wanted to do something big she's a massive harry potter fan what follows in the story of how i surprised her for her  with a epic  days of harry potter themed surprises for this i had different gifts for her each day i also wrote several letters in the character of various harry potter characters that basically hinted at the next surprise this took about  months to plan and cost a pretty penny but i hope it might give some others some ideas here goes sunday her birthday so this was the first day she woke up finds a stuffed hedwig on the coffee table with a letter from the ministry of magic informing her that she has been selected for a special trip into the magical world as part of an experiment and i am the wizard who will be guiding her through this and she must make her way to edinburgh yeah its nerdy its cringe but ohhh so much fun there was also a small harry potter charms bracelet and each time she opened a letter she got a new charm for it and there where a lot of letters so we get to edinburgh where i take her to the elephant room a cafe with lots of hp connections where i give her another letter this time from mcgnagall that says she has to go for a history lesson the history lesson was actually a harry potter walking tour of edinburgh it was really good fun very good guid i highly recommend this after that we check into our hotel visit two harry potter shops in edinburgh we go for dinner she gets another letter this time from mad eye moody saying that a powerful dark wizard has broken into the edinburgh ministry of magic offices to steal some prophecy and unfortunately i am the only auroa about so must take my muggle with me to go fend of this threat i might have alluded to me being a pretty big time wizard in the letters this was so funny because she couldn't work this letter out but it was actually a harry potter themed escape room this was the first time either of us had done an escape room and despite us both being drunk after drinking lots of what was called butter beer but i think was actually just beer we managed to escape the room she said this was her favourite part of the trip and its only day one sunday so sunday morning we get up she has no idea what's happening next and wouldn't you know it she's got another letter this time it's from percy wheezily saying that the ministry of magic needs her to go to london so we get on a train and that's basically the entire day a train from edinburgh to london we get on the train and i give her a small package its a big bag of harry potter themed sweets from hagrid you know so we don't get hungry on the train once we got to london obviously we went to the shop at kings on platform  and  which was fun got a few gifts checked into the hotel went for dinner got back to the hotel and someone had left her a small package with in the package is a note from garrick ollivander saying that dumbledore wanted to send her a gift for her

because tomorrow morning she had to go and sit a wizarding exam wednesday when we woke we discovered that a house elf had got into our hotel room and wrote her yet another letter but also left the strange gift of socks but we had no time to think on that because we had an exam to get to well that exam was actually another escape room which although fun was not as good as the one we had done a few nights ago in edinburgh after this the next letter was from ron saying that hermione was mental and that his dad had booked us on a tour for muggles we missed the tour due to not being able to find the starting point but i was not deterred i had done my home work and knew all the sites i needed to show her so we done a funny impromptu amateur true of the harry potter sites of london at this point she was getting a bit jittery and even a little annoyed with me dragging her round london but i had planned for this so gave her a howler send by umbridge basically telling her to shut up and just go with it then she gets a letter from a rather angry snape telling her that she has to attend one of his potions classes which was actually just afternoon tea at a cafe called cutter squidge now if am honest this was the worst bit of it all i didn't feel i got value for money but was still something fun and harry potter themed the hostess was amazing so by the end of the day we get back to

train home and there where no seat for a long portion of the journey still we had a lot of fun look back on the week we had just had,"The Ultimate Harry Potter Birthday Surprise!!! So this is going to be a long thread but I hope some of you might enjoy it, been meaning to write it up for a while but figured it was about time. Last year was my future wife's 30th birthday and I wanted to do something big, she's a massive Harry Potter fan, what follows in the story of how I surprised her for her 30th. With a epic 5 days of Harry Potter themed surprises. For this I had different gifts for her each day, I also wrote several letters in the character of various Harry Potter characters that basically hinted at the next surprise. This took about 6 months to plan and cost a pretty penny but I hope it might give some others some ideas.   Here goes.   **Sunday (her birthday).**   So this was the first day, she woke up, finds a stuffed hedwig on the coffee table with a letter from the ""ministry of magic"" informing her that she has been selected for a special trip into the magical world as part of an experiment and I am the wizard who will be guiding her through this and she must make her way to Edinburgh. Yeah its nerdy, its cringe but ohhh so much fun. There was also a small Harry Potter charms bracelet and each time she opened a letter she got a new charm for it and there where a lot of letters....  So we get to Edinburgh, where I take her to the Elephant room (a cafe with lots of HP connections) where I give her another letter this time from ""Mcgnagall"" that says she has to go for a history lesson. The history lesson was actually a Harry Potter walking tour of Edinburgh. It was really good fun, very good guid, I highly recommend this.  After that we check into our hotel, visit two Harry Potter shops in Edinburgh, we go for dinner... she gets another letter this time from ""Mad-eye Moody"" saying that a powerful dark wizard has broken into the Edinburgh ministry of magic offices to steal some prophecy and unfortunately I am the only Auroa about so must take my muggle with me to go fend of this threat (I might have alluded to me being a pretty big time wizard in the letters). This was so funny because she couldn't work this letter out but it was actually a Harry Potter themed escape room. This was the first time either of us had done an escape room and despite us both being drunk after drinking lots of what was called ""butter beer"" but I think was actually just...beer, we managed to escape the room. She said this was her favourite part of the trip  AND ITS ONLY DAY ONE....  **Sunday.**   So Sunday morning we get up, she has no idea what's happening next, and wouldn't you know it she's got another letter. This time it's from ""Percy Wheezily"" saying that the ministry of Magic needs her to go to.....LONDON!.  So we get on a train and that's basically the entire day a train from Edinburgh to London. We get on the train and I give her a small package, its a big bag of Harry Potter themed sweets from Hagrid, you know so we don't get hungry on the train.  Once we got to London obviously we went to the shop at Kings on Platform 9 and 3/4 which was fun got a few gifts, checked into the hotel, went for dinner, got back to the hotel and someone had left her a small package. With in the package is a note from ""Garrick Ollivander"" saying that Dumbledore wanted to send her a gift for her birthday and to make up for the ""incident"" last night (the escape room) and chose to send her a wand...   **Monday**   So this was fun...  So she gets up and another letter this time from ""Dumbledore"" telling her to be at platform 9 and 3/4 by 11am.   So we get to the station and are standing outside the shop when I hit her with the big surprise....HER PARENTS!, I arranged for them to fly over to celebrate with us and they surprised her at the shop. Was amazing, there where tears. After that we let the bomb drop that we were going to the Harry Potter Studio tour (this has been something she has always wanted to do and nagged me about doing for years). It was again, amazing.   That night we go for dinner, me, her and her folks, when I give her her gift its a special golden snitch pendent and another letter. This time from ""Harry Potter"" that was rather funny but said that she needed to know the rest of his story. Within her birthday card were two tickets to Harry Potter and the cursed child.   **Tuesday.**   To keep this short (sorry long thread I know), basically I kept the morning free for her and her folks to catch up as they were flying home in the afternoon. Then at about 2pm we went off to the theatre to watch the play, both parts, and yes I know that the story is controversial but honestly seeing it live as its supposed to be enjoyed it was amazing.   That night there was another letter from ""Hermonie"" saying that she had to get an early night because tomorrow morning she had to go and sit a wizarding exam.   **Wednesday.**   When we woke, we discovered that a house elf had got into our hotel room and wrote her yet another letter but also left the strange gift of socks. But we had no time to think on that because we had an exam to get to!  Well that exam was actually another escape room which although fun was not as good as the one we had done a few nights ago in Edinburgh. After this the next letter was from ""Ron"" saying that Hermione was mental and that his dad had booked us on a tour for muggles. We missed the tour due to not being able to find the starting point but I was not deterred. I had done my home work and knew all the sites I needed to show her! So we done a funny impromptu amateur true of the Harry Potter sites of London.   At this point she was getting a bit jittery and even a little annoyed with me dragging her round London, but I had planned for this so, gave her a "" howler"" send by ""Umbridge"" basically telling her to shut up and just go with it.   Then she gets a letter from a rather angry ""Snape"" telling her that she has to attend one of his potions classes....which was actually just afternoon tea at a cafe called Cutter &  Squidge. Now if am honest this was the worst bit of it all, I didn't feel I got value for money but was still something fun and Harry Potter themed the hostess was amazing.   So by the end of the day we get back to the hotel where there is one final letter, a personal letter from me this time and no I am not giving any details of it publicly but it was nice.   **Thursday.**   Thursday was crap....we had to get a really long train home and there where no seats for a long portion of the journey.   Still we had a lot of fun looking back on the week we had just had."

From the first action scene where Grindelwald is seen sparing lives during his escape, to each and every killing moments where Avada Kedavras are delivered by his followers without explicitly heard orders from their leader... to the very last action scene where people killed by the blue flames have been warned, aggressive or treacherous... I left the movie theater under the impression that Grindelwald wasn't guilty of any crime at all  (the more questionable are the self defense kills in the Père Lachaise cemetery). And I find this beautiful.  In this case, the Crimes of Grindelwald are those of his followers, and they are motivated by His rhetoric. It gives much more depth to the entire universe of J.K. Rowling, and I find this beautifully executed."

The stone presented itself to Harry in the Mirror of Erised because he sought to keep it from Voldemort, not because he himself wanted to become immortal; likewise, Harry was able to master the Hallows (and, ultimately, death) because he did not seek to run from death (like Voldemort), but because he instead (like the third brother) greeted death as an old friend in the Forbidden Forest when his time had come.  & #   Harry's purity of heart with the philosopher's stone was proof that he would be able to master the hallows at the tale's end. Voldemort should have realised that he couldn't win against Harry the moment the stone presented itself to him, but, of course, he never paid much attention to purity and love.   & #   I'm a huge fan when series loop back around like this, so thought I'd create a post for discussion. That is all."

dreamed about last night and couldn’t get out of my head until I wrote it out.   This story would by an introduction to a new series following the Weasley children into a post Voldemort world.   ————— Harry Potter plot idea:   Intro scene: HP, RW, HG, and their children are all together talking about their adventures and enjoying dinner, butterbeer, and playing with Fred Weasley’s latest inventions and laughing over stories from days past.   As the scene progresses, one of the Weasley children keeps looking out the window. (Rose) she leaves the dining room and sits along the window in the family room, curiously looking into the darkness outside.   The scene cuts to a line of massive snakes creeping through the crops outside of the house.   “Dad!” She screams  HP and RW burst into the room, and ask what’s going on.   Rose explains that she saw a group of large snakes in the fields. There is a silence as HP and RW look at each other as if to know exactly what to do, fear written in their eyes. And immediately the two start sealing the house with protection spells.   The rest of the family runs into the room and Harry tells them to seal the house.   A snap of massive jaws slam against the window and an onslaught of gargantuan snakes barrage different parts of the house hoping to penetrate.  In the confusion, Ron yells to his daughter to go find her brother Hugo. She runs to his room, but can’t find him. She begins to look everywhere.   Eventually the onslaught dies down and the house is quiet.   In the quiet, RW HP and HG try to figure out what’s happened. Ron begins to say that his daughter saw a line of massive snakes circling the house. As he realizes that she isn’t back from getting her younger brother.   Ron leaves the room in a quiet panic and looks into their rooms but no one is there, just signs of distress. Ron begins to panic and notices that the attic door is left open.   Ron goes into the attic, it’s quiet, dusty, and dark. He sees his daughter huddled in the corner, and calls for her.   “Rose, are you okay?”   Ron approaches. But as he lays his hand on her shoulder she begins to giggle. Behind Ron, the sounds of a deep growl as he turns around the screen is filled with the striking mouth of one of the snakes.    Cut to the body of the snake morphing into human feet. A vile drops to the floor as we see the body transforming while the camera pans up to reveal that someone has assumed the identity of Ron with PolyJuice potion.   The imposter says to the girl in the corner “well done... now join the others”   The girl melts into the shape of a small snake and slithers into the darkness.   So begins the adventure of the children lead by Ron’s daughter who eventually notices that there’s something wrong with her father.    The Order of The Serpent"

I’ve often thought that the pureblood supremacy doctrine was unsustainable, and really didn’t make any sense at all.  Aren’t pure bloods a distinct and small minority with most wizards being at least part muggle? I bet the majority of even Slytherins are not pure blooded.  Also, what do the Suptemacisfs  make of the demonstrably false idea that pureblood equal more clever witches/ wizards?  I also find the whole Voldemort take over a bit hard to believe. For starters we know there is a Dumbeldore to hold him in check, if not defeat him.  Logically speaking, wouldn’t there have been many order of the Phoenixs and not just one? The witches/ wizard civilian population is more than capable of learning defensive/ offensive spells.  It’s almost a second amendment gun nutters dream of having a citizenry that is universally armed. In some ways, there really are no pure civilians in wizard world"

Which means that at this point in the second movie Dumbldore is about 35 -45 years old.At the time when dubmbledore and grindelwald were lovers dumbledore found out about gindelwald beimg evil so he warned his sister which then tried to flee by going to the U.S. Then she takes her little brother aurelius which at the time was a baby to save him too.The leta replaces crovous with aurelious and dumbledores sister dies. Dumbledore then blames himself from no taking more care for her and regrets letting her go."
825,was barty crouch junior's character added at the last second mostly everyone talks about how scarily accurate crouch jr portrayed the real moody and how it's strange that every character basically accepts the actual moody including harry after spending the entire year with an impostor now if you were to ask me to guess who put harry's name in the goblet before it is revealed i would never had guessed that the boy who was practically begging his father to hear him out that he was innocent in the longbottoms tortures to have been the culprit and i'm assuming that no other potter fan would have guessed this as well unless you were one of the few who did guess correctly if you did then please tell how you guessed right it is known that the gof had to be rewritten halfway through the process thanks to a plothole that rowling found now we don't have much information on what the plothole was all we can go by is what rowling has said herself in an interview back when gof was first released gt the first three books my plan never failed me but i should have put that plot under a microscope i wrote what i thought was half the book and ack huge gaping hole in the middle of the plot i missed my deadline by two months in the same interview she mentions that the plothole had to do with pulling a weasley cousin from a story who basically had the same function as rita skeeter now this seems to solve the plothole problem except for the whole moody plot twist the thing is once finding out that moody was an impostor the entire time it does seem to be thrown in last minute once you get to think about it especially since only a few key lines could possibly give crouch jr 's position away such as if there's anything i hate more it's a death eater who walked away free and the fact that crouch jr in the pensieve is drastically different from the one that is revealed in the end of the book he basically turns from being an innocent boy begging his release to relishing in the fact that he had helped bring voldemort back to form which leads me to believe that crouch jr wasn't an originally planned character or had been only limited to the pensieve scene before getting promoted to top bad guy the pensieve scene and the moment where sirius black mentions crouch senior threw his own son in azkaban could have easily been written to show just how ruthless senior is and show how not all people who fight against death eaters are saints where does moody come into all of this as for moody i'm led to believe that either he was supposed to be himself the entire time or the pettigrew was to be the original impostor why pettigrew because he was already introduced the last book and had escaped back to voldemort it wouldn't have been hard to believe that he could pull this off after tricking everyone into thinking sirius had betrayed the potters for  years the problem that arises from this though is the marauder's map once harry takes a peek at it he would see pettigrew instead of snape in the potion store and boom caught red handed that is why crouch jr was created or promoted to bad guy if crouch jr had been originally created for the pensieve scene then he could've had another name all rowling would have to do is change his o g name to barty and since the map doesn't distinguish titles such as junior senior etc it made an easy route for harry to mistake the culprit as senior in the potions store and then maybe the big rewrite comes into chapter  the dark mark this is the the basic meat of the entire crouch storyline this is where the the hints and pieces can be picked up that something is off about senior and winky from winky struggling to run as though something was holding her back to senior looking gaunt and pale after coming back from the forest having just as we know discovered junior underneath the invisibility cloak on the ground not to mention the question as to who sent the dark mark up to begin with what about crouch jr 's character afterwards i know that some people wonder why the crouches are rarely ever mentioned again in later books especially since percy talked highly of senior during gof not to mention sirius's story of him now senior can be excused because you know he's dead but what about junior the main catalyst for returning voldemort back to his body he received the dementor's kiss not only because he was too powerful breaking free of the imperius curse and plotting the entire tournament but he was nothing more than a means to fill out the greater plot of the story therefore he was no longer needed when bellatrix filled his role in the later books,wa barti crouch junior' charact ad at the last second mostli everyon talk about how scarili accur crouch jr portray the real moodi and how it' strang that everi charact basic accept the actual moodi includ harri after spend the entir year with an impostor now if you were to ask me to guess who put harry' name in the goblet befor it is reveal i would never had guess that the boy who wa practic beg hi father to hear him out that he wa innoc in the longbottom tortur to have been the culprit and i'm assum that no other potter fan would have guess thi as well unless you were one of the few who did guess correctli if you did then pleas tell how you guess right it is known that the gof had to be rewritten halfway through the process thank

give crouch jr 's posit away such as if there' anyth i hate more it' a death eater who walk away free and the fact that crouch jr in the pensiev is drastic differ from the one that is reveal in the end of the book he basic turn from be an innoc boy beg hi releas to relish in the fact that he had help bring voldemort back to form which lead me to believ that crouch jr wasn't an origin plan charact or had been onli limit to the pensiev scene befor get promot to top bad guy the pensiev scene and the moment where siriu black mention crouch senior threw hi own son in azkaban could have easili been written to show just how ruthless senior is and show how not all peopl who fight against death eater are saint where doe moodi come into all of thi as for moodi i'm led to believ that either he wa suppos to be himself the entir time or the pettigrew wa to be the origin impostor whi pettigrew becaus he wa alreadi introduc the last book and had escap back to voldemort it wouldn't have been hard to believ that he could pull thi off after trick everyon into think siriu had betray the potter for  year the problem that aris from thi though is the marauder' map onc harri take a

saint where doe moodi come into all of thi as for moodi i'm led to believ that either he wa suppos to be himself the entir time or the pettigrew wa to be the origin impostor whi pettigrew becaus he wa alreadi introduc the last book and had escap back to voldemort it wouldn't have been hard to believ that he could pull thi off after trick everyon into think siriu had betray the potter for  year the problem that aris from thi though is the marauder' map onc harri take a peek at it he would see pettigrew instead of snape in the potion store and boom caught red hand that is whi crouch jr wa creat or promot to bad guy if crouch jr had been origin creat for the pensiev scene then he could'v had anoth name all rowl would have to do is chang hi o g name to barti and sinc the map doesn't distinguish titl such as junior senior etc it made an easi rout for harri to mistak the culprit as senior in the potion store and then mayb the big rewrit come into chapter  the dark mark thi is the the basic meat of the entir crouch storylin thi is where the the hint and piec can be pick up that someth is off about senior and winki from winki struggl to run as though someth wa hold her back to senior look gaunt and pale after come back from the forest have just as we know discov junior underneath the invis cloak on the ground not to mention the question as to who sent the dark mark up to begin with what about crouch jr 's charact afterward i know that some peopl wonder whi the crouch are rare ever mention again in later book especi sinc perci talk highli of senior dure gof not to mention sirius' stori of him now senior can be excus becaus you know he' dead but what about junior the main catalyst for return voldemort back to hi bodi he receiv the dementor' kiss not onli becaus he wa too power break free of the imperiu curs and plot the entir tournament but he wa noth more than a mean to fill out the greater plot of the stori therefor he wa no longer need when bellatrix fill hi role in the later book,"Was Barty Crouch Junior's character added at the last second? Mostly everyone talks about how scarily accurate Crouch Jr. portrayed the real Moody, and how it's strange that every character basically accepts the actual Moody, including Harry, after spending the entire year with an impostor. Now, if you were to ask me to guess who put Harry's name in the Goblet before it is revealed, I would never had guessed that the boy who was practically begging his father to hear him out, that he was innocent in the Longbottoms tortures, to have been the culprit. And I'm assuming that no other Potter fan would have guessed this as well (unless you were one of the few who did guess correctly. If you did, then please tell how you guessed right).  It is known that the GOF had to be rewritten halfway through the process, thanks to a plothole that Rowling found. Now we don't have much information on what the plothole was. All we can go by is what Rowling has said herself in an interview back when GOF was first released:  &gt;The first three books, my plan never failed me. But I should have put that plot under a microscope. I wrote what I thought was half the book, and ”Ack!” Huge gaping hole in the middle of the plot. I missed my deadline by two months.  In the same interview she mentions that the plothole had to do with pulling a Weasley cousin from a story, who basically had the same function as Rita Skeeter. Now this seems to solve the plothole problem, except for the whole Moody plot twist.   The thing is, once finding out that Moody was an impostor the entire time, it does seem to be thrown in last minute once you get to think about it, especially since only a few key lines could possibly give Crouch Jr.'s position away, such as ""If there's anything I hate more, it's a Death Eater who walked away free."" And the fact that Crouch Jr. in the Pensieve is drastically different from the one that is revealed in the end of the book. He basically turns from being an innocent boy, begging his release, to relishing in the fact that he had helped bring Voldemort back to form.  Which leads me to believe that Crouch Jr. wasn't an originally planned character, or had been only limited to the Pensieve scene before getting promoted to top bad guy. The Pensieve scene and the moment where Sirius Black mentions Crouch Senior threw his own son in Azkaban, could have easily been written to show just how ruthless Senior is, and show how not all people who fight against Death Eaters are saints.  **Where does Moody come into all of this?**  As for Moody, I'm led to believe that either he was supposed to be himself the entire time, or the Pettigrew was to be the original impostor. Why Pettigrew? Because he was already introduced the last book and had escaped back to Voldemort. It wouldn't have been hard to believe that he could pull this off after tricking everyone into thinking Sirius had betrayed the Potters for 12 years.   The problem that arises from this, though, is the Marauder's Map. Once Harry takes a peek at it, he would see Pettigrew instead of Snape in the Potion Store, and boom! Caught red-handed. That is why Crouch Jr. was created, or promoted to bad guy.  If Crouch Jr. had been originally created for the Pensieve scene, then he could've had another name. All Rowling would have to do is change his O.G. name to Barty, and since the Map doesn't distinguish titles such as Junior, Senior, etc., it made an easy route for Harry to mistake the culprit as Senior in the Potions Store.  And then, maybe the big rewrite comes into Chapter 9, The Dark Mark. This is the the basic meat of the entire Crouch storyline. This is where the the hints and pieces can be picked up that something is off about Senior and Winky, from Winky ""struggling to run, as though something was holding her back,"" to Senior looking gaunt and pale after coming back from the forest, having just, as we know, discovered Junior underneath the invisibility cloak on the ground. Not to mention the question as to who sent the Dark Mark up to begin with.  **What about Crouch Jr.'s character afterwards?**  I know that some people wonder why the Crouches are rarely ever mentioned again in later books, especially since Percy talked highly of Senior during GOF not to mention Sirius's story of him.  Now, Senior can be excused, because you know, he's dead. But what about Junior? The main catalyst for returning Voldemort back to his body?   He received the Dementor's Kiss not only because he was too powerful breaking free of the Imperius Curse, and plotting the entire Tournament, but he was nothing more than a means to fill out the greater plot of the story. Therefore, he was no longer needed when Bellatrix filled his role in the later books."

3098,how aragog could have come to hagrid  through newt theory hi there for a while now we have known that the acromantula aragog prior to coming into hagrid s possession travelled to england as an egg in the pockets of a traveller almost certainly newt s suitcase yet something did not make sense from the start why would an experienced magizoologist the best in his field probably at the peak of his sucess and establishment at  give a significantly large egg that he should recognize to a thirteen year old boy unless he experiences the classic mistake of being too secure in his own abilities that every human especially those in high professions is met with sooner or later there may be another way jk rowling stated that the next movie will take place in  and i m pretty sure this is also when newt and tina finally get together and marry/have their first child now said child may have a few friends why not the son of mr hagrid ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ friends from the north we know that they used to live in the forrest of dean in england where hagrid was born but never learned what mr hagrid was doing for a living but since he fell in love with and married a giant that might just be his expertise who knows maybe he even is/becomes friends with newt being kind of an outsider in the wizarding community as well due to his interest in the giant species which is even heavier frowned upon than magical creatures all the way into the  i wouldn t put it past that they start visiting each other and newt s child/ren along with their cousins etc quickly bond with young hagrid who is happy that they are friendlier to him than most kids having grown up learning from their entire small family and alongside all kinds stranger creatures of course he is at least seven years the senior of the oldest child but i can see him as a gentle older brother figure i can also see him getting along well with newt maybe this is exactly where his interest in magical creatures began __________________________________________________ a brave little sibling now when hagrid enters hogwarts the oldest child of newt and tina is at least  years old and  around the time he is expelled just the age to start making more or less thought through decisions what if he or she learns that hagrid is afraid of going back to hogwarts after his father s death because his grief is still too strong what if the child cannot stand the thought of him being alone with this and steals an egg from newt s case or the hospital maybe simply because it s big and somehow makes sure hagrid doesn t tell anyone maybe sneaking a package into his hogwarts luggage signed with a newt scamander sigil who knows maybe newt had the idea of giving him a pet as well though a more harmless one which his child either didn t know about or found out too late either way the truth eventually surfaces along with hagrid s expulsion and i m sure the poor child will be in great distress thinking it is fully to blame for it yet i m pretty sure noone will be mad at the child since it only wanted hagrid to be happy/not alone and was more than willing to break the rules for it sounds like an excuse the scamander parents would accept it would be a cute story about friendship and even a light in the story of how hagrid was expelled in the way that he could be used as a scrapegoat by tom riddle because of something latter would only find once and much later a true friend

the date right it wa a littl difficult sinc hagrid wa born in decemb thank you veri much for read,"How Aragog could have come to Hagrid 1/2 through Newt (theory) Hi there :)  For a while now, we have known that the Acromantula Aragog, prior to coming into Hagrid’s possession, travelled to England as an egg, in the pockets of a traveller - almost certainly Newt’s suitcase.  Yet, something did not make sense from the start - why would an experienced magizoologist, the best in his field, probably at the peak of his sucess and establishment at 45/46, give a significantly large egg that he should recognize to a thirteen-year old boy?  Unless he experiences the classic mistake of being too secure in his own abilities that every human, especially those in high professions, is met with sooner or later, there may be another way …  JK Rowling stated that the next movie will take place in 1935, and I’m pretty sure this is also when Newt and Tina finally get together and marry/have their first child.  Now, said child may have a few friends … why not the son of Mr. Hagrid?  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________   **Friends from the north**  We know that they used to live in the Forrest of Dean in England where Hagrid was born, but never learned what Mr. Hagrid was doing for a living … but since he fell in love with and married a giant, that might just be his expertise.  Who knows, maybe he even is/becomes friends with Newt, being kind of an outsider in the wizarding community as well due to his interest in the giant species (which is even heavier frowned upon than magical creatures, all the way into the 1990s).  I wouldn’t put it past that they start visiting each other and Newt’s child/ren, along with their cousins etc., quickly bond with young Hagrid, who is happy that they are friendlier to him than most kids (having grown up learning from their entire small family and alongside all kinds stranger creatures). Of course, he is at least seven years the senior of the oldest child, but I can see him as a gentle older brother figure :)  I can also see him getting along well with Newt - maybe this is exactly where his interest in magical creatures began?   __________________________________________________   **A brave little sibling**  Now, when Hagrid enters Hogwarts, the oldest child of Newt and Tina is at least 6 years old - and 7/8 around the time he is expelled… just the age to start making more or less thought-through decisions.  What if he or she learns that Hagrid is afraid of going back to Hogwarts after his father’s death, because his grief is still too strong?  What if the child cannot stand the thought of him being alone with this and steals an egg from Newt’s case or the hospital (maybe simply because it’s big), and somehow makes sure Hagrid doesn’t tell anyone (maybe sneaking a package into his Hogwarts luggage, signed with a Newt Scamander sigil?) ?  Who knows, maybe Newt had the idea of giving him a pet as well, though a more harmless one … which his child either didn’t know about or found out too late.  Either way, the truth eventually surfaces along with Hagrid’s expulsion, and I’m sure the poor child will be in great distress, thinking it is fully to blame for it. Yet I’m pretty sure noone will be mad at the child, since it only wanted Hagrid to be happy/not alone and was more than willing to break the rules for it - sounds like an excuse the Scamander parents would accept :)  It would be a cute story about friendship, and even a light in the story of how Hagrid was expelled … in the way that he could be used as a scrapegoat by Tom Riddle because of something latter would only find once and much later -  a true friend.  __________________________________________________________________________   What do you think? Could this be the way in which Hagrid received Aragog?  (I hope I got all the dates right - it was a little difficult since Hagrid was born in december)  Thank you very much for reading :)"
4032,the chastity case theory spoiler alert hello people oh fantastic beasts this movie keeps me by the mental screen with it s endless clues to future sequels and possibilities for character stories what i want to discuss today is the mystery around mary lou barebone s adoptive daughter chastity something is definitly odd about her and today i want to theorize on what she could be enjoy _________________________________________ the silent observer chastity so far seems to kind of fade away in the background aside credence and modesty she still is kind of an authority figure for the children who come to the salemer s house and gives orders to them yet there is something that makes me suspicious she keeps observing credence or watches the situation as if she was ordered to and when he is shortly before an outbreak of magic she seems to be alarmed as if knowing what is about to happen we don t get to know much about her in the entire movie and yet she always is present like literally waiting to show more of herself and her story almost as if jk rowling was building her up in silence to later reveal her indeed great part in this story but what is it about her why is she observing credence what are her true intentions i thought about it today for a while and i figured there is actually more to her just not to her my theory is that for a great part of the movie we only see someone who took the real chastitiy s place ______________________________________________ a macusa spy the macusa has been keeping an eye on the first salemers for quite a while when the movie takes place they were no serious threat but one that certainly should not be underestimated through their constant propaganda and dependence on existence of magic people my theory is that they wanted to be informed as well as possible about this group s intentions and send a spy to the orphanage they most likely decided observed and then abducted the actual chastity barebone if they didn t use a spell for the disguise they definitely required her hair for the polyjuice potion thus to keep her alive and yes polyjuice can give elder people the appearance of a younger person for a certain amount of time i strongly believe this spy didn t just give them information but also suspected after a while that either credence or modesty could be magical and here we get to something that might fit with a spy for macusa ____________________________________________________________________ percival graves investigation how did graves know about modesty who gave him the information that a wizard or witch might be among the children in the orphanage what if the actual graves and later grindelwald got the information from the spy at the orphanage what if she knew about obscurials and asked him to investigate we know is the head of the auror section in the american ministry of magic and certainly whoever took chastities place is one by the end we see the girl s body lying on the ground yet if she was magic she could have dissaparated and replaced her body with a convincing magic fake one ______________________________________________________________ a dead body the script describes that her corpse is seen lying on the floor after credence had his obscurial outbreak at the orphanage yet when he did break out she was suddenly gone from the chair she had been sitting on while watching the scene and it might be possible that in the spy business of the magic world it is common to be able to leave a fake dead body a trained wizard may find out quickly that it isn t real but a muggle they are easily fooled using magic how could they ever find out it was fake if macusa replaced the real chastity with a spy from the ministry a fellow fan said to me that this might be one reason why tina was banned from the investigation on the second salemers they already had a spy so let s assume she is a trained auror mabye on polyjuice maybe even a senior as we both agreed there would be no problem if she just disaparated once creed s magic started to explode _____________________________________________ where is chastity so if a spy entered and left the second salemers without being spotted where is the real chastity things go dark now i believe that if the macusa doesn t have any other magic in use for shape shifting the girl migh be held captive and kept alive to use her hair for polyjuice much in the fashion of mad eye moody i don t think this is impossible we have seen the macusa s death sentence policy their attidude towards muggles and i still believe from grindelwald s words by the end that there might even be something going on with him also since she was confirmed dead actually it s both possible that they obliviate her and let her go under a new identity maybe change her memory since she is an orphan with no actual relations outside the second salemers or they decide since her body was found it s too dangerous to let her go will we see her again i do believe so i think at some point of the story one of the characteres most likely creed will be brought to a secluded area within the ministry who knows if they won t try to exploit him as well and meet her there maybe spotting her in another cell and rescuing her i wonder how the story will go on since she most likely will have no idea about the obscurial attacks in new york and creed s new life ________________________________________________ so what do you think is it possible that chastities death was fake and are her and the spy s stories yet to come anyway let me know in the

on tumblr for help me with thi,"The Chastity Case (Theory (Spoiler Alert)) Hello people :)  Oh, Fantastic Beasts… this movie keeps me by the mental screen with it’s endless clues to future sequels and possibilities for character stories.  What I want to discuss today is the mystery around Mary Lou Barebone’s adoptive daughter **Chastity**. Something is definitly odd about her, and today I want to theorize on what she could be…  Enjoy :)  _________________________________________   **The silent observer**  Chastity so far seems to kind of fade away in the background aside Credence and Modesty. She still is kind of an authority figure for the children who come to the Salemer’s house and gives orders to them.  Yet there is something that makes me suspicious … she keeps observing Credence, or watches the situation, as if she was ordered to… and when he is shortly before an outbreak of magic, she seems to be alarmed, as if knowing what is about to happen.  We don’t get to know much about her in the entire movie, and yet she always is present, like literally waiting to show more of herself and her story, almost as if JK Rowling was building her up in silence, to later reveal her indeed great part in this story… But what is it about her? Why is she observing Credence, what are her true intentions?I thought about it today for a while and I figured there is actually more to her… just not to her. My theory is that, for a great part of the movie … we only see someone who took the real Chastitiy’s place.    ______________________________________________   **A MACUSA spy?**  The MACUSA has been keeping an eye on the First Salemers for quite a while when the movie takes place. They were no serious threat, but one that certainly should not be underestimated through their constant propaganda and dependence on existence of magic people. My theory is that they wanted to be informed as well as possible about this group’s intentions and send a spy to the orphanage. They most likely decided, observed and then abducted the actual Chastity Barebone. If they didn’t use a spell for the disguise, they definitely required her hair for the polyjuice potion, thus to keep her alive.  And yes, polyjuice can give elder people the appearance of a younger person for a certain amount of time.  I strongly believe this spy didn’t just give them information, but also suspected after a while that either Credence or Modesty could be magical.  And here we get to something that might fit with a spy for MACUSA…   ____________________________________________________________________   **Percival Graves’ investigation**  How did Graves know about Modesty? Who gave him the information that a wizard or witch might be among the children in the orphanage?  What if the actual Graves and later Grindelwald got the information from the spy at the orphanage? What if she knew about obscurials, and asked him to investigate? We know is the head of the auror section in the american ministry of magic, and certainly whoever took Chastities place is one.  By the end, we see the girl’s body lying on the ground… yet if she was magic, she could have dissaparated and replaced her body with a convincing magic fake one...     ______________________________________________________________    **A dead body**  The script describes that her corpse is seen lying on the floor after Credence had his obscurial outbreak at the orphanage… yet, when he did break out, she was suddenly gone from the chair she had been sitting on while watching the scene … and it might be possible that in the spy business of the magic world, it is common to be able to leave a fake dead body… a trained wizard may find out quickly that it isn’t real, but a muggle… they are easily fooled using magic. How could they ever find out it was fake?   If MACUSA replaced the real Chastity with a spy from the ministry… a fellow fan said to me that this might be one reason why Tina was banned from the investigation on the Second Salemers… they already had a spy.  So, let’s assume she is a trained auror, mabye on Polyjuice, maybe even a senior, as we both agreed - there would be no problem if she just disaparated once Creed’s magic started to explode.  _____________________________________________   **Where is Chastity?**  So, if a spy entered and left the Second Salemers without being spotted… where is the real Chastity?  Things go dark now.  I believe that, if the MACUSA doesn’t have any other magic in use for shape-shifting, the girl migh be held captive and kept alive to use her hair for polyjuice, much in the fashion of Mad-Eye Moody. I don’t think this is impossible. We have seen the MACUSA’s death sentence policy, their attidude towards muggles… and I still believe from Grindelwald’s words by the end that there might even be something going on with him. Also, since she was confirmed dead… actually, it’s both possible that they obliviate her and let her go under a new identity (maybe change her memory) since she is an orphan with no actual relations outside the Second Salemers, or they decide, since her body was found, it’s too dangerous to let her go.   **Will we see her again?**   I do believe so. I think at some point of the story, one of the characteres, most likely Creed, will be brought to a secluded area within the ministry (who knows if they won’t try to exploit him as well) and meet her there, maybe spotting her in another cell and rescuing her. I wonder how the story will go on since she most likely will have no idea about the obscurial attacks in New York and Creed’s new life.  ________________________________________________   So, what do you think? Is it possible that Chastities death was fake? And are her and the spy’s stories yet to come?   Anyway, let me know in the comments if you want to add something to this theory. Maybe I’m completely wrong and there is an entirely different explanation for Chastitie’s behaviour.

I read the first few Harry Potter books when I was younger, but sort of fell off. When the final book came out, I was at a friend's house eating dinner when their mom said casually ""so in the last Harry Potter, he dies?"". To which my friend responded, ""mom...not everyone has read the books"" and she quickly apologized.   So I figured, maybe he doesn't die since she was kind of just asking a question. But then my sister casually mentions a few days later that her friend couldn't stop crying after finishing the last book. So I assumed ""well, she couldn't stop crying cause he dies"".   Years later, I eventually start thinking I should finish the Harry Potter books, even though I know he dies in the end. So eventually I get to the part where it's revealed that 'neither can live while the other survives', and I think to myself 'there it is, he definitely sacrifices himself and dies in the end.'  Finally, after years of thinking the series ends with Harry Potter dying, I have finished Deathly Hallows...only to find out that he, in fact, does NOT die. I feel Stupefied."

At weddings, in school, and in town. Very similar to someone who conceal carrys a gun. Wizards of course carry a wand around for more than protection but there is a lot of parallels between carrying a gun around.  This partly ties into why I feel J.K.R is anti-goverment or weary of government.  We see throughout the serious that the ministry does some very questionable/unethical things. Removed Dumbledore from being the head master. Tries executing Buck Beak. Pursues Serius even though he is innocent. Hides information about Voldemort and prison breaks. Takes over Hogwarts and punishes students in unethical ways. The list goes on and on.  Even Harry Potter refuses to cooperate with the ministry because of the way they do things even though they should be on the same side.   What are your thoughts? On Rowling's view on government?  Also not saying Rowling is some radical or anything."

Two battles happen at the same time like in Infinity War: Battle of Wakanda (Pere Lachaise) and Team Iron Man vs Thanos in Titan (Lestrange Mausoleum) while Thor is prepping a weapon at Nidavellir (That one would be Flamel casting some sort of charm/spell to summon his allies like Eulalie Hicks).  Pere Lachaise: Theseus, Travers, Spielman, Arnold Guzman and Aurors vs Vinda Rosier, Krall, Abernathy, Grimson + Grindelwald's men.  Lestrange Mausoleum: Newt, Tina, Leta, Yusuf Kama vs Grindelwald.  Theseus and aurors defeat and capture some of Grindelwald's acolytes, Rosier and Grimson escapes and head straight to the Lestrange Mausoleum  Grindelwald defeats Newt and Co.,Theseus and Ministry arrives and got defeated as well. Choosing sides take place like in the film and blue flames. Flamel and allies arrive to rescue them, Leta survives and they all manage to escape the mausoleum. Wands to the earth happens and seal it.  Honestly, idk how I'll put Credence, Nagini and Jacob in that part. Let me know your thoughts down below."

First of all, all series gave us a different world which belongs to wizards and they were different. The fashion is especially important to create this effect. When you looked Dumbledore in old movies, you could feel this, but in this movie, the line separate the two world is a little bit vanished. All wizards are almost like Clark Kent. They are hiding as a normal people but if there are trouble, they take off their glasses and begin to fly. Has the fashion developed later in the wizarding world ? When dumbledore decide to wear his clothes which we saw in Harry Potter movies ?   Second, all movie is like a theater with its stages and there are no connectivity between these stages. If it was a final project in an art school, it would be fail. Was there no one watch this movie before it was delivered? Or did they complete it too fast?    This movie would far more better than this and should be, because the actors and the Harry Potter universe have a great potential. They shouldn’t waste it."

71,knowing his own death was imminent should or could dumbledore have done more to prepare harry for the horcrux hunt i just finished re reading half blood prince for the first time since i finished it as a kid in  i tend to see dobby hedwig tonks/lupin considered as the hardest hitting deaths but i will never forget sitting on a beach on a family holiday trying to follow the shade around as i devoured the book and the utter hollow devastation i felt at dumbledore's death it all came flooding back tonight one of the things i think jkr does really well with this death is to capture the sense of extinguished potential the moment where harry really understands the magnitude of his final mentor's passing comes just after it occurs to him that he never asked dumbledore the relatively mundane question of how he learnt to speak to the merpeople and that now he'll never be able to it got me thinking about what dumbledore could or should have done to foresee the way in which his own death would impact harry not just emotionally but with specific regards to the task that lies before him obviously the whole year plays out as a kind of riddle  with dumbledore keen to emphasise that understanding even empathising with voldemort is key to defeating him but it feels like he leaves a lot to chance in terms of the practicalities of the mission  do you think dumbledore anticipated dying on the night that he did given that retrieving the ring almost killed him surely he recognised that there was a decent chance this could be the end  knowing the extremity of the danger is bringing harry along to witness what is at best likely to be a near death experience in the cave an attempt at a kind of baptism of fire in the horcrux destruction department i think this is interesting because harry's chief takeaway from the experience is that he doesn't understand pretty much any aspect of what dumbledore does to locate the locket surely this would be more disheartening than encouragin  if he hadn't died that night what more do you think dumbledore would have done to prepare harry in the time he had remaining interested to hear your thoughts,know hi own death wa

Knowing the extremity of the danger, is bringing Harry along to witness what is at best likely to be a near-death experience in The Cave an attempt at a kind of baptism of fire in the horcrux destruction department?

Might turn out to be Graves.  He was obviously a popular character from the first film with a lot of folk admiring colin farrells performance and im pretty sure I might have spotted a few clues on his possible return.  First off, it would make complete sense thst Graves would want a new identity, probably feeling ashamed about being tricked by Grindelwald and putting others at risk, not to mention how others might treat him going forward.  They mention his name at least once and Jacob laughs, almost like its a made up name. Newt stresses for the second time in the movie that he's a auror to really establish that point. Lastly, the first film makes it clear Tina and Graves did have at least a working relationship before she was demoted and he his identity was assumed by Grindelwald, so perhaps with her being upset over Newts ""engagement"" and him feeling ashamed they somehoe comforted each other."

Why didn't Harry use the Felix Felicis potion to help him in his fight with Voldemort? I realize it's a hard potion to make, but it has already been established that Hermione is an extremely good poitioneer (making polyjuice in their second year). If she can do that at 12, surely she can brew a decent batch at 17. I realize they won without it, but if everyone on the Hogwarts side took it, I feel like there would have been fewer casualties."

I suddenly thought she was autistic but without a diagnosis.  If you think about it- she hated loud noises and bright lights and couldn’t stand Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s loud and bright fight.  She was very protected from being touched- Percival fought some muggles off merely touching Ariana which many autistic people feel uncomfortable when it happens.  She was a late developer- Her learning of magic was slow and uncontrollable and some people on the spectrum have learning difficulties.  She had a favourite to whom only she listened to- Aberforth was her favourite as she listened to him and let him feed her.   Do you agree with my theory?

I mean, he could've been a very justified antagonist if he were to become one considering how he life seemed to be a tragedy of some sort. But when i say antagonist of HP, i don't think of him as someone like Voldemort who wants to commit genocide, i think of him as someone who has seen how awful people can be to the point of pure resentment, that he wouldn't bat an eye if the world crashed and burned in front of him. I know that doesn't really sound like him at all, but i just think that it's actually incredible how he is so forgiving and lacks of any bitterness even though he always was one of the victims in kind of situation. He really is a character that is often overlooked, but has an immense sense of guilt and compassion that he actually teaches you the essence of the HP series of love and redemption.  & #   tl;dr: Remus is underrated."

Sure Grindelwald is a liar, and sometimes he even gets stuff wrong, but ending a whole movie with a random lie would just be illogical. * So Percival Dumbledore has to be Credence's father. Based on Credence's age and the established timeline, Credence would have to have been conceived after Percival was sent to Azkaban. * So logically, Percival fathered Credence/Aurelius while at Azkaban.  Not sure how this is possible, but the circumstances of it must have been strange enough that a decision was taken to send the baby by boat to America. And in a way it would sort of make sense for Grindelwald to know about this wayward Dumbledore child even though most other people don't: Grindelwald is kind of a dark guy who probably knows various other evil characters who could probably find out about it if a child were somehow conceived at Azkaban.  Beyond that, I don't know what to say. Hard to imagine exactly \*how\* or \*why\* old Percival would be fathering children in a wizard prison. But as far as I can tell, that's the only answer that makes any sense at all."

Keeper of the Keys So, I made some mistakes last night. But thanks for all the answers in correcting me. I’d like to thank u/franzman86 for all the corrections. Also, thanks to the person who messaged me (who wishes to remain anonymous) about the British ‘CPS’ system. And to the one person who downvoted me, I would like to know why! I spend a lot of time on these, and I want to improve. If these are garbage, please tell that they are, and how I can fix them! Oh, and this one doesn’t make much sense and is pretty short. Wonderful, I know.  *Mistakes I made from the last chapter:* * Apparently you can start High-School in Britain at age eleven (birthday being before or on September 1st). That’s awesome, by the way. * Guns can be effective against wizards. * The CPS system in the 90s was awful and they rarely did anything. I’m glad it’s better now.  *Book:* Philosopher’s Stone, British Version  *Chapter:* 4, The Keeper of the Keys  *Synopsis:* The moment Harry Potter turns eleven, a large man by the name of Hagrid comes to rescue him from the Dursley’s. Here it is discovered that Harry is a wizard, destined to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ironically, in this world, he is famous, everyone knows his name. After the Dursley’s try and fail to keep him in the dark, Harry joins the half-giant to gather his school supplies.  *Reactions from u/Wither_Fire:* * This chapter is the first time someone tells Harry that he looks like his father, but he has his fathers eyes. I’m starting a counter. COUNTER: 1 * This really is an exposition counter. But to a person who would have read this for the first time, fascinating! * We learn of Hagrid’s backstory, and he hasn’t even gotten to the school yet. Wow, J.K. Rowling, already setting up Chamber of Secrets. * Hagrid tries to turn Dudley into a pig, but only manages to put on a tail, saying that he already looked enough like one already. Harry said this a few chapters ago. The author is brilliant at this, giving each character a unique sentence describing their physical appearance. Umbridge is toad like, and Snape has a hooked nose. Trelawny is described by her glasses. Because of this description, when Harry sees the prophecy and recounts a faint image of a woman with large round glasses, we know it’s her. We later on instable know someone by a recurring physical trait. I don’t know if this makes sense or not to anyone else. Oh well (I’m bad at explaining things). * Albus Dumbledore has many titles, one of them being ‘Supreme Mugwump’. Now, what the heck is that? Some sort of Supreme Chancellor (smiles in Sheev)? * Hagrid keeps an owl in his pocket. Shouldn’t this count somehow as animal abuse? * Harry gets his first cake! But in the book, it is spelled correctly. * Hagrid mentions that Voldemort kills the McKinnons (Marlene McKinnon), the Bones (Susan and her mother), and the Prewetts. Wasn’t Molly Weasley’s madden name Prewett? Which makes her two twin brothers Prewetts, too. So Fabian (and the other one who I forgot the name, begins with a G) died by the hands of Voldemort. Also, on another note, she named Fred and George after the initials of her brothers. * A lot of the dialogue in the movie matches up with the ones from the book here, in this chapter. * I love how the letter Harry gets is labeled *The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea*. Wasn’t the hut in the Black Sea? Why wasn’t this more specific? Also, *The Floor*."

3361,theory on elder wander spoilers what if dumbledore and grindelwald made the blood pact so that they could both be the master of the elder wand even if they didn't yet have the wand they knew the lore about the wand's allegaince if they couldn't make a move against each other it would prevent them from stealing it from one another and switching allegiance but then the allegiance would be to both of them and if either was disarmed the wand would default to the other so maybe that's how dumbledore got the wand at the end when tina disarmed grindelwald it switch to dumbledore but still obey grindelwald since they cant make a move against the other one,theori on elder wander spoiler what if dumbledor and grindelwald made the blood pact so that they could both be the master of the elder wand even if they didn't yet have the wand they knew the lore about the wand' allegainc if they couldn't make a move against each other it would prevent them from steal it from one anoth and switch allegi but then the allegi would be to both of them and if either wa disarm the wand would default to the other so mayb that' how dumbledor got the wand at the end when tina disarm grindelwald it switch to dumbledor but still obey grindelwald sinc they cant make a move against the other one,theori on elder wander spoiler what if dumbledor and grindelwald made the blood pact so that they could both be the master of the elder wand even if they didn't yet have the wand they knew the lore about the wand' allegainc if they couldn't make a move against each other it would prevent them from steal it from one anoth and switch allegi but then the allegi would be to both of them and if either wa disarm the wand would default to the other so mayb that' how dumbledor got the wand at the end when tina disarm grindelwald it switch to dumbledor but still obey grindelwald sinc they cant make a move against the other one,Theory on elder wander [spoilers] What if Dumbledore and Grindelwald made the blood pact so that they could both be the master of the elder wand. Even if they didn't yet have the wand  they knew the lore about the wand's allegaince.  If they couldn't make a move against each other it would prevent them from stealing it from one another and switching allegiance.  But then the allegiance would be to both of them and if either was disarmed the wand would default to the other. So maybe that's how Dumbledore got the wand at the end when Tina disarmed Grindelwald it switch to Dumbledore but still obey Grindelwald since they cant make a move against the other one.

3724,spoilers after finally seeing crimes of grindelwald i'm honestly surprised with all the mixed reviews and fan impressions i've read here i was expecting to hate it but i thought it was great not excellent but for sure not as awful as some people here are making it out to be the main thing i want to bring up is that it's not that hard to understand could things have been explained more clearly definitely but with all the fuss everyone was making and all the stories i've heard about lifelong potterheads not being able to understand the plot i was expecting to walk out scratching my head i'm a casual hp fan and i felt that though there were only one or two confusing bits all this we couldn't even summarize the plot after we've seen it seems to be coming from people who weren't paying attention because basically everything made sense it was just a little muddled a fair criticism and one i agree with i'm especially surprised that people didn't understand the credence/corvus baby switch because i thought that was made pretty clear in our group of  only one person felt they had a tough time understanding the movie and it was because they had last seen the first movie  years ago to be fair i'm a fan of the first movie more so than other people i think so i was looking forward to this in truth i felt that the plot was better explained in this movie than in the first one the first movie took me a rewatch to fully understand the obscurus thing but i don't feel like anything in this movie confused me that much obviously there were things i didn't think worked spoilers ahead i think we were given a very poor explanation for queenie to join grindelwald this is the most frustrating thing i thought there were some abrupt scenes and it wasn't always clear which city we were in between london paris new york i wish nagini had been given more to do less mad about this because she'll obviously be in the sequels not enough dumbledore jude law was great some timeline discrepancies mcgonagall credence being a dumbledore etc but i suspect some of these will be explained away in future movies the final battle with grindelwald was great until there was the giant blue flame dragon thing which they had to contain i felt that was overkill and the battle should have ended in the crypt with grindelwald there i got a sense that this is a place setting movie to prepare for future installments hence all the many plots but again i think if you're an astute viewer this won't really confuse you at all now for the things i think really worked johnny depp as grindelwald hell yes whatever doubts people had should be erased by this movie he was absolutely fantastic and stole the show i think the score by james newton howard was beautiful newt as a character remains really endearing and likable in a shy awkward sort of way his love subplot with tina was lovely flashbacks to hogwarts and newt/leta's childhood was very poignant and beautifully done it was also awesome to be back in hogwarts present day really fantastic visual effects jude law again it retains a lot of the heart and humor of the original granted not as much humor as the first one but jacob the niffler s and a few other characters provide some comic relief in a genuine heartfelt way things that i think everyone is nitpicking the plot being difficult to understand just watch the movie and pay attention people nagini yes we needed more but we will obviously see her in the sequels she needed to be introduced at some point credence reveal and other timeline discrepancies perhaps mistakes perhaps will be explained away it's not as good as harry potter of course not these movies didn't have a book series with already developed and lovable characters to be excited about as far as original movie stories go i've been happy with all of the characters so far tl dr movie isn't that confusing it's not perfect and was probably not as good as the first one but i felt it was a worthy

I'm honestly surprised! With all the mixed reviews and fan impressions I've read here I was expecting to hate it, but I thought it was great. NOT excellent, but for sure not as awful as some people here are making it out to be.  The main thing I want to bring up is that it's not that hard to understand. Could things have been explained more clearly? Definitely. But with all the fuss everyone was making and all the stories I've heard about ""lifelong Potterheads not being able to understand the plot"" I was expecting to walk out scratching my head. I'm a casual HP fan and I felt that though there were only one or two confusing bits. All this ""We couldn't even summarize the plot after we've seen it!!!!"" seems to be coming from people who weren't paying attention because basically everything made sense...it was just a little muddled (a fair criticism and one I agree with). I'm especially surprised that people didn't understand the Credence/Corvus baby switch because I thought that was made pretty clear. In our group of 7, only one person felt they had a tough time understanding the movie and it was because they had last seen the first movie 2 years ago.  To be fair, I'm a fan of the first movie (more so than other people I think) so I was looking forward to this. In truth I felt that the plot was better explained in this movie than in the first one (the first movie took me a rewatch to fully understand the Obscurus thing, but I don't feel like anything in this movie confused me that much).   Obviously there were things I didn't think worked (SPOILERS AHEAD):  * I think we were given a very poor explanation for Queenie to join Grindelwald (this is the most frustrating thing) * I thought there were some abrupt scenes and it wasn't always clear which city we were in between London, Paris, New York * I wish Nagini had been given more to do (less mad about this because she'll obviously be in the sequels) * Not enough Dumbledore (Jude Law was great) * Some timeline discrepancies (McGonagall, Credence being a Dumbledore, etc) but I suspect some of these will be explained away in future movies * The final battle with Grindelwald was great, UNTIL there was the giant blue-flame-dragon thing which they had to contain. I felt that was overkill and the battle should have ended in the crypt with Grindelwald there. * I got a sense that this is a ""place-setting"" movie to prepare for future installments, hence all the many plots, but again I think if you're an astute viewer this won't really confuse you at all.  Now for the things I think REALLY worked:  * Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Hell yes. Whatever doubts people had should be erased by this movie, he was absolutely fantastic and stole the show I think. * The score by James Newton Howard was beautiful * Newt as a character remains really endearing and likable in a shy, awkward sort of way. His love subplot with Tina was lovely. * Flashbacks to Hogwarts and Newt/Leta's childhood was very poignant and beautifully done. * It was also awesome to be back in Hogwarts present-day. * Really fantastic visual effects * Jude Law (again) * It retains a lot of the heart and humor of the original. Granted, not as much humor as the first one, but Jacob, the Niffler(s), and a few other characters provide some comic relief in a genuine, heartfelt way.  Things that I think everyone is nitpicking:  * The plot being difficult to understand (just watch the movie and pay attention, people) * Nagini (yes we needed more, but we will obviously see her in the sequels. She needed to be introduced at some point) * Credence reveal and other timeline discrepancies. Perhaps mistakes, perhaps will be explained away * ""It's not as good as Harry Potter!!!"" Of course not, these movies didn't have a book series with already-developed and lovable characters to be excited about. As far as original movie stories go, I've been happy with all of the characters so far.  TL;DR: Movie isn't that confusing. It's not perfect and was probably not as good as the first one, but I felt it was a worthy sequel to the first and appears to be setting the stage for what will probably be a really exciting next chapter in the story."

3770,people who think grindlewald is lying about credence s identity they re wrong spoilers hearing a lot of talk about the reveal at the very end of the movie not making sense this is odd to me as this reveal makes the first movie make a lot more sense here is why  grindlewald going to america after an obscurial makes more sense after this movie how did gg know to go and look for the obscurial in the first place well i think he must have found out that the kendra dumbledore died on the ship to america all from the lestrange servant newt was sent to america to find credence and grindlewald was there too i think dumbledore knew who credence is or at least suspected him to be the child of the prophecy  so grindlewald goes to america to find the child only to discover that an obscurial is

that credence is related to dumbledore  in tcog he purposefully leads credence to the lestrange servant and then has her killed before she can tell him more this drives credence to him  he verifies his belief that credence isn t the child of the prophecy isn t a lestrange at all from the records from the french ministry of magic he places this record for leta and co to find again driving credence to grindelwald  i believe the phoenix we see at the end of this movie is fawkes i believe credence is aurelius and grindlewald is not lying to him when he tells him this  why would kendra hide their brother from aberforth and albus because it s credence is their half brother the result of kendra s relationship with someone besides her husband who was in azkaban at the time  lastly why

better stori,"People who think Grindlewald is lying about Credence’s identity. (They’re wrong.) *Spoilers* Hearing a lot of talk about the reveal at the very end of the movie not making sense. This is odd to me as this reveal makes the first movie make a lot more sense. Here is why:  1. Grindlewald going to America after an obscurial makes more sense after this movie. How did GG know to go and look for the obscurial in the first place. Well, I think he must have found out that the Kendra Dumbledore died on the ship to America, all from the Lestrange servant. Newt was sent to America to find Credence, and Grindlewald was there too. I think Dumbledore knew who Credence is, or at least suspected him to be the child of the prophecy.  2. So Grindlewald goes to America to find the child, only to discover that an obscurial is on the loose in New York. Think about this: he knew Ariana was an obscurial. He was there when she died. He wasn’t after the obscurial power altogether, he was after a weapon against Dumbledore. He deduces that Credence is related to Dumbledore.   3. In TCOG, he purposefully leads Credence to the Lestrange servant, and then has her killed before she can tell him more. This drives Credence to him.  4. He verifies his belief that Credence isn’t the child of the prophecy, isn’t a Lestrange at all, from the records from the French Ministry of Magic. He places this record for Leta and co to find. Again, driving Credence to Grindelwald.   5. I believe the Phoenix we see at the end of this movie is Fawkes. I believe Credence is  Aurelius, and Grindlewald is not lying to him when he tells him this.  6. Why would Kendra hide their brother from Aberforth and Albus? Because it’s Credence is their half brother, the result of Kendra’s relationship with someone besides her husband—who was in Azkaban at the time.  7. Lastly: why doesn’t Dumbledore tell anyone about Credence in the HP books? Well, Dumbledore is infamously secretive. I doubt Aberforth even knows. I mean, Albus doesn’t need another black eye from his brother.  I realize some people hated this movie. But damn if this isn’t the pinnacle JK of plot lines and Dumbledore drama. I realize the movie has issues, but the story is engrossing and doesn’t try to hold your hand at all. If they canceled FB series tomorrow, I’d be fine with it as long as JK finished the story in book form. If FBCOG was a book, I’d bet it’d be one of her better stories."

Ron even said ""'Course, he's very ambitious, Percy, he's got it all planned out. . . . He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . .""

1142,i may have accidentally gone to hogwarts for  years not in the literal sense of course but in how they separated us into  teams houses and the incredible similarities in personality types from within each team i went to a  year middle school  and  grade possibly the worst ages for children right before we entered the school year we were all assigned our teams at the time i thought it was just random but looking back it s clear they separated us by our report cards the smartest being in team  and the dumbest in team  i was very good in math decent in most other subjects and dreadful in  or  others so they placed me in team  and thus i was placed with other students who very like minded we were all overall fairly smart kids and quite cunning no one was the best of the best but we all managed to figured out how to stay in the upper echelon through whatever means necessary team  of course were the super brainy kids they of all the teams kept to themselves didn t cause trouble and usually walked around in very small groups of friends team  kids were always so brash outgoing head strong the types that were always up for the challenge even if they were clearly outmatched ready for the fight team  kids were charming always walked around in super large groups of friends and for the most part all had such humbling and affectionate personalities they always looked so happy and rarely seen not having a great time at the end of the year a championship was held amongst the teams each challenge was different testing our intelligence our physical strengths and our creativeness from trivia games to sporting competitions to performing skits on stage in both years team  won first place with team  coming in  place even though we were all separated by our grades from elementary

Not in the literal sense of course, but in how they separated us into 4 Teams (Houses), and the incredible similarities in personality types from within each team.

At the time I thought it was just random, but looking back it’s clear they separated us by our report cards.  The smartest being in Team 1, and the Dumbest in Team 4  I was very good in Math, decent in most other subjects, and dreadful in 1 or 2 others.  So they placed me in Team 2.  And thus I was placed with other students who very like minded.  We were all, overall, fairly smart kids and quite cunning. No one was the best of the best, but we all managed to figured out how to stay in the upper echelon, through whatever means necessary.  Team 1 of course were the super brainy kids.

In both years, Team 3 won first place, with Team 2 coming in 2nd place.   Even though we were all separated by our grades from elementary school, it’s amazing how that shows in personality types.  It’s not to say that there weren’t popular kids amongst all the teams, or that there weren’t bullies here and there.

So, I think doing 7 books in the same style GRRM wrote the GoT books would be great. Each chapter is narrated by a different character, so you see the story as it goes through multiple eyes. We wouldn't have Harry as one of the narrators because we already have his POV, but it would be fun to go through the minds of Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Draco, and others to get more of the story. This would also allow for us to know what actually went on at Hogwarts during the 7th book, and allow us to know what other characters where up to when Harry wasn't the center of our attention."

Theory **Spoilers** The key to Credence’s identity and his relationship to the Dumbledores is tied to obscurials.  Here's why:  1. Obscurial and Obscurus(es?) have played a major role in the plot of both movies. This is a major theme in the way that horcruxes were in the original series. There was a classic Rowling twist with the Horcruxes when we learned Potter was a Horcrux and had to die in order to defeat Voldemort. It's safe to assume she might implement a similar red herring technique with the Obscurus.  2. The official definition of an **Obscurus** describes it as a ""[dark](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Arts)"" and ""parasitic"" force. This energy could manifest itself as a separate entity that can erupt in violent, destructive fury.[\[1\]](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Obscurus#cite_note-0) 3. In *FBAWTFT* we learn that Newt has successfully separated an Obscurus from the body of a young Sudanese witch. This is also proof that an Obcusrus can be separated from an Obscurial. We also learn that Dumbledore holds Newt in high regard. I think the two are related. 4.  The symptoms of an Obscurial sounds awfully familiar to Ariana's condition described in the Deathly Hallows.  5. We learn in *COG* that Dumbledore lead Newt to New York - where Grindelwald was already searching for the rogue Obscurus.  6. In *FBAWTFT* Grindelwald (as Percival) mentions to Credance that he believes he's searching for a young girl. Ariana was 14 when she died. We find out in *COG* that his obsession with this Obscurus is related to his desire to take out Dumbledore because he can't do it himself.  7. There's obviously a deep emotional wound from Dumbledore and Grindlewald's falling out. I think that Grindlewald would want his death to be personal and cruel.  8. In *COG,* Dumbledore says, “I know this: an Obscurus grows in the absence of love as a dark twin, an only friend. If Credence has a real brother or sister out there who can take its place, he might yet be saved.”  So with these facts out on the table, not to mention the numerous time/plot-line issues that would arise if Credence really was a new Dumbledore, tell me this doesn't make sense.   Credence is actually possessed by Ariana's Obscurus. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald suspect this, and seek to save and use him respectively. The end of this series results in the duel between the two that somehow releases/destroys Ariana's Obscurus (dark twin) thus closing the circle.   I know my explanation is not completely bullet proof, but it sure as hell seems like something Rowling would do. Thoughts?  & #"

For those who remember it was none other than Professor McGonagall, who obtained it from the Ministry if Magic.   So, for those confused about the McGonagall cameo in the new Fantastic Beasts, I theorize that it is no one other Minerva McGonagall herself utilizing a time turner.   For clarification, yes Pottermore states that the use of a time-turner should be limited to 5 hours or less, however it is indisputable that Professor McGonagall is a master of her craft. She is arguably one of the best witches in the magical world at transfiguration. So it goes without saying that she would be more adept at time-travel, and such the usage of a time-turner, than the average witch or wizard."

3434,fantastic beasts  was bad here's how i would've changed it ok first off sorry if you liked the movie but i thought it was bad like almost incomprehensible the plot was a mess the reveals were meaningless and even when the movie started to actually have focus it had been so boring and contrived that the set up for the next one was exhausting to get through j k rowling clearly writes books and not movies and that was apparent as the lack of focus or coherence can only be explained by an author who wants to have a myriad of storylines without the appropriate amount of time to cover them all so much goes nowhere and i think that could be easily fixed first the opening is fine good action engaging and easy to follow gets the plot moving i'd be fine keeping that the way it is after that it makes sense to follow newt who should be the definitive main character like in the last one establish his home life and have him meet his brother and establish his engagement to leta at the ministry drop the stupid tina thinks newt is marrying leta subplot the ministry scene can go down the way it did only with way less exposition have newt request to have his travel ban lifted and establish that it's in order to go to new york to see tina that gives him and the audience clear set goals have the ministry offer newt a job as a auror the catch being that he needs to find and kill creedence as newt is an expert on obscurials instead of having newt turn this down because of not wanting to pick sides have him turn it down because he's not a killer and instead of having the ministry hire some nameless goon to track him down have it be leta herself this offers some major conflict for later on have newt being tracked or whatever and dumbledore manages to get in contact with him anyway and the scene with newt and albus should go similarly to the movie except it should be dumbledore not the ministry who tips off newt that credence is in paris this establishes that dumbledore is one step ahead of them also have newt's change of heart come from the fact that dumbledore wants newt to rehabilitate credence rather than killing him when queen and jacob arrive at newt's place have it be for an actual reason instead of having it be seemingly inconsequential drop the meaningless subplot with the love spell and instead have queenie say that her and jacob are getting married secretly in england and then drop the bombshell that tina was tasked with tracking grindelwald by the american ministry and is now missing this further incentivizes newt to engage in this mission and he reveals to them that he has a lead as to where grindelwald might be instead of it just being jacob and newt queenie should also be joining them in illegally traveling to paris meanwhile in paris establish that credence is looking for clues of his heritage where he comes across the circus and sees nagini having him empathize with her have him meet with her after the show and have them establish a relationship rather than having a relationship that the audience didn't see later you can have creedence watching another performance only when things do go wrong have it be because credence saw nagini being abused and his obscurial came out thus making his presence in paris publicly known when the french ministry does show up to investigate have tina be one of the aurors working undercover for the american ministry yusuf kama whose presence felt entirely forced in the movie can be tina's superior and due to tina's knowledge of the obscurial is visibly suspicious of her have newt and co arrive at paris shortly after this happened and have newt do some magical creature nonsense to find out that tina had been in paris and have them be able to track down the circus that credence was at the scene where the ministry arrives at hogwarts and questions dumbledore as well as leta's flashback was essential to establishing the plot point of the blood oath for the audience as well as giving leta a bit more backstory and should probably be kept minus the nonsensical mcgonagall cameo the main change i would've made is to have dumbledore intentionally reveal newt's location to the ministry and therefore have him set up the later events as he has a habit for manipulating actions in order to reach an end goal at this point grindelwald would've heard about the attack at the circus and sends his followers to search for credence there have them searching the circus at the same time as newt and co and have queenie be able to read their minds and tell that they're working for grindelwald using the magical beasts they subdue them and with queenie's legilimacy are able to derive grindelwald's location before aurors come to arrest the followers tina is involved in arresting the followers and notices that the swooping evil was what had restrained them and puts together that newt is in paris credence and nagini still go to the orphanage where credence grew up and again they're left with more questions than answers the only difference being that instead of grindelwald's followers attacking credence is instead told that as a baby he was transported by a young girl rather than an adult this ties into the mystery element that wasn't properly expunged upon in the movie also if a scene needs to establish grindelwald as a proper villain have him learn about credence searching for answers and order the murder of this woman/house elf hybrid later newt and co are revealed to have stolen hairs off of the followers of grindelwald and on dumbledore's advice head to the paris safe house which is the home of nicolas flamel there flamel can have a similar scene as in the film except this time he serves a purpose which is to provide the trio with poly juice potion queenie and newt drink the potion and disguise themselves as grindelwald's followers to gain access to grindelwald's hideout and hopefully learn of credence's location while jacob stays with flamel tina is working at the ministry of france looking through newt's records from the english ministry when she stumbles across leta's file she's about to read it when yusuf calls her into his office and locks the door tina notices a strange mark on his arm when yusuf asks her how long she had been working for grindelwald tina denies this under the threat of death before finally admitting to being an american spy on the case to find credence barebone yusuf smiles telling her he gave her veretiserum earlier and says that he trusts her and wants her to help him track him down before grindelwald tina says she knows someone who might help newt and queenie make it into grindelwald's safe house where they try to act inconspicuous despite newt's social inadequacy grindelwald shows up and queenie whispers t newt that she can't read his thoughts newt notices a small metal vial on grindelwald's waist grindelwald speaks with them casually about his cause before asking his other followers to leave he then addresses newt by name and asks him about new york newt instinctively pulls out his wand but grindelwald casually disarms him saying they are fighting for the same thing and addressing queenie directly says that he wants harmony between the muggles and the wizards and freedom for them to marry who they like this gives queenie a more direct line of reasoning for her to change sides at the end queenie asks if they are free to leave to which grindelwald allows queenie to do so but asks newt to stay behind newt says he'll meet her at the safe house with jacob grindelwald asks newt what albus has been telling him with newt responding that he hasn't talked to dumbledore since hogwarts grindelwald chastises him for lying and asks him if he's comfortable being a puppet grindelwald's followers start to re enter the room when newt pulls out from his pocket the size changing dragon from the first film and manages to escape with help from his beasts credence and nagini are walking down the street when they are stopped by a wizard handing out cards credence flips the card over and the lettering transforms into an image of gellert grindelwald tina and yusuf investigate the orphanage where they find the dead woman with no marks on her searching through the orphanages registration records they find that credence was originally transferred over  years ago under an unknown name and taken abroad to new york the ministry including leta and newts brother arrive at the safe house on dumbledore's tip and arrest jacob and queenie for traveling across borders illegally before newt arrived back at the house after the incident with grindelwald leta demands to know where newt is to which queenie responds that he was last at grindelwald's hideout they demand they tell them the location after which they'll obliviate jacob which queenie begs them not to do they take them down to the french ministry for questioning where at the same time tina/yusuf arrive to review the records on credence credence and nagini travel to the location on grindelwald's card where he is greeted by none other than grindelwald who is threatened by credence for abandoning him in new york grindelwald apologizes saying that his lineage was destined for greatness credence demands to know where he came from which grindelwald said will be answered in due time if he listens to what he has to say grindelwald asks him to come to his rally later and his heart will tell him what's right he tells credence to wait for his sign then apparatus away newt is hiding from grindelwald's followers when he receives a letter from a mysterious owl saying that's he's needed in the ministry in paris and to bring help newt heads to the ministry pretending to be his brother theseus and manages to get in to the lower levels when he sees that queenie and jacob are being held for questioning his nifflers create a distraction while he manages to get them out when he runs into theseus the two duel and newt starts losing when leta arrives and surprisingly disarms theseus she tells newt they need to get out now tina is examining credence's records when she realizes that the date of credences adoption lines up with the disappearance of a pure blood wizard baby by the name of corvus lestrange just then she hears a commotion as newt has kept his case on him and used a shrinking charm to conceal it allowing him to use a thunderbird in order to fight off ministry officials tina grabs her wand and hurries downstairs to where newt is tina runs into newt as he's running with jacob and queenie toward the exit and she begrudgingly helps him by using her password to get to the ground level as they're all about to reach the exit however yusuf and the ministry guards cut them off and order their arrest on site the reunited group are all jailed in the dungeon below similar to the first one where tina and newt as well as jacob and queenie share emotional scenes yusuf comes down and demands to know where credence is from newt threatening to torture his friends which newt responds that he doesn't know tina tells him he knows credences real name is corvus lestrange queenie reads his mind and realizes he's working for grindelwald confronted by this yusuf orders their execution then leaves newt's bow truckle picks the lock and the gang manage to escape as leta overrides security and returns all their wands newt asks her if she ever had a brother which she responds she didn't want him to hate her for what she did queenie seems unable to read her mind either theseus joins them despite newt's protests saying that stopping grindelwald and finding credence is more important than keeping his job at the ministry leta says that she thinks she knows where credence is but they need to hurry in paris black ribbons cascade over the city only seen by wizards in the film to call grindelwald's followers to an undisclosed location newt with tina jacob leta queenie and theseus apparate in a graveyard leta explains that this is her family's tomb and that the lestrange name died with corvus we see another figure apparate into view credence accompanied by nagini they pull their wands out at him except newt who tries to explain to credence that they don't want to hurt him credence asks if any of them have the answers and if he's actually leta's long lost brother leta gives the same exposition about the switched babies as in the movie and tells credence she wished she knew more credence is hurt by this when suddenly a blue ring of fire appears as grindelwald is starting his speech to his followers tina realizes this was a set up to get them here and there is an apparition lock meaning they can't escape she puts together that leta had set them up and to the heartbreak of theseus leta was working for grindelwald which she also confesses to imploring the rest to just hear him out the begrudgingly start to listen to grindelwald as the ministry shows up to break up the rally with theseus joining them newt notices that vial and releases a niffler into the crowd the speech scene was done really well in the film the only thing i would change is the aftermath when grindelwald draws his flaming circle that kills people unloyal to him queenie and other would be enticed to join his side while tina thesues etc attempt to fight him off when grindelwald is winning and close to killing newt that should be when leta distracts him by offering to join him however she intentionally avoids the fire and duels grindelwald betraying him for her love for newt holding him off just long enough for newt and theseus to escape also instead of credence reluctantly joining grindelwald the fighting should cause his obscurus to come out resulting in the ministry fighting him then to hint at the twist a phoenix should come and help fight off the attackers grindelwald tells credence in his obscurus form to join him which credence does resulting in grindelwald leaving and our heroes except for queenie who joined grindelwald left alone and saddened after losing leta the niffler still gets the vial and we're still left on the same cliffhanger reveal of aurelius dumbledore only the movie behind it is much more focused overall the changes where mostly to the second act which relied on an onfocused low stakes plot with an often times non linear or unconnected narrative that only came together through coincidence as opposed to common themes or a better plot i tried to keep the main revelations the same while altering character motivations to be more believable/in character,fantast beast  wa bad here' how i would'v chang it ok first off sorri if you like the movi but i thought it wa bad like almost incomprehens the

hi obscuru form to join him which credenc doe result in grindelwald leav and our hero except for queeni who join grindelwald left alon and sadden after lose leta the niffler still get the vial and we'r still left on the same cliffhang reveal of aureliu dumbledor onli the movi behind it is much more focus overal the chang where mostli to the second act which reli on an onfocus low stake plot with an often time non linear or unconnect narr that onli came togeth through coincid as oppos to common theme or a better plot i tri to keep the main revel the same while alter charact motiv to be more believable/in charact,"Fantastic Beasts 2 was bad. Here's how I would've changed it Ok first off, sorry if you liked the movie, but I thought it was bad. Like, almost incomprehensible. The plot was a mess, the reveals were meaningless, and even when the movie started to actually have focus it had been so boring and contrived that the set-up for the next one was exhausting to get through. J.K. Rowling clearly writes books and not movies, and that was apparent as the lack of focus or coherence can only be explained by an author who wants to have a myriad of storylines without the appropriate amount of time to cover them all. So much goes nowhere, and I think that could be easily fixed.  & #   First, the opening is fine. Good action, engaging, and easy to follow, gets the plot moving. I'd be fine keeping that the way it is. After that, it makes sense to follow Newt, who should be THE definitive main character, like in the last one. Establish his home life, and have him meet his brother and establish his engagement to Leta at the ministry. Drop the stupid ""Tina thinks Newt is marrying Leta subplot""  & #   The ministry scene can go down the way it did, only with way LESS exposition. Have Newt request to have his travel ban lifted, and establish that it's in order to go to New York to see Tina. That gives him and the audience clear set goals. Have the ministry offer Newt a job as a auror, the catch being that he needs to find and kill Creedence, as Newt is an expert on Obscurials. Instead of having Newt turn this down because of ""not wanting to pick sides"" have him turn it down because he's not a killer. And, instead of having the ministry hire some nameless goon to track him down, have it be Leta herself. This offers some major conflict for later on.  & #   Have Newt being tracked or whatever, and Dumbledore manages to get in contact with him anyway, and the scene with Newt and Albus should go similarly to the movie, except it should be Dumbledore, not the ministry, who tips off Newt that Credence is in Paris. This establishes that Dumbledore is one step ahead of them. Also, have Newt's change of heart come from the fact that Dumbledore wants Newt to rehabilitate Credence rather than killing him.  & #   When Queen and Jacob arrive at Newt's place, have it be for an actual reason, instead of having it be seemingly inconsequential. Drop the meaningless subplot with the love spell and instead have Queenie say that her and Jacob are getting married secretly in England. And then drop the bombshell: that Tina was tasked with tracking Grindelwald by the American ministry and is now missing. This further incentivizes Newt to engage in this mission, and he reveals to them that he has a lead as to where Grindelwald might be. Instead of it just being Jacob and Newt, Queenie should also be joining them in illegally traveling to Paris.  Meanwhile, in Paris, establish that Credence is looking for clues of his heritage, where he comes across the circus and sees Nagini, having him empathize with her. Have him meet with her after the show and have them establish a relationship, rather than having a relationship that the audience didn't see. Later you can have Creedence watching another performance, only when things do go wrong, have it be because Credence saw Nagini being abused and his obscurial came out, thus making his presence in Paris publicly known. When the French ministry does show up to investigate, have Tina be one of the aurors, working undercover for the American ministry.  Yusuf Kama, whose presence felt entirely forced in the movie, can be Tina's superior, and, due to Tina's knowledge of the obscurial, is visibly suspicious of her.  & #   Have Newt and co. arrive at Paris shortly after this happened, and have Newt do some magical creature nonsense to find out that Tina had been in Paris, and have them be able to track down the circus that Credence was at.  & #   The scene where the ministry arrives at Hogwarts and questions Dumbledore, as well as Leta's flashback was essential to establishing the plot point of the blood oath for the audience as well as giving Leta a bit more backstory, and should probably be kept, minus the nonsensical McGonagall cameo. The main change I would've made is to have Dumbledore intentionally reveal Newt's location to the ministry, and therefore have him set up the later events, as he has a habit for manipulating actions in order to reach an end goal.  & #   At this point, Grindelwald would've heard about the attack at the circus, and sends his followers to search for Credence there. Have them searching the circus at the same time as Newt and co., and have Queenie be able to read their minds and tell that they're working for Grindelwald. Using the magical beasts they subdue them and, with Queenie's legilimacy, are able to derive Grindelwald's location before aurors come to arrest the followers.  Tina is involved in arresting the followers and notices that the swooping evil was what had restrained them, and puts together that Newt is in Paris.  & #   Credence and Nagini still go to the orphanage where Credence grew up, and again they're left with more questions than answers. The only difference being that instead of Grindelwald's followers attacking, Credence is instead told that as a baby, he was transported by a young girl, rather than an adult. This ties into the mystery element that wasn't properly expunged upon in the movie. Also, if a scene needs to establish Grindelwald as a proper villain, have him learn about Credence searching for answers and order the murder of this woman/house elf hybrid later.  & #   Newt and co. are revealed to have stolen hairs off of the followers of Grindelwald, and, on Dumbledore's advice, head to the Paris safe house, which is the home of Nicolas Flamel. There, Flamel can have a similar scene as in the film, except this time he serves a purpose, which is to provide the trio with poly juice potion. Queenie and Newt drink the potion and disguise themselves as Grindelwald's followers to gain access to Grindelwald's hideout and hopefully learn of Credence's location, while Jacob stays with Flamel.  & #   Tina is working at the ministry of France, looking through Newt's records from the English ministry when she stumbles across Leta's file. She's about to read it when Yusuf calls her into his office and locks the door. Tina notices a strange mark on his arm when Yusuf asks her how long she had been working for Grindelwald. Tina denies this under the threat of death, before finally admitting to being an American spy on the case to find Credence Barebone. Yusuf smiles, telling her he gave her veretiserum earlier, and says that he trusts her and wants her to help him track him down before Grindelwald. Tina says she knows someone who might help.  & #   Newt and Queenie make it into Grindelwald's safe house, where they try to act inconspicuous despite Newt's social inadequacy. Grindelwald shows up, and Queenie whispers t Newt that she can't read his thoughts. Newt notices a small metal vial on Grindelwald's waist. Grindelwald speaks with them casually about his cause, before asking his other followers to leave. He then addresses Newt by name, and asks him about New York. Newt instinctively pulls out his wand but Grindelwald casually disarms him, saying they are fighting for the same thing, and, addressing Queenie directly, says that he wants harmony between the muggles and the wizards, and freedom for them to marry who they like. This gives Queenie a more direct line of reasoning for her to change sides at the end. Queenie asks if they are free to leave, to which Grindelwald allows Queenie to do so, but asks Newt to stay behind. Newt says he'll meet her at the safe house with Jacob. Grindelwald asks Newt what Albus has been telling him, with Newt responding that he hasn't talked to Dumbledore since Hogwarts. Grindelwald chastises him for lying, and asks him if he's comfortable being a puppet. Grindelwald's followers start to re-enter the room, when Newt pulls out from his pocket the size changing dragon from the first film and manages to escape with help from his beasts.  & #   Credence and Nagini are walking down the street when they are stopped by a wizard handing out cards. Credence flips the card over and the lettering transforms into an image of Gellert Grindelwald.  & #   Tina and Yusuf investigate the orphanage where they find the dead woman with no marks on her. Searching through the orphanages registration records, they find that Credence was originally transferred over 20 years ago under an unknown name, and taken abroad to New York.  & #   The ministry, including Leta and Newts brother, arrive at the safe house on Dumbledore's tip and arrest Jacob and Queenie for traveling across borders illegally, before Newt arrived back at the house after the incident with Grindelwald. Leta demands to know where Newt is, to which Queenie responds that he was last at Grindelwald's hideout. They demand they tell them the location, after which they'll obliviate Jacob, which Queenie begs them not to do. They take them down to the French ministry for questioning, where at the same time Tina/Yusuf arrive to review the records on Credence.  & #   Credence and Nagini travel to the location on Grindelwald's card, where he is greeted by none other than Grindelwald, who is threatened by Credence for abandoning him in New York. Grindelwald apologizes, saying that his lineage was destined for greatness. Credence demands to know where he came from, which Grindelwald said will be answered in due time, if he listens to what he has to say. Grindelwald asks him to come to his rally later, and his heart will tell him what's right. He tells Credence to wait for his sign, then apparatus away.  & #   Newt is hiding from Grindelwald's followers when he receives a letter from a mysterious owl saying that's he's needed in the ministry in Paris and to bring help. Newt heads to the ministry, pretending to be his brother Theseus, and manages to get in to the lower levels when he sees that Queenie and Jacob are being held for questioning. His nifflers create a distraction while he manages to get them out, when he runs into Theseus. The two duel, and Newt starts losing when Leta arrives, and surprisingly disarms Theseus. She tells Newt they need to get out now. Tina is examining Credence's records when she realizes that the date of Credences adoption lines up with the disappearance of a pure blood wizard baby by the name of Corvus Lestrange. Just then she hears a commotion, as Newt has kept his case on him and used a shrinking charm to conceal it, allowing him to use a thunderbird in order to fight off ministry officials. Tina grabs her wand and hurries downstairs to where Newt is. Tina runs into Newt as he's running with Jacob and Queenie toward the exit, and she begrudgingly helps him by using her password to get to the ground level. As they're all about to reach the exit, however, Yusuf and the ministry guards cut them off and order their arrest on site. The reunited group are all jailed in the dungeon below, similar to the first one, where Tina and Newt, as well as Jacob and Queenie, share emotional scenes. Yusuf comes down and demands to know where Credence is from Newt, threatening to torture his friends, which newt responds that he doesn't know. Tina tells him he knows Credences real name is Corvus Lestrange. Queenie reads his mind and realizes he's working for Grindelwald. Confronted by this, Yusuf orders their execution then leaves. Newt's bow truckle picks the lock and the gang manage to escape as Leta overrides security and returns all their wands. Newt asks her if she ever had a brother, which she responds she didn't want him to hate her for what she did. Queenie seems. unable to read her mind either. Theseus joins them, despite Newt's protests, saying that stopping Grindelwald and finding Credence is more important than keeping his job at the ministry. Leta says that she thinks she knows where Credence is, but they need to hurry.  & #   In Paris, black ribbons cascade over the city only seen by wizards in the film to call Grindelwald's followers to an undisclosed location.  & #   Newt, with Tina, Jacob, Leta, Queenie, and Theseus, apparate in a graveyard. Leta explains that this is her family's tomb, and that, the Lestrange name died with Corvus. We see another figure apparate into view, Credence, accompanied by Nagini. They pull their wands out at him except Newt, who tries to explain to Credence that they don't want to hurt him. Credence asks if any of them have the answers, and if he's actually Leta's long lost brother. Leta gives the same exposition about the switched babies as in the movie, and tells Credence she wished she knew more. Credence is hurt by this, when suddenly a blue ring of fire appears, as Grindelwald is starting his speech to his followers. Tina realizes this was a set up to get them here, and there is an apparition lock, meaning they can't escape. She puts together that Leta had set them up, and to the heartbreak of Theseus, Leta was working for Grindelwald, which she also confesses to, imploring the rest to just hear him out.  & #   The begrudgingly start to listen to Grindelwald as the ministry shows up to break up the rally, with Theseus joining them. Newt notices that vial and releases a niffler into the crowd. The speech scene was done really well in the film, the only thing I would change is the aftermath.  & #   When Grindelwald draws his flaming circle that kills people unloyal to him, Queenie and other would be enticed to join his side while Tina, Thesues etc. attempt to fight him off. When Grindelwald is winning, and close to killing Newt, that should be when Leta distracts him by offering to join him, however she intentionally avoids the fire  and duels Grindelwald, betraying him for her love for Newt, holding him off just long enough for Newt and Theseus to escape. Also, instead of Credence reluctantly joining Grindelwald, the fighting should cause his Obscurus to come out, resulting in the ministry fighting him. Then, to hint at the twist, a phoenix should come and help fight off the attackers. Grindelwald tells Credence, in his Obscurus form, to join him, which Credence does, resulting in Grindelwald leaving and our heroes, except for Queenie who joined Grindelwald, left alone and saddened after losing Leta. The niffler still gets the vial, and we're still left on the same cliffhanger reveal of Aurelius Dumbledore, only the movie behind it is much more focused.  & #   Overall the changes where mostly to the second act which relied on an onfocused low stakes plot with an often times non-linear or unconnected narrative that only came together through coincidence as opposed to common themes or a better plot. I tried to keep the main revelations the same while altering character motivations to be more believable/in character.  & #   & #   & #"

Like, if harry was only a movie series and they had given more time to kreacher in the ootp, more than half the theatre would have left saying it was unneccesary inclusion in the movie even though his role in the series is of paramount importance later.

I had an anxiety attack last night that was retriggered this morning (we moved today, I haven't worked in over a week trying to prepare - I'm self-employed, the summit I'm planning keeps growing, my youngest is at a stage where everything - joy, anger, sadness - results in screaming and I just got tipped over the edge)  BUT I'm very happy right now because while I've suffered from horrible nightmares since I was a teen, I think I've mentioned here before that listening to the Harry Potter audio books before I go to bed drastically soothes them in a way no other solution has. (Luckily my husband is also a big fan) So, a few weeks ago when I saw some of the Pottery Barn bedding and stuff and was lamenting the fact that our boys aren't old enough for Potter yet, my husband said, ""Why not just get it for us?""   And I did!  I've been hyperventilating on and off all day, was wearing two sweatshirts earlier today even though it was 70 degrees outside because anxiety attacks make me freezing cold and shake, and I walked into our bedroom tonight and instantly felt a little better.  I used to feel weird about seeming like a weird adult still in love with a children's series, but those books meant so much to me in my youth when I was first suffering from depression and anxiety -- along with a lot of crap at home -- and I just love that something little like this can bring me a sense of calm ♥️  I'll post pictures once we add a Hogwarts map print and a few other small decorations 😊"

But director Alfonso Cuarón still wanted Davis in the film so he made him the Hogwarts chorus conductor, not actually Professor Flitwick (to prove this, Davis is listed simply as “Wizard” on the PoA IMDB page).   But GoF director Mike Newell liked the character’s redesign so much that he kept Davis in his new look as Flitwick for the movie, and the rest is history.   This is a cool detail from the movies, and I like Davis’ Flitwick, but I wish the movies somehow addressed the change, such as him casually mentioning a youth charm he invented (something less powerful than the Elixir of Life), or having gotten rid of a magical disease that makes you look older.

Why Luna?     * Luna was eccentric by choice, Harry was forced into it, yet both were outcasts.     * They could both see thestrals.     * Luna knew exactly what Ravenclaw's horcrux was right after Harry asked.     * Luna could read Harry unlike most other people, for example at the wedding when she knew Harry had something on his mind and didn't wanna talk to her and her father.     * Luna was creative and wicked smart, and could have easily been the non-plutonic version of Hermione.   2. Why Ginny isn't right.     * Ginny was always awkward with Harry     * Marrying your crush who also happened to save your life is way too Hollywood.     * Ginny and Harry had very little verbal chemistry in the movies     * Harry's attraction to Ginny in the movies was borderline creep-from-afar   3. Additional notes     * The Hermione/Harry plutonic friendship was portrayed well in the movies, so I can't ship that.     * Ginny and Neville should have ended up married, because the 4th movie foreshadowed it.     * Luna and Neville was almost as random as a 10-year-late retcon-tweet from JK Rowling."

I believe we all can agree that he did possess the Wand as it showed him taking it as a youth in the Deathly Hallows.](/spoiler)  [What interested me was that Tina disarmed him before he was captured. Wouldn't the rules of possession of the Elder Wand, as stated in the Deathly Hallows, say that Tina became the master of the Wand after disarming its master? We see this happen when Draco disarms Dumbledore in The Halfblood Prince and again when Harry rips a generic Wand from Draco's hand in the Deathly Hallows. By this reasoning, since Tina disarmed Grindlewald, even from a normal wand, the Elder Wand would have given its allegiance to Tina.](/spoiler)  [So either this is a large inconsistency in the plot or it is intended which means Grindlewald would need to defeat Tina at a later time.](/spoiler)  Thoughts?

opened a successful toy and candy shop called weasleys wizarding wheezes one of their most popular items was the skiving snackbox candy that would give you a temporary nosebleed or vomiting fit so you could get out of class in other words the weasleys had mastered magic that lets candy physically alter a human being like say turning someone into a blueberry aside from their candy making capabilities there s also their physical similarities they re both redheads with a showman s sense of fashion and there s this little aside wonka makes to mike teavee i'm a trifle deaf in this ear

group on FB) : Willy Wonka is George Weasley: After the events of the books, George used wizard time-travel technology (that is, the Time-Turner, a device that is used once and never mentioned again) to go back and start a new life under a new identity.  And don't give us any guff about all the Time-Turners being destroyed, Harry Potter nerds -- we both know that at least one is floating around the black market, assuming J.K. Rowling hasn't already retconned a few back in. Before George’s brother Fred died  the twins opened a successful toy and candy shop called Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes. One of their most popular items was the Skiving Snackbox, candy that would give you a temporary nosebleed or vomiting fit so you could get out of class. In other words, the Weasleys had mastered magic that lets candy physically alter a human being. Like, say, turning someone into a blueberry. Aside from their candy-making capabilities, there’s also their physical similarities. They’re both redheads with a showman’s sense of fashion. And there’s this little aside Wonka makes to Mike Teavee: ""I'm a trifle deaf in this ear. Speak a little louder next time."" Maybe Wonka’s just being snarky … or maybe it’s a reference to the fact that George lost an ear battling Death Eaters. He may have been able to alter one of his Extendable Ears to serve as a prosthetic, but he couldn’t repair all the actual hearing damage. Then, there are the Oompa Loompas, who are basically slaves who work for chocolate. In Wonka's relatively realistic world, they make no sense, and he dodges the question of their origins. But, in George's magical world, such creatures are commonplace. Heck, little orange men who work their hearts out for no reward are basically creepier house-elves. A resourceful wizard such as George could certainly rustle up a few magical followers.  Now, here's where it gets both oddly convincing and extremely sad. Willy Wonka &  the Chocolate Factory is such a weird film that you probably just took this in stride, but wasn't it creepy that everything in Wonka's office was chopped in half for no apparent reason? Well, maybe that's because George only considers himself half a man without his twin. Wonka's motivations look heartbreaking now. He's not just searching for an heir to his business -- he's looking to replace his dead brother. That's why he hates every kid except Charlie -- they're rich, stupid, and cruel, three qualities that members of the Weasley family don't share."

Hogwarts was where I wanted to live, where I spent my dreams. It was one of the only places where I was truly happy. Where I didn't have to worry. Where I felt normal. It just felt so real.

It is what it is and there are more important things in life to focus  People are mentioning that McGonagall shouldn’t have been at Hogwarts in 1927, but she was also there when Leta and Newt were students which would be in the 19-teens. In those flashbacks she appears to be, and this would make sense for the profession, in her mid-to-late twenties, which would place her birth around 1890. This makes her nearly 50 years older than we were led to believe from JK Rowling’s backstory of her on Pottermore. It also means she is over 100 years old when Harry goes to Hogwarts.  I understand that magical folk live longer with an average life expectancy around 115 years, but to change this detail of her doesn’t just change our perception of her age, but it does change her life experiences.  In the backstory we were given she is born in 1935 which means she would have been a little kid during World War II. But now she was actually an adult for World War I, which we hear impacted the wizarding world too.  I saw somewhere that she was a student while Dumbledore was transfiguration teacher, but clearly now that is not possible. In fact, it becomes less likely she was a student while Dumbledore was a teacher at all given how close they are in age.  This also means that when she is Headmistress during the Cursed Child she is close to 130 years old.   Overall, this really doesn’t matter, especially to casual viewers, but to those of us who enjoy the details it makes it a little frustrating and slightly more difficult to suspend our disbelief."

If I’m right with that then how does Harry kill Voldemort at the end of the deathly hallows (even though all the horcruxes are destroyed). I know Voldemort was using the elder wand but I didn’t think it actually belonged to him so surely his wand is still the same as Harry’s. The only explanation I could think of was that it only mattered if they were actually using the same core wands at the time.  Or because Harry used expeliamus (I think) instead of Avada Kedavra

to Hogsmeade!  The citizens of Hogsmeade are so excited to announce the first annual Summer Carnival! Your faculty liasons during this exciting celebration will be /u/BottleofAlkahest and /u/the-phony-pony. Hogsmeade has given us six possible ways you can participate in the Summer Carnival.  1. Create a game! Carnivals always have fun little game stations for patrons to play. You can turn to the Muggle world for inspiration or create your own game. (We think creating your own might be more fun!)  2. Join the parade! Hogsmeade is looking for floats for the processional down the main road. Create a fun and inspirational ride for all to enjoy!  3. Help the local shops decorate. I'm sure Mr. Aberforth might want some help spicing up the ol' Hogs Head for some new clients.  4. Dress up yourself! Create a festive costume for you (or your magical pet!) to celebrate the occasion!  5. Host a friendly competition! Some of us like a bit more of a challenge than a simple carnival game. Maybe a high stakes game would attract more visitors?  6. Host your own food stand! We want to see some special delicacies you might create. Describe your stand - what do you have to sell? Is there a theme? Are you family friendly, or oriented to a more adult crowd?  #Rules:  1. Submissions must, as always, follow the rules of r/harrypotter. 2. Students must have proper House flair in order to submit, but they do *not* need to be part of their House's Common Room. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/wiki/oursub#wiki_join_a_house) for instructions on setting flair. 3. Submissions can be any mixture of written word and visual elements (photo, drawing, video, rendering, etc). However, any visual entry needs to have context provided via captions or other similar written clarification. 4. Only one entry per student. 5. Any **visual** style entry (not written word) must be **ORIGINAL WORK** created for **this assignment**. You may use artwork not your own with credit and only as written submission (such as a photograph of a blue bottle to explain your text submission). Older pieces of artwork you have previously completed are not eligible.  #Points:  * 80 points will be distributed among the Faculty Favorites * 120 points will be distributed for Best In Category (each of the six options above) * 25 points will be distributed among each superlative: Best Visual Entry, Best Written Entry, Most Creative Entry, and Most Competitive Entry (totals 100 points)"

4023,myrtle's murder fb/hp theory hello people in one of my previous theories i stated that we may get to see hagrid being expelled from hogwarts since it fits into the timeline and newt had a part in it yet i wondered how hagrid was expelled because if we look closely at how the case of myrtle s murder there is actually a lot of hints that needed to be covered so tom riddle wouldn t be suspect any longer so enjoy _____________________________________________________________________________ the corpse i already said that newt may be called to the scene/the ministries forensic department to examine the corpse as an expert for magical creatures so what will he see when myrtle was killed there were no physical bruises leave alone a bitemark so either her corpse was left the way it was or tom riddle talented as he was faked the biting marks i do wonder about where he would get fangs from an acromantula from we know he had a good relationship with horace slughorn that time so despite that acromantula poison is very seldom but there is a way how all of this fits together and that is tom riddles magical power and the ability to change memories _______________________________________________ a perfect murder so tom riddle is all alone the basilisk just killed a student he is standing before her corpse this was unintentional and he knows what will happen if he is seen and he has an idea or was prepared already getting aragog how exactly did he know about the acromantula hagrid was hiding i don t know for sure but i believe he found out about him and decided not to tell professor dibbet in case he would need him some day yes i believe tom riddle already prepared himself for an occuring murder since he could call and talk to the basilisk already and knew what it was capable of yet i m not sure if he really wanted to kill someone back then since hogwarts was his only home maybe he already wanted to point the blame towards aragog and stop the murders once he was killed so what if he quickly leaves after the murder and seals the door briefly he then goes for the closet the spider is in puts it under an imperius curse and we know it s possible hides it in his school bag with a room spreading spell _________________________________________ back at the toilet he goes back to the toilet tells aragog to bite the corpse and then can he make the poison going through her blood system because even if a trained magic forensic will still find that this wasn t the cause of her death but we don t know if one could tell in  certainly spells and magic need to be evolved and developed as well over time so he returns aragog to the closet and changes his memories so he doesn t recall the situation he had to flee soon and even if he had claimed that he didn t kill the girl who would believe a monstrous spider able to kill humans returning to the toilet tom probably changes myrtle s memories as well but here we get to a tricky situation myrtle is a ghost i think even for tom it was difficult to change her memory but we know ghosts can be harmed as well sir nicolas was frozen by the look of the basilisk so why not be put under a spell but he may have failed to change her memory completely he is prefect of slytherin that time so even if he speaks parsel can she regognize his voice but maybe he was lucky and myrtle really only remembered large yellow eyes and a boy s voice and that probably wasn t enough _______________________________________________________ myrtle s witness maybe it even was the spider s bite that made people disbelief her it may have been assumed that she simply hallucinated from the poison and her memories are false maybe newt will try and take a closer look at the case but he probably won t be able to proof aragog s innocence either tom riddle will have won for the first time _____________________________________________________ so what do you think did tom riddle perfectly cover

:)  In one of my previous theories, I stated that we may get to see Hagrid being expelled from Hogwarts, since it fits into the timeline and Newt had a part in it … yet I wondered how Hagrid was expelled. Because if we look closely at how the case of Myrtle’s murder, there is actually a lot of hints that needed to be covered so Tom Riddle wouldn’t be suspect any longer…  So enjoy :)   _____________________________________________________________________________   **The corpse**  I already said that Newt may be called to the scene/the ministries’ forensic department to examine the corpse as an expert for magical creatures… so, what will he see?  When Myrtle was killed, there were no physical bruises, leave alone a bitemark… so, either her corpse was left the way it was, or Tom Riddle, talented as he was, faked the biting marks.  I do wonder about where he would get fangs from an Acromantula from. We know he had a good relationship with Horace Slughorn that time, so despite that Acromantula poison is very seldom…  But there is a way how all of this fits together.  And that is Tom Riddles magical power, and the ability to change memories.  _______________________________________________   **A perfect murder**  So, Tom Riddle is all alone - the Basilisk just killed a student, he is standing before her corpse. This was unintentional, and he knows what will happen if he is seen. And he has an idea (or was prepared already).   Getting Aragog  How exactly did he know about the Acromantula Hagrid was hiding? I don’t know for sure, but I believe he found out about him and decided not to tell Professor Dibbet, in case he would need him some day.  Yes, I believe Tom Riddle already prepared himself for an occuring murder, since he could call and talk to the Basilisk already and knew what it was capable of. Yet I’m not sure if he really wanted to kill someone back then since Hogwarts was his only home… maybe he already wanted to point the blame towards Aragog and stop the murders once he was killed.   So, what if he quickly leaves after the murder and seals the door briefly? He then goes for the closet the spider is in, puts it under an imperius curse and (we know it’s possible) hides it in his school bag with a room spreading spell?   _________________________________________   **Back at the toilet**  He goes back to the toilet, tells Aragog to bite the corpse, and then … can he make the poison going through her blood system? Because even if, a trained magic forensic will still find that this wasn’t the cause of her death. But we don’t know if one could tell in 1943… certainly spells and magic need to be evolved and developed as well over time.  So, he returns Aragog to the closet and changes his memories so he doesn’t recall the situation. He had to flee soon, and even if he had claimed that he didn’t kill the girl… who would believe a monstrous spider, able to kill humans?  Returning to the toilet, Tom probably changes Myrtle’s memories as well… but here we get to a tricky situation.  Myrtle is a ghost. I think even for Tom, it was difficult to change her memory… but we know Ghosts can be harmed as well (Sir Nicolas was frozen by the look of the Basilisk), so why not be put under a spell?  But he may have failed to change her memory completely. He is prefect of Slytherin that time, so even if he speaks Parsel… can she regognize his voice? But maybe he was lucky … and Myrtle really only remembered large yellow eyes and a boy’s voice … and that probably wasn’t enough.  _______________________________________________________   **Myrtle’s witness**  Maybe it even was the spider’s bite that made people disbelief her. It may have been assumed that she simply hallucinated from the poison and her memories are false.  Maybe Newt will try and take a closer look at the case, but he probably won’t be able to proof Aragog’s innocence either.  Tom Riddle will have won for the first time.  _____________________________________________________   So, what do you think? Did Tom Riddle perfectly cover up his deed?

I know for me personally, the HP games were a huge part of my childhood growing up and is probably why I'm such a big Potterhead today. If they just re-released the old games for the current generation of consoles and did nothing to change them, I would absolutely love that. However, if they did try to revisit them and change them slightly, I would be down for that too. Or maybe like a legacy edition or something of the like with all 9 of the games (1-6, 7 pt 1 &  2, and maybe Quidditch World Cup).   & #   There is apparently a game in the works that takes place in the Wizarding World but we know very little about it (at least as far as I am aware). I can't wait for that game either, but nothing beats the classics IMO. I am just ready for any kind of interactive experience in this world again. Its been a long time since we got something new in the gaming department for the HP series, its about time we get a new entry. Who else is with me?"

believ him ani doubt would have been quash when snape use the ak,"HBP/DH Thoughts Snape wanted to die after Lily was murdered. His pain and remorse were so extensive that he couldn’t bear to live. In order to repair a soul damaged from misdeeds, especially murder, one must experience remorse so intense it’s unbearable. And Snape experienced that. He regretted abetting Voldemort so deeply the damage he’d done to his soul was repaired. Because Dumbledore gave him that chance and a reason to live–protecting Lily’s son.   So, when Snape asked Dumbledore “What of my soul?” he was a man who knew the consequences of murder, of the damage it does to a person. And he knew what it took to repair that damage. He was speaking from lived experience. But Dumbledore knew that killing someone who wanted and needed to die wasn’t the same as committing murder. Dumbledore needed Snape to kill him so Draco didn’t have to. So Draco’s soul would remain undamaged.   Additionally:  Whenever the “Is Dumbledore evil?” argument comes up, I see people blaming him for not stopping Draco earlier when he knew Draco was trying to kill him. And having just finished HBP again, this frustrates me a lot. Because Dumbledore did everything he could. He tasked Snape with shadowing Draco, with trying to keep him from hurting anyone. He didn’t just let Draco fail around coming close to killing bystanders.“A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as himself. Offer him help and guidance…” “I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy.”  Snape tried and didn’t always succeed.   Dumbledore could not have stopped Draco himself. He could not let Draco know that he was aware of the plot to kill him. Because while Draco was good at Occlumency, he was still a kid and no match for Voldemort. As we know, Draco’s entire assignment was a ruse, a method of punishing Lucius. If Voldemort had believed that Draco had given himself away he’d have killed him in a heartbeat. And Dumbledore knew that. “I appreciate the difficulty of your position. Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you. I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you.”  Dumbledore was already dying, from the Ring curse and from the poison from the cave, but he engineered the method of his death with the specific intention of saving the soul of a teenage boy who’d been trying to murder him. (And for the Elder Wand stuff, of course.) If you think he’s evil, you’re wrong.  (It also continues to fascinates me that Dumbledore flat out told Draco that Snape was his man and not Voldemort’s. But of course, even if Draco had begun to believe him any doubts would have been quashed when Snape used the AK.)"

This is a theory that just came to me the other day (I haven’t seen it elsewhere yet).   So we know that Dumbledore put off facing Grindelwald for a long time because he was afraid of finding out the truth of who killed Arianna. How would facing Grindelwald uncover the truth of that moment? Did Dumbledore think Grindelwald had a better memory than himself? I don’t think so. I think the answer lies in the Elder Wand. Here is where the speculation comes in.   What if Arianna, through her misbehaving obscurus, got her hands on the Elder wand by defeating its previous owner? And Gellert and Albus knew this? What if the fight that broke out between them and Aberforth was over defeating or even killing Arianna to claim ownership of it? And in the heat of the battle someone did kill her and then, seizing the moment, Gellert grabbed the wand and ran.   Now I know what you’re thinking. If Albus was the one that killed Arianna then the Elder wand wouldn’t have worked for Gellert all these years. But this is where the blood pact comes in. I think the blood pact is allowing the Elder wand to work for both of them. That’s why it isn’t resisting him like Voldemort. However, I think Albus knows that in a duel the Elder wand would not kill him and reveal that he was the one who killed Arianna and is the rightful owner of the wand."

So, in DH, not being able to Conjure (or Transfigure things into) food is explained as being a violation of Golpalott’s (I think I mistyped it but whatever)’s third law, which states you cannot Transfigure food, you can only multiply it if you have some. But, in HBP, Hermione conjures birds. Couldn’t these be eaten? Also, Fred and George make Canary Creams, which turns you into a Canary for a while. Sure, it’d be cruel and kind of be cannibalism, but couldn’t you eat people while Canaries? Also, how do you define “food”? Some people eat paper. It’s never mentioned that anyone Transfigures paper, but I’m sure they probably do, so wouldn’t that be a violation?"

317,draco malfoy the boy who made choices one of the reasons the draco was the boy who had no choice thing bothers me so much aside from how deeply it undercuts his both his agency and personal responsibility is that the the choices draco did make were so important he chose to lower his wand on the tower he chose not to kill dumbledore he made a choice as to the kind of person he wanted to be he chose not to identify harry in the manor lucius was right if the malfoy s had been the ones to capture harry potter they d have been showered in glory by voldemort and yet draco still didn t make it happen he also chose to break harry s nose on the train and to cast an unforgivable at him those choices are also important aspects of his character you can t understand draco if you reduce him to a mindless pawn draco had choices he made choices he was used and manipulated by voldemort but he was fully on board with his mission until the reality of what he had to do sunk in he could have made things much easier for himself he stubbornly refused snape s offer of help because he wanted all the gory and it s interesting to me that the people who claim he had no choice tend to overlap a lot with people who claim draco was robbed of a redemption arc he wasn t his character arc was complete in the books and that makes no sense if you want him redeemed first you have to allow him responsibility for his choices so he can atone for them i don t think people really wanted him redeemed i think they wanted it revealed that he d been a soft good guy all along and have harry beg

extrem but i think there s at least a grain of truth in it,"Draco Malfoy–The Boy Who Made Choices One of the reasons the “Draco was the boy who had no choice” thing bothers me so much, aside from how deeply it undercuts his both his agency and personal responsibility, is that the the choices Draco did make were *so important*.  He chose to lower his wand on the tower. He chose not to kill Dumbledore. He made a choice as to the kind of person he wanted to be.   He chose not to identify Harry in the Manor. Lucius was right, if the Malfoy’s had been the ones to capture Harry Potter they’d have been showered in glory by Voldemort. And yet, Draco still didn’t make it happen.   He also chose to break Harry’s nose on the train and to cast an Unforgivable at him. Those choices are also important aspects of his character. You can’t understand Draco if you reduce him to a mindless pawn.  Draco had choices. He made choices. He was used and manipulated by Voldemort, but he was fully on board with his mission until the reality of what he had to do sunk in. He could have made things much easier for himself. He stubbornly refused Snape’s offer of help because he wanted all the gory.  And it’s interesting to me that the people who claim he had no choice tend to overlap a lot with people who claim Draco was robbed of a redemption arc. (He wasn’t. His character arc was complete in the books.) And that makes no sense. If you want him redeemed, first you have to allow him responsibility for his choices so he can atone for them.   I don’t think people really wanted him redeemed. I think they wanted it revealed that he’d been a soft, good guy all along and have Harry beg his forgiveness for misjudging him. Maybe that’s extreme, but I think there’s at least a grain of truth in it."

I went running today and it was so nice out and i was listening to Order of Phoenix on audible to improve my Italian and just really enjoying all of it so i decided spontaneously to prolong my race from around 5-6 km to maybe 12. I run along a river on one side, go over the bridge and then back in the other side, and the bridges are far apart, so there isn't really an in between.  It was fine at first but boy did i start to regret that decision after a while...    Anyhow i pushed through, mostly because i had to to get home and i knew I'd have to wait even longer for some water if i walked home. All the while Harry and the DA were in riding the Thestrals to the ministry, fighting the deatheaters (i mangiamorte, god i love italian!) and so on and i just kept to stupidly telling me 'If Ron can mount an invisible horse, you can run until that tree. If Neville can fight his fears, you can reach that bench...' and so on.  The reason I'm posting this is here though is that it was all worth it because right when I was finally in front of my house and just sitting down on the floor in the shadows Malfoy said to Harry 'La corsa è finita, Potter' which i guess would be ' The race is over, Potter' in English. It was just PERFECT and wouldn't have happened if i had stuck with my normal route.  (And yes i know this could sound like bragging about my running but i just wanted to share so don't hate me, please)"

I just listened to it and it threw me off.

793,detention with dolores is a really compelling perspective on how some victims of abuse chose to keep it a secret the quill punishment umbridge inflicts on harry in that chapter should completely shock the reader out of their suspension of disbelief it's such an insane escalation of violence from a children's story the tone of umbridge's character just explodes from a nosy bureaucrat into a full blown child abuser the shift is so jarring it really should break the story the reader at that point really should be angrily demanding the author answer how could this outrageous abuse possibly

some victims of abuse chose to keep it a secret. The quill punishment Umbridge inflicts on Harry in that chapter ***should*** completely shock the reader out of their suspension of disbelief.  It's such an insane escalation of violence from a children's story.  The tone of Umbridge's character just *explodes* from a nosy bureaucrat into a full-blown child abuser.   The shift is so jarring it really should break the story.  The reader at that point really should be angrily demanding the author answer ""HOW COULD THIS OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE POSSIBLY CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AT ALBUS DUMBLEDORE'S SCHOOL!?""  But the way Rowling lays out Harry's mind, how she paints this picture of a 15 year old's confusion and shame after being victimized like that.  And *why* he's keeping it a secret... it's *really* well conceived:  &gt;'How was detention with Umbridge, anyway?   &gt;   &gt;What did she make you do?’   &gt;   &gt;Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, ‘Lines.’   &gt;   &gt;‘That’s not too bad, then, eh?’ said Ron.   &gt;   &gt;‘Nope,’ said Harry.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\]   &gt;   &gt;‘At least it’s only lines,’ said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much.   &gt;   &gt;‘It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment, really ...’   &gt;   &gt;Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded.   &gt;   &gt;He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge’s room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face.   &gt;   &gt;He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.  It reminded me of this last season of Game of Thrones (I know, everyone's sick of hearing about it).  That was a situation where even when the characters were making choices that *should've* made sense for them, it still felt jarring because the writers failed to build that out.  Then you look at this chapter from Order of the Phoenix and it *just fits.*  You read it and instantly you think:  It makes perfect sense that this character would chose to keep this awful abuse a secret, even though it *should* make no sense at all."

470,plot point questions i have read the hp books more times than i can count they are by far my favorite series of books at least so far but there are a couple of things that have always bothered me jk seemed pretty good at putting reason to the decisions made by harry and especially dumbledore even if we didn t recognize them as they were occurring except for two very major plot points there may be more than what i m pointing out here but these are the ones that stick out to me  dumbledore was adamant that harry not tell anyone what he was learning in his private lessons except for ron and hermione including what he learned about the prophesy this served two very important purposes although only one of them may have been clear at the time dumbledore did not want voldemort to know that he knew so much about his past and more importantly that he knew about the horcruxes dumbledore knowing that his life was soon going to end and knowing that harry may not be able to complete the task ahead wanted to make sure that at least two others could pick up where they left off if needed  dumbledore told snape that voldemort s life was tied to a fragment of soul trapped inside of harry and for him to ultimately be defeated harry must die to the first point i must say it makes perfect sense dumbledore is playing a very grand game of chess and being very careful where he puts his pieces he places them so well in fact that he is still controlling the game long after his death he predicts how harry hermione ron voldemort and even the ministry of magic will react to his death the war and several other subsequent events with near flawless precision as i said it all makes sense up until voldemort knows that harry is hunting horcruxes once he figures this out i don t see any reason why harry would continue to keep it a secret voldemort knows that harry is aware of his anchors to life he knows that harry is in hogwarts he knows that harry will visit ravenclaw tower harry knows that voldemort knows this why on earth would he continue to keep this knowledge to himself even when he goes off to die he only tells neville he has the order of the phoenix including two aurors the weasley family and the hogwarts professors all there ready to fight for him and he doesn t tell any of them a few chapters previous harry has this grand awakening where he seems to understand everything his brain is working in ways that it never did before and he didn t get the hint that the only reason he had to keep this a secret was already blown to the second point why was snape the only one that dumbledore told about the fragment of voldemort s soul that was latched to harry he was very careful to make sure at least three people knew about the other horcruxes snape was probably in more danger of death than anyone including harry not only was he playing a very dangerous double agent game with the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever known it was planned for him to kill dumbledore making him the destined owner of the elder wand dumbledore had at least some idea that voldemort would try to come for the wand at some point so being of above average intelligence he should have planned for the eventuality of snape s demise why then would he leave snape to be the only one who could tell harry about this connection this was an important part of the plan he knew that harry would sacrifice himself to save everyone else thus completing the same protective charm that his mother had given him it just seems crazy to me that he wouldn t put some type of failsafe in place just in case snape were to die before he could tell harry about the connection this in fact very nearly happened i am interested in hearing peoples theories on this or it s quite possible that i am missing the ball completely so feel free to rip it apart if i am,plot point question i have read the hp book more time than i can count they are by far my favorit seri of book at least so far but

They are by far my favorite series of books (at least so far) but there are a couple of things that have always bothered me. JK seemed pretty good at putting reason to the decisions made by Harry, and especially Dumbledore, even if we didn’t recognize them as they were occurring except for two very major plot points. There may be more than what I’m pointing out here but these are the ones that stick out to me.   1. Dumbledore was adamant that Harry not tell anyone what he was learning in his private lessons except for Ron and Hermione including what he learned about the prophesy. This served two very important purposes although only one of them may have been clear at the time.   · Dumbledore did not want Voldemort to know that he knew so much about his past and more importantly that he knew about the Horcruxes.   · Dumbledore, knowing that his life was soon going to end, and knowing that Harry may not be able to complete the task ahead wanted to make sure that at least two others could pick up where they left off if needed.   2. Dumbledore told Snape that Voldemort’s life was tied to a fragment of soul trapped inside of Harry and for him to ultimately be defeated, Harry must die.   To the first point I must say it makes perfect sense. Dumbledore is playing a very grand game of Chess and being very careful where he puts his pieces. He places them so well in fact that he is still controlling the game long after his death. He predicts how Harry, Hermione, Ron, Voldemort, and even the Ministry of Magic will react to his death, the War, and several other subsequent events with near flawless precision. As I said it all makes sense…. up until Voldemort knows that Harry is hunting Horcruxes.  Once he figures this out I don’t see any reason why Harry would continue to keep it a secret. Voldemort knows that Harry is aware of his anchors to life. He knows that Harry is in Hogwarts. He knows that Harry will visit Ravenclaw Tower. Harry knows that Voldemort knows this. Why on earth would he continue to keep this knowledge to himself? Even when he goes off to die, he only tells Neville. He has the Order of the Phoenix (including two Aurors), The Weasley Family, and the Hogwarts Professors all there ready to fight for him and he doesn’t tell any of them? A few chapters previous Harry has this grand awakening where he seems to understand everything. His brain is working in ways that it never did before and he didn’t get the hint that the only reason he had to keep this a secret was already blown?  To the second point, why was Snape the only one that Dumbledore told about the fragment of Voldemort’s soul that was latched to Harry? He was very careful to make sure at least three people knew about the other Horcruxes. Snape was probably in more danger of death than anyone, including Harry. Not only was he playing a very dangerous double agent game with the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever known, it was planned for him to kill Dumbledore making him the destined owner of the Elder Wand. Dumbledore had at least some idea that Voldemort would try to come for the wand at some point so being of above average intelligence he should have planned for the eventuality of Snape’s demise. Why then would he leave Snape to be the only one who could tell Harry about this connection? This was an important part of the plan. He knew that Harry would sacrifice himself to save everyone else, thus completing the same protective charm that his mother had given him. It just seems crazy to me that he wouldn’t put some type of failsafe in place just in case Snape were to die before he could tell Harry about the connection. This in fact very nearly happened.    I am interested in hearing peoples theories on this, or it’s quite possible that I am missing the ball completely so feel free to rip it apart if I am."

3525,dumbledore's ancestry so one of the themes in original series is that it doesn't matter where you come from you can be very well muggle born and still achieve great things it's also important that voldemort embrace his heritage as descendant of legendary wizard and dismiss his non magical roots he even value things of legendary ancestry as more powerful and worthy like with his horcruxes it works well for most of time but in the seventh book we learn that harry is also descendant of powerful ancient wizarding family perevells so ultimately despite the overall theme we have chosen one destined to defeat evil wizard it still works in some way because we have all those other characters that don't need ancient heritage to stand their own and the other themes include friendship cooperation he wouldn't done it all by himself anyway and then it turns out that the other most important person in defeating voldemort who also was the one to defeat the other world threatening evil wizard also comes from mighty family which even has it's own legends that also turn out to be true and they're basically associated with one of most powerful magical creatures he also has far less flaws that harry he usually doesn't need any help it and when he ask for it it's because he himself found that it's the way to go and designed whole plan for others to follow he knew that harry will eventually defeat voldemort and is the only one who can dumbledore is all powerful but he also happens to be part of family where everyone can get pet phoenix is there another family with such a strong trait perhaps the most close one is perevells/potter that are able to pass down valuable heirloom for generations that is also very strong magic item and has actual usage so is dumbledore such

Most people key onto this, but I'd say all of the Marauder era is stuck in that time. Growing up with the war really destroyed that entire generation. Here's where I lose people:  & #   Snape was not a good person. But his life was awful, and in no sense did he have any good role models, loving family, or basic emotional necessities that children need. Lily was that for him, the only spark of hope and love he had in his life. He is a petty vindictive bully, but clearly mentally ill, which explains this.

2248,on the nature of divination prophecy and time travel so i've been thinking about all the time related magic portrayed in canon mostly poa and there appear to be  different but connected types divination by generating and interpreting semi random patterns like tea leaves crystal balls etc it's what's taught in divination class and it's what hermione doesn't believe in because it's too wooly although it does seem to create true although not too useful predictions true prophecy we see both the original one and the one harry witnesses in poa come true they aren't a semi random pattern but a short piece of text that will eventually come true no matter what although it's impossible to tell just how exactly it will happen the time turner creates a closed time loop where events the time traveler witnessed cannot be changed but the way in which they happen can for example they hear the axe sound and assume that buckbeak got executed and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happening but they can change the reason so that buckbeak survives also harry knows for sure that their past selves will be saved since he witnessed it and thus is able to save them since it doesn't change anything the nature of time travel is that anything that has happened that the traveler knows about cannot be changed only things that the traveler doesn't know can since that way it already has happened without the traveler knowing any information about events carried back in time causes the events to happen no matter what the traveler does only details not known to the traveler can be changed just like true prophecies will always happen but details not mentioned in the text of the prophecy can be changed any information carried back in time is essentially a prophecy hermione knows that there will be an axe sound since she has witnessed it and thus it essentially creates a prophecy hermione will hear an axe sound at that moment that cannot be avoided the hp universe by its very nature doesn't allow split timelines if information is carried back in time it cannot prevent itself from happening paradoxes cannot happen you cannot travel back and kill your grandfather and prevent yourself from existing since you exist if you do manage to go back in time and kill your grandfather as a kid then that wasn't your real grandfather both divination and prophecy are probably based on the same magic as time turners but they work in reverse a time turner sends information the person using it back in time divination is magic that fetches random bits of information from the future a pet dying someone leaving prophecy is important information randomly traveling back in time into a seers mind in each case the information from the future will turn true since it's known that it will happen but the details that didn't travel back in time can be changed it all fits together time travel in the hp universe is possible paradox free and when you think about it makes more sense than  of time travel fiction including back to the future and avengers endgame and sorry hermione divination isn't bullshit it's wooly and not too useful since you're pulling random bits of information from the future and placing them into a semi random pattern in front of you but it's a legit form of time magic capable of making accurate predictions at least when you're doing it properly and not just making stuff up to get better grades,on the natur of divin propheci and time travel so i'v been think about all the time relat magic portray in canon mostli poa and there appear to be  differ but connect type divin by gener and interpret semi random pattern like tea leav crystal ball etc it' what' taught in divin class and it' what hermion doesn't believ in becaus it' too wooli although it doe seem to creat true although not too use predict true propheci we see both the origin one and the one harri wit in poa come true they aren't a semi random pattern but a short piec of text that will eventu come true no matter what although it' imposs to tell just how exactli it will happen the time turner creat a close time loop where event the time travel wit cannot be chang but the way in which they happen can for exampl they hear the axe sound and assum that buckbeak got execut and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happen but they can chang the reason so that buckbeak surviv also harri know for sure that their past selv will be save sinc he wit it and thu is abl to save them sinc it doesn't chang anyth the natur of time travel is that anyth that ha happen that the travel know about cannot be chang onli thing that the travel doesn't know can sinc that way it alreadi ha happen without the travel know ani inform about event carri back in time caus the event to happen no matter what the travel doe onli detail not known to the travel can be chang just like true propheci will alway happen but detail not mention in the text of the propheci can be chang ani inform carri back in time is essenti a propheci hermion know that there will be an axe sound sinc she ha wit it and thu it essenti creat a propheci hermion will hear an axe sound at that moment that cannot be avoid the hp univers by it veri natur doesn't allow split timelin if inform is carri back in time it cannot prevent itself from happen paradox cannot happen you cannot travel back and kill your grandfath and prevent yourself from exist sinc you exist if you do manag to go back in time and kill your grandfath as a kid then that wasn't your real grandfath both divin and propheci are probabl base on the same magic as time turner but they work in revers a time turner send inform the person use it back in time divin is magic that fetch random bit of inform from the futur a pet die someon leav propheci is import inform randomli travel back in time into a seer mind in each case the inform from the futur will turn true sinc it' known that it will happen but the detail that didn't travel back in time can be chang it all fit togeth time travel in the hp univers is possibl paradox free and when you think about it make more sens than  of time travel fiction includ back to the futur and aveng endgam and sorri hermion divin isn't bullshit it' wooli and not too use sinc you'r pull random bit of inform from the futur and place them into a semi random pattern in front of you but it' a

harri wit in poa come true they aren't a semi random pattern but a short piec of text that will eventu come true no matter what although it' imposs to tell just how exactli it will happen the time turner creat a close time loop where event the time travel wit cannot be chang but the way in which they happen can for exampl they hear the axe sound and assum that buckbeak got execut and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happen but they can chang the reason so that buckbeak surviv also harri know for sure that their past selv will be save sinc he wit it and thu is abl to save them sinc it doesn't chang anyth the natur of time travel is that anyth that ha happen that the travel know about cannot be chang onli thing that the travel doesn't know can sinc that way it alreadi ha happen without the travel know ani inform about event carri back in time caus the event to happen no matter what the travel doe onli detail not known to the travel can be chang just like true propheci will alway happen but detail not mention in the text of the propheci can be chang ani inform carri back in time is essenti a propheci hermion know that there will be an axe sound sinc she ha wit it and thu it essenti creat a propheci hermion will hear an axe sound at that moment that cannot be avoid the hp univers by it veri natur doesn't allow split timelin if inform is carri back in time it cannot prevent itself from happen paradox cannot happen you cannot travel back and kill your grandfath and prevent yourself from exist sinc you exist if you do manag to go back in time and kill your grandfath as a kid then that wasn't your real grandfath both divin and propheci are probabl base on the same magic as time turner but they work in revers a time turner send inform the person use it back in time divin is magic that fetch random bit of inform from the futur a pet die someon leav propheci is import inform randomli travel back in time into a seer mind in each case the inform from the futur will turn true sinc it' known that it will happen but the detail that didn't travel back in time can be chang it all fit togeth time travel in the hp univers is possibl paradox free and when you think about it make more sens than  of time travel fiction includ back to the futur and aveng endgam and sorri hermion divin isn't bullshit it' wooli and not too use sinc you'r pull random bit of inform from the futur and place them into a semi random pattern in front of you but it' a legit form of time magic capabl of make accur predict at least when you'r do it properli and not just make stuff up to get better grade,"On the nature of Divination, Prophecy and Time Travel So, I've been thinking about all the time related magic portrayed in canon (mostly PoA), and there appear to be 3 different, but connected types:  -Divination by generating and interpreting semi-random patterns, like tea leaves, crystal balls, etc. It's what's taught in Divination class and it's what Hermione doesn't believe in because it's too wooly, although it does seem to create true, although not too useful predictions.  -True Prophecy, we see both the original one and the one Harry witnesses in PoA come true. They aren't a semi-random pattern but a short piece of text that will eventually come true, no matter what, although it's impossible to tell just how exactly it will happen.  -The Time Turner creates a closed time loop where events the time traveler witnessed cannot be changed, but the way in which they happen can. For example, they hear the axe sound and assume that Buckbeak got executed and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happening, but they can change the reason so that Buckbeak survives. Also, Harry knows for sure that their past selves will be saved since he witnessed it and thus is able to save them since it doesn't change anything.  The nature of time travel is that anything that has happened that the traveler knows about cannot be changed, only things that the traveler doesn't know can since that way it already has happened without the traveler knowing.  Any information about events carried back in time causes the events to happen, no matter what the traveler does. Only details not known to the traveler can be changed.   Just like true Prophecies will always happen, but details not mentioned in the text of the Prophecy can be changed.  **Any information carried back in time is essentially a Prophecy.**  Hermione knows that there will be an axe sound since she has witnessed it, and thus it essentially creates a Prophecy ""Hermione will hear an axe sound at that moment"" that cannot be avoided.  The HP universe, by its very nature, doesn't allow split timelines. If information is carried back in time, it cannot prevent itself from happening. Paradoxes cannot happen.  You cannot travel back and kill your grandfather and prevent yourself from existing, since you exist. If you do manage to go back in time and kill your grandfather as a kid, then that wasn't your real grandfather.  Both Divination and Prophecy are probably based on the same magic as time turners, but they work in reverse: A time turner sends information (the person using it) back in time, Divination is magic that fetches random bits of information from the future (a pet dying, someone leaving), Prophecy is important information randomly traveling back in time into a seers mind.  In each case the information from the future will turn true since it's known that it will happen, but the details that didn't travel back in time can be changed.  It all fits together. Time travel in the HP universe is possible, paradox-free and when you think about it makes more sense than 95% of time travel fiction, including Back to the Future and Avengers: Endgame.   And sorry Hermione, Divination isn't bullshit. It's wooly and not too useful since you're pulling random bits of information from the future and placing them into a semi-random pattern in front of you, but it's a legit form of time magic capable of making accurate predictions.  ...at least when you're doing it properly and not just making stuff up to get better grades."

SPOILER ALERT !  First post here. I’m french so feel free to make fun of me for my writing (or anything else).  I’d like to submit an Harry Potter theory to your attention. After watching Fantastic Beasts 2, I tried to understand how Aurelius could be related to Albus Dumbledore. My theory is quite dark so brace yourselves.  I do not believe Aurelius is Kendra Dumbledore’s son though it would be « almost possible » according to the dates : Kendra dies in november 1899, Credence/Aurelius was born « circa 1901 » from what I gathered. But Kendra, assuming she took her hubsband’s name, would not be a true Dumbledore, would she ?  Therefore, I came up with quite a dreadful theory : what if Ariana was raped by Grindelwald ? Aurelius would be a true Dumbledore. Plus, il would explain why Credence was able to master his Obscurus : he would be the very first biological heir of a previous Obscurus and this side of him would be « natural ». It would also explain why he is so powerful : biological heir of Dumbledore AND Grindelwald.  Finally, it could explain the dispute between Albus Dumbledore and Grindelwald and why the dark wizard fled Godric’s Hollow. It would also explain why Grindelwald knows so much about Credence. In the movie, I do believe he says to Credence that Albus is his brother, but let’s face it : would he really say « hey, dude ! By the way, I’m your father because I raped your mother when she was 12 » ? That wouldn’t serve his purpose (killing Dumbledore) really well now, would it ?  What do you think ?"

All the things that can not be explained, that somehow, have to be explained. As we know, until a child turns 11 and a professor goes out to speak with the parents, they have ELEVEN years of uncertainty and probably, thinking something is wrong with their child. This has to have some effect on the children, surely. Knowing you can do things and people being afraid of it. There's no canon that I know of that delves into this. Even though Hermione would have been in this situation, it doesn't seem to be mentioned very often. I wonder if there is a department in the ministry allocated to this? Or a separate job, outside of the ministry. THIS is what actually got me thinking.   & #   If Harry was able to vanish the glass at the zoo when he was angry, imagine what toddlers might be like. The 'terrible twos'? All the things that happen before you turn 11. Their first visit to the dentist? Doctors? Imagine babies being given their first vaccination. Losing a tooth. First friendship, first fight. I wonder just how often these magical occurrences actually happen. Everytime a baby cries for the first few months? Only when scared, sad or angry? What about overexcitement? jealously?      I think it would be really fun to see what everyone's ideas are on what 'damage' the under 11's could actually do and what tricks the ministry (or person responsible) have up their sleeves to deal with these occurrences."

I didn't like it at first, but now it's an obsession. I've got several theories.  I've been told that JKR confirmed that AD and GG were gays, but what I see is something different. I put the blame on the presence of Flamel and some light reading on alchemy, one of my favourite subjects. I know that this is entertainment, but it can be more, and my theory is that it is more. That the audience is reading it 'too literal'. One doesn't play with the figure of Nicholas Flamel in vain.   What I've seen is that AD and GG have very similar personalities, and both oppose Scamander's. Fascinating triangle.   GG is the grand deceiver. I liked very much how he's written as the great manipulator. How he was when played by Colin Farrell and then by Depp. Both did a great job.  AD manipulates too, but softer. He's the guy who always knows what the other person needs to hear, that he admires Newt because bla bla, and Leta, and Theseus. He's also a player. It's just that he's more subtle than GG. He doesn't risk that much.  Scamander, on the other hand, has an amazing talent to connect with all. That's why he's so good with beasts. He persuades. I adore the scene in which he seduces the Chinese dragon. Must say that I've never liked the actor before. He's done an amazing job here.   Perhaps GG and AD are gays, but to me it goes beyond, it reaches their  nature and greed and ambition and power. They both have the same power, but play it differently.   Am I the only one seeing symbolism in the characters, in sentences, ideas blah blah?   Is there much different in the books?"

The Dementors constituted an outside interference and should’ve caused the match to be canceled or temporarily ceased considering their tendencies to drain the life and happiness of everyone them which is particularly dangerous when you’re flying hundreds of feet above the ground as Harry showed. Cedric made the right call trying to reset the match considering that Harry was incapacitated during his flight and therefore not in the right state of mind  to perform properly. What bugs me is that no one else seems to agree not Hooch the referee, nor the rest of the Gryffindors not even the ultra competitive Oliver Wood. It’s not like Harry lost control of his broom, or got hit by a bludger which are risks in Quidditch, he was being mentally assaulted by soul sucking Dementors.  Which is why Amos Diggory’s bragging rubs me the wrong way. O yeah Harry Potter fell his broom and almost died but hey! my kid didnt. Clearly he’s better at flying!"

So I am sure most of us are aware that we will get to see how Dumbledore became the man we know in Harry Potter.  A big part of Dumbledore's philosophy is everyone deserves a second chance.  Maybe we could begin to see a Dumbledore who doesn't believe in that early in the series and see him develope in that way latter on.  I think that he just really liked Newt and maybe he new it was Leta's fault and Newt convinces him to not rant her out. (Talking about Newt's expulsion, we know it was caused by endangering student's lives, but was really caused by Leta)  I am hoping to see this because it is a huge part of Dumbledore's phylosophy and I am curious to know who will make him think that way (or to better put that: who will deserve a second chance but not get one and how will Dumbledore know about that).  Could it be Grindelwald?  In DH Dumbledore says Grindelwald has felt remorce for what he has done.  Could he have started to fell that earlier but had gone to far to turn back?  It could be Credence who it seems will go with Grindelwald and join the enemy.  But deep down he is a suffering boy who doesn't know who he trully is nor where he comes from."

1535,something i don't understand about this fandom people are constantly mocking and criticizing jkr for saying that she always saw dumbledore as gay they say that she should have incorporated this into the story and not have been some random comment outside of it yet these people flipped the fuck out because they thought jkr was trying to say sirius black wasn't gay when answering seven questions in her bio https //consent yahoo com/collectconsent sessionid  session_8e27f5c0     lang en gb inline false so it would be fine if she confirmed that sirius was gay post book but her confirming dumbledore as gay post book is wrong and should be criticized maybe its because people didn't actually care about representation and just wanted sirius to be gay so their ship can be confirmed,someth i don't understand about thi fandom peopl are constantli mock and critic jkr for say that she alway saw dumbledor as gay they say that she should have incorpor thi into the stori and not have been some random comment outsid of it yet these peopl flip the fuck out becaus they thought jkr wa tri to say siriu black wasn't gay when answer seven question in her bio http //consent yahoo com/collectcons sessionid  session_8e27f5c0     lang en gb inlin fals so it would be fine if she confirm that siriu wa gay post book but her confirm dumbledor as gay post book is wrong and should be critic mayb it becaus peopl didn't actual care about represent and just want siriu to be gay so their ship can be confirm,someth i don't understand about thi fandom peopl are constantli mock and critic jkr for say that she alway saw dumbledor as gay they say that she should have incorpor thi into the stori and not have been some random comment outsid of it yet these peopl flip the fuck out becaus they thought jkr wa tri to say siriu black wasn't gay when answer seven question in her bio http //consent yahoo com/collectcons sessionid  session_8e27f5c0     lang en gb inlin fals so it would be fine if she confirm that siriu wa gay post book but her confirm dumbledor as gay post book is wrong and should be critic mayb it becaus peopl didn't actual care about represent and just want siriu to be gay so their ship can be confirm,Something I don't understand about this fandom People are constantly mocking and criticizing JKR for saying that she always saw Dumbledore as gay. They say that she should have incorporated this into the story and not have been some random comment outside of it.  Yet these people flipped the fuck out because they thought JKR was trying to say Sirius Black wasn't gay when [answering seven questions in her bio](https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=2_cc-session_8e27f5c0-56a9-44ab-86e7-7ec4bdf45c12& lang=en-gb& inline=false).  So it would be fine if she confirmed that Sirius was gay post-book. But her confirming Dumbledore as gay post-book is wrong and should be criticized?  & #   ~~^(maybe its because people didn't actually care about representation and just wanted  Sirius to be gay so their ship can be confirmed.)~~

2474,harry potter reread philosopher's stone chapter  the vanishing glass wow so i failed last yesterday night i made so many mistakes and that's a good thing it shows that i truly desperately need a reread of the series or that i was really tired last night either or because of this i will be adding a new section for fixing my mistakes and yes i made a lot of them thanks so much guys on correcting me i made a lot of truly awful mistakes i won't be fixing them either this is going to remain a faithful record of my sixteen cringey self mistakes i made from the last chapter there are other pov in the series besides vernon i cannot believe i made that error how could i forget frank bryce or even the minister of magic my friends would be ashamed of me heck i'm ashamed of me too the timeline in which sirius gives hagrid the motorcycle what i said was wrong and the details are covered in chamber of secrets and prisoner of azkaban he gives hagrid the motorcycle when he learns of james and lily's passing and before he 'kills' peter pettigrew this is another stupid mistake on my behalf dedalus diggle doesn't die however there was attempted murder so i at least remember something while there were many of you who corrected me thanks again i'd like to thank u/om_1990 especially for his great on point answers book harry potter and the philosopher's stone british version chapter  the vanishing glass synopsis in this chapter we see harry again ten years later it s dudley s birthday and his parents want to take him to the zoo however they can t find harry a place to stay no matter they take harry with them bad things start happening however when the glass enclosure keeping a boa constrictor disappears and mr dursley thinks harry responsible thoughts from u/wither_fire yay we finally get to harry s pov j k rowling makes a point how harry is really fast maybe this shows that he's athletic or maybe fast on a broom since i'm a fast runner does that mean that i would be good on a broom how would this work if it's not at all connected then why would the author bring it up she doesn't use it later in the story in this chapter mr dursley threatens harry about how he won t feed him for months on end he makes him room in a cupboard under the stairs with spiders shivers harry is practically their slaves dudley hits him on a regular basis couldn t harry contact cps this has to count for abuse in some way i hope yvonne is having a nice vacation in majorca in chamber of secrets don t the dursley s want to buy a holiday home in majorca maybe that s why she and petunia are friends what other reason could they be friends who would want to be friends with petunia why does dudley want to buy a racing bike if he hates physical activity then what s the point is the only reason being that he wants to show it off does he want to run harry over so many unanswered questions i forgot that aunt marge was introduced so early on the books says that she bought dudley a present and yet hates harry so i suppose that that s accurate why would the dursley s buy their son a gold watch the remote controlled airplane i understand i could even see the bike but why would an eleven/twelve year old boy want a gold watch only to show it off is that it dudley can t do basic addition or subtraction how did he even get to grade six are his parents that persuasive he looked like a pig in a wig good one why does petunia even bother in getting harry s hair cut she doesn t try with the rest of her appearance people like to pick on how harry doesn t get the obvious clues that he might be different i think this is realistic if some serious stuff was happening to me i would never come to the conclusion that i was a wizard like harry i would make the excuse that the reason i ended up on the roof was because of the wind what other logical reason could there be later on in the series mrs figg reveals that she was boring to harry on purpose but to what extent did she purposely make stale cake did she make her house smell like cabbage just for harry s visits and what about the cats did she only get a lot cats so she could list off their names

about them serious,"Harry Potter Reread: Philosopher's Stone: Chapter 2, The Vanishing Glass Wow. So I failed last yesterday night. I made so many mistakes... And that's a *good* thing! It shows that I truly desperately need a reread of the series! Or that I was really tired last night. Either or. Because of this, I will be adding a new section for fixing my mistakes (and yes, I made a lot of them). Thanks so much guys on correcting me, I made a lot of truly awful mistakes.  I won't be fixing them, either. This is going to remain a faithful record of my sixteen cringey self.  **Mistakes I made from the last chapter:**  * There are other POV in the series besides Vernon. I cannot believe I made that error. How could I forget Frank Bryce, or even the Minister of Magic. My friends would be ashamed of me. Heck, I'm ashamed of me too. * The timeline in which Sirius gives Hagrid the motorcycle. What I said was wrong, and the details are covered in Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. He gives Hagrid the motorcycle when he learns of James and Lily's passing, and before he 'kills' Peter Pettigrew. This is another stupid mistake on my behalf. * Dedalus Diggle doesn't die! However, there was attempted murder, so I at least remember *something*. While there were many of you who corrected me (thanks again), I'd like to thank u/om_1990 especially for his great on point answers.  **Book:** Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, British Version  **Chapter:** 2, The Vanishing Glass  **Synopsis:** In this chapter, we see Harry again ten years later. It’s Dudley’s birthday, and his parents want to take him to the zoo! However, they can’t find Harry a place to stay. No matter, they take Harry with them. Bad things start happening, however, when the glass enclosure keeping a boa constrictor disappears... And Mr. Dursley thinks Harry responsible.  **Thoughts from** u/Wither_Fire**:**  * Yay! We finally get to Harry’s POV. * J.K. Rowling makes a point how Harry is really fast. Maybe this shows that he's athletic, or maybe fast on a broom. Since I'm a fast runner, does that mean that I would be good on a broom? How would this work? If it's not at all connected, then why would the author bring it up? She doesn't use it later in the story... * In this chapter Mr. Dursley threatens Harry about how he won’t feed him for months on end. He makes him room in a cupboard under the stairs (with spiders [*shivers*]). Harry is practically their slaves. Dudley hits him on a regular basis. Couldn’t Harry contact CPS? This has to count for abuse in some way... * I hope Yvonne is having a nice vacation in Majorca. In Chamber of Secrets, don’t the Dursley’s want to buy a holiday home in Majorca? Maybe that’s why she and Petunia are friends... What other reason could they be friends? Who would want to be friends with Petunia? * Why does Dudley want to buy a racing bike? If he hates physical activity, then what’s the point? Is the only reason being that he wants to show it off? Does he want to run Harry over? So many unanswered questions... * I forgot that Aunt Marge was introduced so early on. The books says that she bought Dudley a present and yet hates Harry, so I suppose that that’s accurate. * Why would the Dursley’s buy their son a gold watch? The remote controlled airplane, I understand. I could even see the bike. But why would an eleven/twelve year old boy want a gold watch? Only to show it off? Is that it? * Dudley can’t do basic addition or subtraction. How did he even get to grade six? Are his parents *that* persuasive? * “He looked like a pig in a wig” good one. *  Why does Petunia even bother in getting Harry’s hair cut? She doesn’t try with the rest of her appearance. * People like to pick on how Harry doesn’t get the obvious clues that he might be different. I think this is realistic. If some serious stuff was happening to me, I would never come to the conclusion that I was a wizard. Like Harry, I would make the excuse that the reason I ended up on the roof was because of the wind. What other logical reason could there be? * Later on in the series, Mrs. Figg reveals that she was boring to Harry on purpose. But to what extent? Did she purposely make stale cake? Did she make her house smell like cabbage just for Harry’s visits? And what about the cats? Did she only get a lot cats so she could list off their names? Did she choose ridiculous names on purpose? DOES SHE EVEN LIKE CATS? Mr. Sprinkles and I need to know. What about her leg? Did she break that on purpose too? HUH?!  * I never caught that the reason Harry thinks that the mysterious people disappear before he can further meet them is because they dissaparate! * Another thing that I think that the movie did better, is the actual part where the glass breaks. In the book, Dudley and Piers just fall backwards. In the movie, Dudley falls into the enclosure, and then becomes trapped when the glass reappears. People just don’t give the movies enough credit. I’m also missing Dudley’s “BUT LAST YEAR LAST YEAR I GOT 37. I DON’T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE.”  All in all, another iconic chapter. Did I make any other obvious errors? Please tell me all about them. Seriously!"

So in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry uses parselmouth. First with Justin Finch-Fletchley. When he does everybody can hear him.  However, he can hear the Basilisk speak, but nobody he’s with e.g Ron and Hermione hears hissing or any snake like sounds right?  In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Bartholdi Bagshot uses Parselmouth but Hermione doesn’t hear anything. When Ron uses Parselmouth she does hear him.   Now my question is, can other people hear Parselmouth? It seems to sort of change whether they can, and I’m mainly bogged by the Basilisk. If Harry can hear him loud and clear, shouldn’t Ron and Hermione hear hissing?"

3779,credence s true identity and how it doesn t even add up with the first fantastic beasts spoilers let s remember the events of fbawtft and try to tie them to this final plot twist aurelius dumbledore evidence  in the first movie grindelwald or graves was looking for a child he didn t even know the child s age or gender let s remember he even believed the obscurial was credence s sister the little blond girl modesty how could he have believed even one second that modesty could be aurelius aurelius is a male name and modesty a girl is ten years younger than credence evidence  he had credence under his nose knew he was a wizard with unknown parents yet he didn t do the math and told himself oh maybe this boy is aurelius dumbledore no because the only thing that mattered to him was the obscurus the dark parasite not the obscurial the carrier of it it didn t matter if the obscurus was a girl a boy a child or a teenager to make short at this point the identity of the obscurial didn t matter conclusion he wasn t looking for aurelius dumbledore but for an obscurus in the first movie so two options now between the two movies grindelwald learned the true identity of credence which is very convenient and convoluted waw the obscurus i was looking for is also albus brother what a coincidence second option he was lying to credence during the last scene in fact we can be sure that grindelwald was partially lying since he said your own brother wants to destroy you we know dumbledore doesn t want to destroy him and he is the one who told newt that credence is leta s brother so dumbledore doesn t even know that credence is his brother was grindelwald lying about the rest probably it s not the first time he lies to credence playing on his deepest desire remember in fb1 he was an abused boy who was looking for love then grindelwald was like you are special you are going to be a wizard you matters acting all touchy touchy because he needed someone to find the child then grindelwald thought he achieved his goal left credence behind and told him he didn t know who his parents were he was nothing special and was probably a squib all his promises were lie it s the same pattern here what is credence s greatest desire during the movie finding his family how convenient for grindelwald to suddenly be like i know how you parents are and albus dumbledore your brother wants to kill you grindelwald needs a weapon against dumbledore and an obscurial is the perfect one probably because of ariana credence is foolish and angry right now no wizards in their right mind would attack dumbledore but since he isn t really part of the magic community he doesn t fear him so he is going to do it proof grindelwald told his partisans when they asked him why credence mattered so much if i ask you to go to hogwarts and kill dumbledore would you do it no they wouldn t because they aren t suicidal i m sure if modesty was revealed to be the obscurial in the first movie then grindelwald would have been modesty your true name is adela dumbledore and your brother wants to kill you random thought there is like  years between dumbledore and credence was kendra still fertile to give birth to another son it s canon that percival went to azkaban in  i don t know if it s possible to conceive a child in azkaban because credence doesn t look to be  years old what about the phoenix then grindelwald catch or buy a phoenix maybe the phoenix was with him all along and stolen from the dumbledore during his youth he waits for the phoenix to die and resurrect as a chick he knows where credence was living in paris so he put the phoenix under his window at night and voilà the trick is done,credenc s true ident and how it doesn t even add up with the first fantast beast

with him all along and stolen from the dumbledor dure hi youth he wait for the phoenix to die and resurrect as a chick he know where credenc wa live in pari so he put the phoenix under hi window at night and voilà the trick is done,"Credence’s true identity and how it doesn’t even add up with the first Fantastic Beasts (SPOILERS). Let’s remember the events of FBAWTFT and try to tie them to this final plot twist, “Aurelius Dumbledore”:  - Evidence 1: In the first movie, Grindelwald (or Graves) was looking for a “child”. He didn’t even know the child’s age or gender. Let’s remember, he even believed the Obscurial was “Credence’s sister”, the little blond girl, Modesty. How could he have believed, even one second, that Modesty could be Aurelius? Aurelius is a male name and Modesty, a girl, is ten years younger than Credence.   - Evidence 2 : He had Credence under his nose, knew he was a wizard with unknown parents. Yet he didn’t do the math and told himself “Oh maybe this boy is Aurelius Dumbledore?”  - No because, the only thing that mattered to him was the Obscurus (the dark parasite), not the Obscurial (the carrier of it). It didn’t matter if the Obscurus was a girl, a boy, a child or a teenager. To make short, at this point, the identity of the Obscurial didn’t matter.   - Conclusion : he wasn’t looking for Aurelius Dumbledore but for an Obscurus in the first movie.   So two options now :  - Between the two movies , Grindelwald learned the “true identity” of Credence which is very convenient and convoluted. (Waw the Obscurus I was looking for is also Albus brother! What a coincidence!).  - Second option, he was lying to Credence during the last scene.   - In fact, we can be sure that Grindelwald was partially lying since he said “your own brother wants to destroy you”. We know Dumbledore doesn’t want to destroy him and he is the one who told Newt that Credence is Leta’s brother. So Dumbledore doesn’t even know that Credence is “his brother”.   - Was Grindelwald lying about the rest? Probably.   - It’s not the first time, he lies to Credence, playing on his deepest desire. Remember? In FB1, he was an abused boy who was looking for love. Then Grindelwald was like “You are special” “You are going to be a wizard” “You matters” acting all touchy touchy because he needed someone to find the “child”. Then, Grindelwald thought he achieved his goal, left Credence behind and told him he didn’t know who his parents were, he was nothing special and was probably a Squib. All his promises were lie.   - It’s the same pattern here. What is Credence’s greatest desire during the movie? Finding his family. How convenient for Grindelwald to suddenly be like “I know how you parents are and Albus Dumbledore, your brother, wants to kill you.” Grindelwald needs a weapon against Dumbledore and an Obscurial is the perfect one (probably because of Ariana). Credence is foolish and angry right now, no wizards in their right mind would attack Dumbledore but since he isn’t really part of the magic community, he doesn’t fear him, so he is going to do it.   - Proof : Grindelwald told his partisans when they asked him why Credence mattered so much. “If I ask you to go to Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore, would you do it?” No they wouldn’t because they aren’t suicidal.   - I’m sure if Modesty was revealed to be the Obscurial in the first movie then Grindelwald would have been “Modesty, your true name is Adela Dumbledore and your brother wants to kill you”.  Random thought:   - There is like 25 years between Dumbledore and Credence, was Kendra still fertile to give birth to another son?   - It’s canon that Percival went to Azkaban in 1891. I don’t know if it’s possible to conceive a child in Azkaban because Credence doesn’t look to be 36 years old.   - What about the Phoenix then? Grindelwald catch or buy a Phoenix. Maybe the Phoenix was with him all along and stolen from the Dumbledore during his youth. He waits for the Phoenix to die and resurrect as a chick. He knows where Credence was living in Paris, so he put the Phoenix under his window at night and voilà, the trick is done."

A lot of the issues with the last season have stemmed from questionable storytelling decisions in past seasons.

This is an art processing \(rendering\) of photos. ](https://i.redd.it/gp617mqr3fu21.jpg)  [I personally count this art as my best from all! I DO love animals a lot and that is what makes me and Newt alike... The motto of this illustration is \\""You never met a monster you couldn't love\\"" phrase by Leta in trailer. I think this words describes Newt's love best! Given what dark times are coming in the history of the magic world, we all need bright colors! That is why I decided to put all new beasts, shown to us in the trailer and promo, together at one poster. I really liked the contrast between the disturbing reality and the bright, pure world of Newt's deep love for his creatures in the first film. Among the gray streets, witch hunters, wars and future tragedies, the journey to Newt's suitcase becomes a real breath of clean air, pure magic! You can see such beasts here: Nagini, Thestral, ZouWu, Kelpie, Leucrotta, Augurey, Matagot, Bowtruckle, Chupakabra and baby Niffler. Also before I saw the film I supposed that Newt was using Appaloosa Puffskein to calm Zouwu down, so at the art Newt is holding it with LeviOsa to distruct beast's attention from all others, but Kelpie is still nervous about this huge lion-like creature :-\)  ](https://i.redd.it/yajpc2sr3fu21.png)  Thank you so much for your time! Hope, you loved the post! &lt;3"

So I know the title makes absolutely no sense at first, but bear with me here. This has been bothering me for a while.  So Pottermore, a couple months ago, tweeted that wizards, back in the days of old, ""wizards simply relieved themselves where they stood and vanished the evidence.""  I'm sure you all heard it. It was, after all, crucial information in building the Wizarding World's canon.  So how does this relate to Hogwarts? Well, according to Pottermore, Hogwarts was founded some time in the 10th century, well before the advent of modern plumbing in the late 18th century. Pottermore states that modern plumbing wasn't implemented until muggles invented it, which means it's unlikely the Founders were ahead of their time in that particular regard.  This means that the girl's restroom which houses the Chamber was either  A. Originally a girl's bathroom (Slytherin, you dog), and later renovated to add sinks and toilets and the like. Or. B. Not a bathroom at all and made into one at a later date with sinks and toilets and the like.  Seeing as the basilisk ran through pipes hidden throughout the school, I find it difficult to believe that anybody or any crew could renovate and tear apart an entire room without finding the Chamber beforehand.   So what gives?   If wizards doodoo'ed on the floor, how did the chamber remain secret?? These are the hard hitting questions that need answering!  P.S. I like to imagine a magical construction crew of exclusively parselmouths (preferably named Parselmouth Plumbers) that discovered the Chamber and never told anybody. And maybe one of them carved that little snake on the sink.  Or, y'know, Wizards didn't poopookaka on the floor.  Thoughts?"

Also this is just an opinion but I feel that Dumbledore knew that the secret keeper was changed to Sirius but still didn’t say anything. But of course that is just an opinion.

Okay, once again **MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!!** If you haven't watched the movie go watch it before you read further, because these are probably the biggest spoilers you could ever hear for something Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts related, except for maybe Half-Blood Prince spoilers. So yeah...you've been warned. Now let's get started! Okay first of all, the beginning! When Grindlewald tricked the MACUSA employees, wow! I was like in my seat in the theater trying not explode! That was the moment when I realized that I was gonna love this movie more than the original one. Second thing, Newt has a BROTHER? Wow... Okay enough about that, more about young Dumbledore! I'm so used to seeing old Dumbledore with white hair and glasses. But, young Dumbledore is like, wow! He's so cool, handsome, basically the wizard anyone and everyone would want to date! Then like he tells Newt to go to Paris, and I'm just like wha...ya know Newt has a travel ban, right? Can't you go yourself? You don't have a travel ban! But, like we do find out why later in the movie so...it's fine. Then we see Newt's basement like wow! It's so amazing! The baby nifflers though so cute! Last but not least, Queenie!!! She so shouldn't have put the spell on Jacob! She really should've let him choose! Whelp, come back later for the other parts! Bye!"

For the first couple of books all fat characters appear to be stupid: uncle Vernon and Dudley, Crabbe and Goyle, Millicent, later as far as I recall Umbridge... also Nevill and Hagrid, mentioned in previous topic (though I wouldn't call Hagrid fat, he is just large). On contrary, Harry, Hermoine, Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Malfoys... Good or bad, they are smart.  Most exception are dump but handsome Lockhart, but he is chained to his prince-charming-type, and maybe Petunia. What do you think?"

First and foremost, location helps. At Alamo, they had a string quartet playing songs from the movies and the 1920’s. We saw amazing cosplayers and you could feel the energy in the theatre once we filed in.  I felt it started strong but my wife said she didn’t follow the carriage scene well. Now knowing the ending, I’m curious why GG has the blood pact to begin with.  I enjoyed enchanted Jacob. Bravo to the actor for making me believe it without question.  I understand it has to touch all fans but the Leta/Newt/Tina thing didn’t grab me much UNTIL I questioned if Leta’s last words were, in fact, directed at Newt.  Some absolutely amazing lines, incredible creatures and I’m thankful they didn’t try to overdue it with the baby nifflers. They were there, they were cute and we got to move on.  I was blown away by Jude Law and Johnny Depp! They each performed brilliantly and sold me on their characters 100%!  Queenie broke my heart, but we can hold out for the imperious curse or something in the tea since it was being so pushy.  GG is such a good liar that we almost believe him at the end but I’m holding out and disagree  My one bone to pick although I absolutely loved watching McGonagall, are we going to skip over the fact that she wasn’t born until 1935???"

1947,gryffindor is actually an underrated house i know that you're thinking wait isn't that the house of the golden trio and just about every main character we are introduced to in the books the thing is though gryffindor actually seems to be more underrated in real life when compared to other houses for example whenever people are asked what their house is you will mostly hear slytherin cause they got a bad rap and there's more to them than just evil they are also cunning and ambitious or hufflepuff cause they're more than just the 'nice' house i actually hear more about hufflepuff now than years ago when it was the house noone wanted to be in ravenclaw has people but to a lesser extent when compared with the more vocal hufflepuffs and slytherins ravenclaws are also underrated but that's an entirely different story gryffindor on the other hand is a house noone seems to want to be in anymore at least from what i see nowadays whenever people think of gryffindor they think oh you're just a gryffindor because harry ron and hermione were there it's like being a gryffindor is forbidden because when people think gryffindor they think 'brave' when there's more to it gryffindor is also valiant chivalrous and practical overall it seems to fall into the it's so popular it's uncool to be in there mentality these days and it's a downright shame if you ask me,gryffindor is actual an underr hous i know that you'r think wait isn't that the hous of the golden trio and just about everi main charact we are introduc to in the book the thing is though gryffindor actual seem to be more underr in real life when compar to other hous for exampl whenev peopl are ask what their hous is you will mostli hear slytherin caus they got a bad rap and there' more to them than just evil they are also cun and ambiti or hufflepuff caus they'r more than just the 'nice' hous i actual hear more about hufflepuff now than year ago when it wa the hous noon want to be in ravenclaw ha peopl but to a lesser extent when compar with the more vocal hufflepuff and slytherin ravenclaw are also underr but that' an entir differ stori gryffindor on the other hand is a hous noon seem to want to be in anymor at least from what i see nowaday whenev peopl think of gryffindor they think oh you'r just a gryffindor becaus harri ron and hermion were there it' like be a gryffindor is forbidden becaus when peopl think gryffindor they think 'brave' when there' more to it gryffindor is also valiant chivalr and practic overal it seem to fall into the it' so popular it' uncool to be in there mental these day and it' a downright shame if you ask me,gryffindor is actual an underr hous i know that you'r think wait isn't that the hous of the golden trio and just about everi main charact we are introduc to in the book the thing is though gryffindor actual seem to be more underr in real life when compar to other hous for exampl whenev peopl are ask what their hous is you will mostli hear slytherin caus they got a bad rap and there' more to them than just evil they are also cun and ambiti or hufflepuff caus they'r more than just the 'nice' hous i actual hear more about hufflepuff now than year ago when it wa the hous noon want to be in ravenclaw ha peopl but to a lesser extent when compar with the more vocal hufflepuff and slytherin ravenclaw are also underr but that' an entir differ stori gryffindor on the other hand is a hous noon seem to want to be in anymor at least from what i see nowaday whenev peopl think of gryffindor they think oh you'r just a gryffindor becaus harri ron and hermion were there it' like be a gryffindor is forbidden becaus when peopl think gryffindor they think 'brave' when there' more to it gryffindor is also valiant chivalr and practic overal it seem to fall into the it' so popular it' uncool to be in there mental these day and it' a downright shame if you ask me,"Gryffindor is actually an underrated house I know that you're thinking ""Wait...isn't that the house of the Golden Trio, and just about every main character we are introduced to in the books?"" The thing is, though, Gryffindor actually seems to be more underrated in real life when compared to other houses.  For example, whenever people are asked what their house is, you will mostly hear Slytherin, cause they got a bad rap and there's more to them than just evil. They are also cunning and ambitious. Or Hufflepuff, cause they're more than just the 'nice' house. I actually hear more about Hufflepuff now than years ago, when it was the house noone wanted to be in. Ravenclaw has people, but to a lesser extent when compared with the more vocal Hufflepuffs and Slytherins. (Ravenclaws are also underrated, but that's an entirely different story).  Gryffindor, on the other hand, is a house noone seems to want to be in anymore-- at least, from what I see nowadays. Whenever people think of Gryffindor, they think ""Oh, you're just a Gryffindor because Harry, Ron, and Hermione were there."" It's like being a Gryffindor is forbidden, because when people think Gryffindor they think 'brave', when there's more to it. Gryffindor is also valiant, chivalrous, and practical.   Overall, it seems to fall into the ""it's so popular, it's uncool to be in there"" mentality these days, and it's a downright shame if you ask me."

2466,why do people think harry is unintelligent the idea that harry isn't very intelligent seems to crop up again and again in posts i've never understood it nor have i ever been convinced by the reasons people bring up for instance of the things i hear most often is that harry's decision to not open the package sirius gave him was stupid but his motivation is pretty much spelled out he does it to protect sirius which given that he knows sirius' recklessness and wants to keep the father figure he now finally has is quite understandable harry has definitely made some stupid decisions but there's a difference in an action being stupid and a person being stupid all intelligent people do stupid things sometimes what i wonder about is whether people who consider harry unintelligent ever look beneath the surface and look at the whole picture i also wonder whether they don't tend to exaggerate things some people act as if harry never did his homework for instance i'm honestly curious what people's arguments are i'll explain my own position as well i feel that harry's intelligence is easily above average he's not so much emotionally intelligent and not booksmart but learns easily from experience in my view he's proven himself to be intelligent over and over again and i'll give a few examples he's a reasonably good student he passes each year with good grades the exception being divination for obvious reasons in ootp when told he'll need to put in some hard work if he wants to become an auror he ends up getting pretty impressive grades especially potions this shows that while he often doesn't have the motivation for academics he does have the intelligence to succeed if he applies himself while he's not booksmart he picks up new spells quickly through practice learning the patronus charm poa he's a quick thinker pretending to the bloody baron to get rid of peeves in ps leading hermione through the time travel bit in poa like warning her to get out moony's

The screenplay had flaws (for reasons mentioned above) but everything else (cinematography, music, acting etc.) is done amazingly.  The child actors are pretty great for their age and mature in every film and the adults are some of the world’s greatest actors. But I want to give special shoutout to Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) and Alfonso Cuarón (Prisoner of Azkaban). Ralph gives one of the most amazing performances I’ve ever seen and Alfonso has created a masterpiece and set the bar for future Harry Potter films."

Let me put my point forth through the example of Snape.If the Sorting Hat put him in Gryffindor,with Lily,he would have had different peers and no future Death Eaters as friends.He would have almost definitely befriended the Marauders at some point in time.He would not incline towards the Dark Arts,as the Marauders and Lily would just talk him out of it.He would have then married Lily,although I think they would meet the same sticky end as James-Lily met.But in the end,both of them would have lived a happy and content life,and our protagonist would have been named Harry Snape('Harry Snape' sounds worse when you say it out loud.).  One exception,of course,would be Voldy.Even if he would have been in Gryffindor or Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff,he would have still turned into one of the most dangerous wizards of all time.  My core point is,the Sorting Hat should have foreseen the possibilities,and should have sorted students who were borderline inclined towards the Dark Arts, into a house with people who would change their attitude.  I am not saying that the Slytherin House should be deserted.In fact,many people would actually benefit from being in Slytherin,particularly those who are resourceful and cunning.  Any thoughts are welcome!"

3967,the right kind of rebel theory part  hi there in the next movie as i said before newt may be tested if he is willing to object all orders for the true greater good and i m pretty convinced that tina will face a similar journey warning a lot of discussing circus arcanus in the middle enjoy whether or not i m right about that she travels to paris with queenie to find credence there s no doubt that once she knows he s in the city she ll stop at nothing to contact him though he may mistrust her due to the past events there is no way she will give up on him or obey any law once he s under her protection but this will not be the only obstacle _______________________________________________________ circus arcanus we know she starts working with yusuf kama while in paris and they visit circus arcanus together which will have an impact on her we know tina s relation to humans how will she react to whatever his happening to the freaks in the show we ve seen her face briefly during the first look a disturbed expression in the middle of a pretty loud audience kama seemed a little stunned as well when getting a view whatever the circus presents it doesn t apply well to some people i do wonder what they see actual freak shows sadly often featured staff purposely injuring the presented humans for entertainment but how does that work with the people in this circus maledictus is advertised as enchanting snake girl suggesting that she is going to dance rather than get hurt the advertised oni could suffer for this kind of show and we know about a character named melusine now who could be a sort of waterfairy/shape shifting mermaid who is presented to the audience and forced to swim around in a tank/do tricks maybe shortly lifted out of the water magically for the audience to get a better view which likely is not going to react enchanted to all that is shown i still wonder how credence fits into all of this he is likely more informed about his condition now and has survived an attack by several aurors though not necessarily without a single scratch how can he be controlled what is his part in the show they can t show his face while performing since his survival may be passed on to the macusa so may perform invisibly lifting the performers up and showing them around while staying in the show for alike reasons i m pretty convinced most of the freaks left or were given to the circus by their families and suffer from a magical condition that makes it impossible for them to lead a normal life which may be something they tell tina when she tries to talk to them about their life also they most likely have formed close relationships with each other over time though credence would have a chance if he got a wand and was allowed to practise/lower his magic i m sure he cannot leave the circus just like that either partly because for having nowhere to go as well and partly for not wanting to leave maledictus behind i kind of have the feeling that skender knows neither him nor the the others are going to leave on their own accord and abuses this fact though he cannot mistreat him too badly out of fear of another obscurial outbreak my point is considering that the people at the circus could have legit reasons to stay he wouldn t have to break the law and put an imperius curse on them though what is happening in this circus is i m convinced anything but human and tina is going to remember it in the end i don t think she will end the circus entirely but skender s rule over it she may fight him alongside creed and maledictus or maybe all alone and hand him over to authorities maybe he has some secrets that lead to a prison sentence of a few years before leaving the circus remaining staff after the leaked attack scene with carrying on with the show the way they feel comfortable and staying together but we may see another situation with other horrors tina has to face _______________________________________________________________________________________ the brothel in the list linked on the leaky cauldron about future scenes a scenerie involving prostitutes was mentioned which brings me back to the possibility of an imperius curse being used to keep people in check unfortunately it is very possible that some wizards use this curse to force magic and non magic people into prostitution and as we know barty crouch was subdued to this curse and noone was able to tell whyever the go to a brothel possibly run by such a wizard tina may react in a similar way as to the freak show though this time this may actually end in her freeing all the captives i still have to wrap my mind around what role the brothel could play in this story but it could be used to show another step in tina s journey maybe one in which she actively fight an oppressor once again so all in all tina may get the chance to stand up for others once again i m not sure if she will break the law/statute of secrecy again but if she does maybe she ll stop minding the macusa may decide that her spirit can be of great use in the upcoming war and if they do fire her maybe the british

kind of rebel (Theory, part 2) Hi there :)  In the next movie, as I said before, Newt may be tested if he is willing to object all orders for the (true) greater good… and I’m pretty convinced that Tina will face a similar journey … (warning: a lot of discussing Circus Arcanus in the middle)…  enjoy 😊  Whether or not I’m right about that she travels to Paris with Queenie to find Credence, there’s no doubt that once she knows he’s in the city, she’ll stop at nothing to contact him. Though he may mistrust her due to the past events, there is no way she will give up on him, or obey any law once he’s under her protection.   But this will not be the only obstacle…  _______________________________________________________-   **Circus Arcanus**  We know she starts working with Yusuf Kama while in Paris, and they visit Circus Arcanus together – which will have an impact on her. We know Tina’s relation to humans … how will she react to whatever his happening to the freaks in the show?  We’ve seen her face briefly during the first look – a disturbed expression in the middle of a pretty loud audience.  Kama seemed a little stunned as well when getting a view … whatever the circus presents, it doesn’t apply well to some people.  I do wonder what they see… actual freak shows, sadly, often featured staff purposely injuring the presented humans for entertainment … but how does that work with the people in this circus? Maledictus is advertised as “enchanting snake-girl”, suggesting that she is going to dance rather than get hurt… the advertised “Oni” could suffer for this kind of show… and we know about a character named “Melusine” now, who could be a sort of waterfairy/shape-shifting mermaid, who is presented to the audience and forced to swim around in a tank/do tricks… maybe shortly lifted out of the water magically for the audience to get a better view… which likely is not going to react enchanted to all that is shown.  I still wonder how Credence fits into all of this … he is likely more informed about his condition now, and has survived an attack by several aurors (though not necessarily) without a single scratch. How can he be controlled? What is his part in the show?  They can’t show his face while performing, since his survival may be passed on to the MACUSA, so may perform invisibly, lifting the performers up and showing them around. While staying in the show for alike reasons.  I’m pretty convinced most of the freaks left or were given to the circus by their families, and suffer from a magical condition that makes it impossible for them to lead a normal life, which may be something they tell Tina when she tries to talk to them about their life. Also, they most likely have formed close relationships with each other over time.  Though Credence would have a chance if he got a wand and was allowed to practise/lower his magic, I’m sure he cannot leave the circus just like that either, partly because for having nowhere to go as well and partly for not wanting to leave Maledictus behind.    I kind of have the feeling that Skender knows neither him nor the the others are going to leave on their own accord, and abuses this fact – though he cannot mistreat him too badly out of fear of another obscurial outbreak… my point is, considering that the people at the circus could have legit reasons to stay, he wouldn’t have to break the law and put an imperius curse on them.  Though what is happening in this circus is, I’m convinced, anything but human and Tina is going to remember it. In the end, I don’t think she will end the circus entirely – but Skender’s rule over it.  She may fight him alongside Creed and Maledictus, or maybe all alone 😊 and hand him over to authorities (maybe he has some secrets that lead to a prison sentence of a few years) before leaving the circus’ remaining staff (after the leaked attack scene) with carrying on with the show the way they feel comfortable – and staying together.  But we may see another situation with other horrors Tina has to face.  _______________________________________________________________________________________   **The Brothel**  In the list linked on “The Leaky Cauldron” about future scenes, a scenerie involving prostitutes was mentioned – which brings me back to the possibility of an imperius curse being used to keep people in check.  Unfortunately, it is very possible that some wizards use this curse to force magic and non-magic people into prostitution … and as we know, Barty Crouch was subdued to this curse and noone was able to tell.  Whyever the go to a brothel possibly run by such a wizard, Tina may react in a similar way as to the freak show – though this time this may actually end in her freeing all the captives.  I still have to wrap my mind around what role the brothel could play in this story – but it could be used to show another step in Tina’s journey, maybe one in which she actively fight an oppressor once again.  So, all in all, Tina may get the chance to stand up for others once again. I’m not sure if she will break the law/statute of secrecy again, but if she does… maybe she’ll stop minding.  The MACUSA may decide that her spirit can be of great use in the upcoming war. And if they do fire her … maybe the british ministry will :)  _______________________________________________________________   Anyway, that’s all for now :) Please let me know if you have something to add :)  Thank you very much for reading :)"

I always thought it was pretty funny how in POA Ron and Harry, who in the past two books show that they are always willing to get to the bottom of a mystery, always wanting to follow the clues to the answer, completely dismiss Hermione’s impossible class schedule!  There are a few references throughout the book (Ron seems to be the one to bring it up the most) talking about how on earth Hermione can be attending two classes at the same time, or how she’s able to handle all of her schoolwork. But every time it’s brought up, they essentially shrug their shoulders and go “meh. Not my business.”  I totally get how this works for the story, I just always found it funny how the first two books set up Harry and Ron (and Hermione of course) as these “investigators” or “detectives” who can’t let a mystery pass them by without doing everything they can to solve it, and then when something REALLY FUCKING INTERESTING is going on with their BEST FRIEND of two years, they treat it like a vaguely interesting piece of trivia.

3290,spoiler theory queenie is snape   hello everybody after seeing fantastic beasts the crimes of grindelwald  times i got out of the theater this last time convinced that queenie is snape   and abernathy is the key to understanding the behavior of queenie and tina in this film abernathy was supervisor of the goldstein sisters at macusa in new york and he was responsible for their activities and knowing their whereabouts how could the goldstein sisters not have noticed their boss at macusa behaving strangely and then disappearing altogether to serve grindelwald it doesn't appear to be explained in the screenplay this is especially curious as in the previous film queenie is shown apparently reading abernathy's mind and manipulating him as she is carrying the suitcase with tina and newt inside so here's the theory once abernathy started acting strange and finally disappeared in order to serve grindelwald and take his place in prison tina and queenie caught on to what was happening queenie could hear everything that was going on in abernathy s head and therefore she and her sister knew more than most others about grindelwald s plan and perhaps how creedance was a part of it when the escape happened the sisters hatched a plan to go to paris to find creedence save him from being killed by aurors from the ministries of several countries and also subtly work against grindelwald along the way the sisters planned to enlist the help of newt scamander and by association dumbledore s help as well it's also important to note that tina and queenie gained new knowledge by becoming friends with newt scamander tina was present at newt s interrogation at macusa so she knows he wasn't really in new york for appaloosa puffskins or even his thunderbird frank it was mostly a cover story for his mission on behalf of dumbledore so following newt's example the sisters develop their own cover story for their trip to europe tina going to paris as her auror self seeking out creedance as she always has and as grindelwald would fully expect her to queenie travelling to england on the pretense of marrying jacob but really to recruit newt scamander to help them queenie left the torn up paris postcard in the london house for newt to find so that he could join the sisters in their mission in paris it seems like too much of a coincidence in paris when queenie enters the ministry just after rosier and her former boss abernathy in fact as queenie asks very awkwardly and obviously at the ministry where her sister is she spills her suitcase just as vinda rosier and abernathy walk past queenie should have been able to hear their thoughts and immediately should have recognised her former macusa boss with or without his polyjuice potion disguise things appear to have gone a little haywire however when queenie drank the tea at grindelwald's hideout and came under his manipulative influence i really believe along with a few others here that in the next films queenie will mirror severus snape she will stay close to creedance/aurelius to protect him and use her skills in legillimancy and occulancy to undermine grindelwald's plans what do you guys think does

Theory: Queenie is Snape 2.0? Hello everybody!  After seeing Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald 3 times, I got out of the theater this last time convinced that **Queenie is Snape 2.0**, and **Abernathy is the key** to understanding the behavior of Queenie and Tina in this film...  & #   Abernathy was supervisor of the Goldstein sisters at MACUSA in New York, and he was responsible for their activities and knowing their whereabouts.  How could the Goldstein sisters *not* have noticed their boss at MACUSA behaving strangely and then disappearing altogether to serve Grindelwald? It doesn't appear to be explained in the screenplay.  This is especially curious, as in the previous film Queenie is shown apparently reading Abernathy's mind and manipulating him as she is carrying the suitcase with Tina and Newt inside...  & #   **So here's the theory:**  Once Abernathy started acting strange and finally disappeared in order to serve Grindelwald and take his place in prison, Tina and Queenie caught on to what was happening.  Queenie could hear everything that was going on in Abernathy’s head, and therefore she and her sister knew more than most others about Grindelwald’s plan and perhaps how Creedance was a part of it.  When the escape happened, the sisters hatched a plan to go to Paris to find Creedence, save him from being killed by aurors from the ministries of several countries, and also subtly work against Grindelwald.   Along the way, the sisters planned to enlist the help of Newt Scamander (and by association, Dumbledore’s help as well).  It's also important to note that Tina and Queenie gained new knowledge by becoming friends with Newt Scamander: Tina was present at Newt’s interrogation at MACUSA, so she knows he wasn't really in New York for appaloosa puffskins or even his thunderbird Frank.....it was mostly a cover story for his mission on behalf of Dumbledore.  So, following Newt's example, the sisters develop their own cover story for their trip to Europe:   Tina going to Paris as her Auror self, seeking out Creedance as she always has (and as Grindelwald would fully expect her to). Queenie travelling to England on the pretense of marrying Jacob, but really to recruit Newt Scamander to help them.    Queenie left the torn up Paris postcard in the London house for Newt to find, so that he could join the sisters in their mission in Paris.   It seems like too much of a coincidence in Paris, when Queenie enters the ministry just after Rosier and her former boss Abernathy. In fact, as Queenie asks very awkwardly and obviously at the ministry where her sister is..... she spills her suitcase just as Vinda Rosier and Abernathy walk past. Queenie should have been able to hear their thoughts and immediately should have recognised her former MACUSA boss with or without his polyjuice potion disguise...  Things appear to have gone a little haywire, however, when Queenie ""drank the tea"" at Grindelwald's hideout, and came under his manipulative influence...  & #   I really believe, along with a few others here, that in the next films Queenie will mirror Severus Snape. She will stay close to Creedance/Aurelius to protect him, and use her skills in legillimancy (and occulancy?) to undermine Grindelwald's plans.  & #   What do you guys think? Does this theory with Abernathy make any sense, or could this be a plot hole in the film?  Sorry for any mistakes, this is only my third post on Reddit and I'm still figuring all this out! :)  Your feedback, comments and corrections would be really appreciated!"

Imagine a game where (before any major events of the series) you get to create your own character and explore all the places we have seen or read.  It would be cool to major in potions and be a part of the your house's quidditch team. Over the expansions(DLC) you eventually graduate Hogwarts and choose your path in life.  This determines what kind of adventure you will have and what kind of antagonists you run into.  TLDR: Hopeless wishful thinking.

[SPOILERS] After seeing the movie a few times and beginning the deep dive into connecting all of the threads woven into this story, today I had a thought and I am unsure if this has been discussed elsewhere. I am working out how 3 facts could be connected:  1. When Queenie originally shows up with Jacob at Newt’s house in London she says her and Tina have not been talking because Tina doesn’t approve of her sister dating a no-maj. But Newt finds the postcard sent from Paris that Tina sent to Queenie.  2. When Queenie shows up at the French Ministry there is no record of Tina working with the French Ministry.  3. After Newt &  Tina remove the beast from Yusuf’s eye, Tina tries to dash off from Flamel’s saying she has to get back to the ministry to report her findings.  There is no record of Tina working for the French ministry according to the woman working the entrance, and yet Tina tries to report back to the ministry. Was the woman working the main entrance lying? If Queenie &  Tina weren’t talking, did someone else send the postcard to Queenie? Did Grindelwald send the postcard? Was Roselier (spelling, sorry) retrieving Queenie from the rain intentionally set up by Grindelwald months in advance?  This is all pretty random theorizing on my part but I just keep thinking about the amount of time Grindelwald was impersonating Graves, and how closely he was working with Tina at MACUSA. It would make sense if Grindelwald knew about Queenie’s legillimency."

Magic children tend to magically save themselves at young age in dangerous situations, even if they don't know they are wizards/witches. Harry did that running away from Dudley and the bullies.

This is based off the books not the movie.  So a huge contributing factor for Harry to have fulfilled the role in the prophecy and Voldemort's downfall was the protection given by Lily Potter when she sacrificed herself. It allowed him to be marked as an equal, and it continued to help Harry survive until the end. I thought, at first, it was strange that Harry was the only child/person that had this protection. There had to have been multiple people who gave their lives trying to save loved ones in Voldemort's reign, so why did no one get the protection? Why was Harry the first to get it, and cause a spell to backfire? I think it's because Lily (from the actions of Snape) didn't have to die. Voldemort would have let her live because of Snape. Everyone else was going to die regardless if they tried to sacrifice themselves to save someone else. So, who would have done this for Neville? There was no one in his life who had the option to live like Lily did. I'm sure his parents would have tried to protect him, but regardless, Voldemort would have killed them anyways. How would Neville have survived as a baby to even be ""marked as his equal""? It seems to me, that it's Harry or nobody. Thoughts?"

There is water near the weasleys house because Harry lands in it after being apparated to the cornfields earlier on in this movie. Surely someone at lupins capability had a waterbending spell. And also, when Harry is in the cornfields and is frantically looking around. Surely there is a spell that manipulates air to flatten the corn or perhaps elevate him. Like we learn that wingardium leviosa can lift objects off the ground. And it can’t be that the higher weight of the objects the more magical capability is needed because in movie two and in book two, Ron elevated the trolls club which can’t be that much lighter than Harry. Just needed to get something off my chest. Also, when Harry is trying to butter up slug horn after seeing his and Tom riddles tampered conversation. Harry does a really really really shit job at trying to get info out of slughorn"

It’s explained in HBP that any spell cast in the vicinity of an underage wizard will trigger the trace, and make it appear to the ministry that the underage wizard was the one who cast said spell. A perfect example of this is in COS when Dobby uses a hover charm at Privet Drive and Harry is blamed for it.   So why didn’t the ministry seize every chance they had to make Harry look even worse (that was their goal) by slapping him with multiple charges of underage magic? They could have charged him with the packing spell that Tonks uses in Harry’s bedroom, or the disillusionment charm Moody puts on Harry. Somehow I don’t think they would have bought or approved of Dumbledore saying “Sorry I sent a bunch of Aurors to pick Harry up and they were the ones doing those spells so you can’t charge him for that.” Especially since the Ministry was trying to discredit Dumbledore as well. Plus Dumbledore could’ve just said, “oh yeah that was someone I sent to keep watch over Harry who cast that patronus, it wasn’t actually Harry himself.”  Maybe I’m thinking too much about this but it’s been on my brain for a while. Any insight is welcomed!"

1664,voldemort's downfall i just wanted to point out that as i have already said in another post voldemort is french for death flight which truly does fit voldemort for example he killed harry's parents even though he just wanted to kill harry or even gregorovitch he killed his whole family just to get to him but i just wanted to say if voldemort didn't kill everyone in the vicinity of his target the hp series would have never happened if he just used stupefy on james and lily lily wouldn't have died for harry so he would have never gotten the protective charm from his mother and he would have died,voldemort' downfal i just want to point out that as i have alreadi said in anoth post voldemort is french for death flight which truli doe fit voldemort for exampl he kill harry' parent even though he just want to kill harri or even gregorovitch he kill hi whole famili just to get to him but i just want to say if voldemort didn't kill everyon in the vicin of hi target the hp seri would have never happen if he just use stupefi on jame and lili lili wouldn't have die for harri so he would have never gotten the protect charm from hi mother and he would have die,voldemort' downfal i just want to point out that as i have alreadi said in anoth post voldemort is french for death flight which truli doe fit voldemort for exampl he kill harry' parent even though he just want to kill harri or even gregorovitch he kill hi whole famili just to get to him but i just want to say if voldemort didn't kill everyon in the vicin of hi target the hp seri would have never happen if he just use stupefi on jame and lili lili wouldn't have die for harri so he would have never gotten the protect charm from hi mother and he would have die,"Voldemort's downfall. I just wanted to point out , that as I have already said in another post, ""Voldemort"" is french for ""Death flight"". Which truly does fit Voldemort. For example: He killed Harry's parents, even though he just wanted to kill Harry. Or even Gregorovitch. He killed his whole family just to get to him. But I just wanted to say, if Voldemort didn't kill everyone in the vicinity of his target, the HP series would have never happened. If he just used stupefy on James and Lily, Lily wouldn't have died for Harry, so he would have never gotten the protective charm from his mother, and he would have died."

2571,severus snape doesn't deserve some of the shit he gets warning spoilers also swearing duh okay so i know you might feel inclined to scream at me but please hear me out look we all read the books or should have it's common knowledge snape most definitely killed a lot of people in the time he served voldemort and while i'm well aware that a traumatic childhood doesn't justify being a murderous adult i think we should talk about how unlike potter snape's housemates were actively affiliated with voldemort so you can see how he would feel tempted and even pressured to join the death eaters imagine this you've been abused by your family all your life and the moment you have a chance to get away from that you find yourself getting bullied unceasingly in an extremely cruel way by fellow pupils the only support you have are your housemates who indoctrinate you into a supremacist doctrine which you in your ardent need to feel you belong subscribe to now i'm obviously not justifying murder simply putting into perspective snape's loyalty to the death eaters even more since james potter who viciously and publicly sexually assaulted a defenseless snape along with his other rich and privileged friends doesn't get called out for his bullshit it's not the same thing as murder but one could argue that if it were james being sorted into slytherin especially taken his pureblood status he would most likely had taken a liking to the voldemort rhetoric i have no way of confirming that latter point but i think that it's a logical and rather relevant thought so while you can absolutely complain about the really inadequate way he treated his students whilst he taught at hogwarts i simply can't agree with him being demonized for joining the death eaters truth is that more than

The fourth place goes with a random person of an unknown background to us (16%)  The fifth popular opinion is that Credence is Corvus Lestrange after all (11%).

Is Harry Potter a Dumbledore?  I think Harry Potter will be a Dumbledore.  Seriously.  I think Creedence will actually be a Dumbledore and Lilly will be a  descendant from him. That is why Lilly could use the ancient magic to  protect Harry. That is why the Phoenix burns when Harry first sees it,  and why it comes to his aid when he is in trouble. That is why  Dumbledore acts like a father to Harry.  JK  have shown that she wants to tie the old and new stories together and  doesn't mind changing things along the way. She has also dropped hints  of future twists early on.  What do you think? Is this the way JK is taking the story?"
