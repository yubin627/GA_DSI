1690,the guy who plays amos diggory doesn't get enough credit for how much he stole that scene in gof you all know the one i'm talking about he only has a line or two in it but they couldn't be delivered in a more gut punching manner that's my son that's my boyyyyyy i was very young when i first watched the gof movie and this was the first time i'd ever seen a character react to their child's death on its own the context of the scene would already be extremely depressing but those god damn howls from amos just stick in the brain after the credits roll it's one of those pieces of acting that you learn to appreciate more and more as you get older i think gof has one of the weakest movie adaptations overall but that scene is utterly flawless,the guy who play amo diggori doesn't get enough credit for how much he stole that scene in gof you all know the one i'm talk about he onli ha a line or two in it but they couldn't be deliv in a more gut punch manner that' my son that' my boyyyyyi i wa veri young when i first watch the gof movi and thi wa the first time i'd ever seen a charact react to their child' death on it own the context of the scene would alreadi be extrem depress but those god damn howl from amo just stick in the brain after the credit roll it' one of those piec of act that you learn to appreci more and more as you get older i think gof ha one of the weakest movi adapt overal but that scene is utterli flawless,the guy who play amo diggori doesn't get enough credit for how much he stole that scene in gof you all know the one i'm talk about he onli ha a line or two in it but they couldn't be deliv in a more gut punch manner that' my son that' my boyyyyyi i wa veri young when i first watch the gof movi and thi wa the first time i'd ever seen a charact react to their child' death on it own the context of the scene would alreadi be extrem depress but those god damn howl from amo just stick in the brain after the credit roll it' one of those piec of act that you learn to appreci more and more as you get older i think gof ha one of the weakest movi adapt overal but that scene is utterli flawless,"The guy who plays Amos Diggory doesn't get enough credit for how much he stole that scene in GoF. You all know the one I'm talking about. He only has a line or two in it, but they couldn't be delivered in a more gut punching manner.   ""THAT'S MY SON! THAT'S MY BOYYYYYY!""  I was very young when I first watched the GoF movie and this was the first time I'd ever seen a character react to their child's death. On its own, the context of the scene would already be extremely depressing, but those god damn howls from Amos just stick in the brain after the credits roll. It's one of those pieces of acting that you learn to appreciate more and more as you get older. I think GoF has one of the weakest movie adaptations overall, but that scene is utterly flawless."

[Discussion] I know I’m late to the game on this one, but I literally found a copy discarded on the sidewalk and figured might as well, right?  And on some level I definitely don’t hate it (more akin to the kick i got out of “My Immortal” than to my love of Harry Potter).  I’m sure it’s been said before, but it has some of the best elements of a bad fanfiction by a technically competent writer ~~who has read the first book and maybe seen the movies~~. I’m not going to pay $179 to see it on Broadway, but I’m not mad I read it.   &gt;	⚠️ ***Spoilers below*** ⚠️  I don’t have anything of note to say, but I need to talk to someone about [the exact moment I quit taking it seriously](https://i.imgur.com/K9WiIiS.jpg) (because it has been distracting me from real life for 37 hours and I’ve got shit to do).   From that scene forward, my entire reading of the play was overlaid with an unshakeable mental image:   &gt;	“Fanfic author takes huge bong rip; starts typing like a madman.”  Unrelated, but does anyone who saw the play want to comment on whether Snape seemed like Snape onstage? Because I tried my damnedest and his lines don’t even conjure a bad fanfic version of him in my head."

1838,about to begin my approx  re read anecdotes from my discovery of the series summer always invokes an urge to read the series i've been checking this thread a lot lately so i guess that means it's time to start again it was summer break when i first read philosopher's stone the first film was out but i hadn't seen it so i must have been  when i read ps for the first time i'm thinking  we lived  km outside of town so during the summer we sometimes only went into town for groceries errands once a week so once i had devoured ps in like one day i had nothing left to do but read and re read all my favourite parts diagon alley for a week until i could get to the library for cos poa the scent of grass leaves warm air always stir those good memories after that i was thoroughly obsessed the first  books were out at the time i got obsessed and i read them over and over while i waited what seemed ages for the release of ootp actually it was probably only like a year finally it was released and i had pre ordered it online since we didn't have a bookstore in my town as it turns out the one major grocery store ended up bringing in a skid of ootp so everyone else got their copies before me even though i had pre ordered it man i was so anxious for it to arrive in the mail i kept asking my parents when they got home from work if it had arrived and days went by without any delivery one day

re-read ;) anecdotes from my discovery of the series Summer always invokes an urge to read the series. I've been checking this thread a lot lately, so I guess that means it's time to start again!  & #   It was summer break when I first read Philosopher's Stone. The first film was out but I hadn't seen it, so I must have been 12 when I read PS for the first time (I'm thinking 2002). We lived 25 km outside of town, so during the summer we sometimes only went into town for groceries &  errands once a week. So, once I had devoured PS in like one day, I had nothing left to do but read and re-read all my favourite parts (Diagon Alley) for a week until I could get to the library for CoS &  PoA. The scent of grass &  leaves &  warm air always stir those good memories. After that, I was thoroughly obsessed.  & #   The first 4 books were out at the time I got obsessed, and I read them over and over while I waited what seemed AGES for the release of OotP (actually it was probably only like a year). FINALLY it was released and I had pre-ordered it online since we didn't have a bookstore in my town. As it turns out, the one major grocery store ended up bringing in a skid of OotP so everyone else got their copies before me even though I had pre-ordered it :( man I was SO anxious for it to arrive in the mail. I kept asking my parents when they got home from work if it had arrived, and days went by without any delivery.   & #   One day I got a feeling that it must be arriving soon (this was before package tracking and we lived pretty far from a city). I made a plan to bring my rollerblades and a mini-backpack to school (this was the early 2000s after all), borrow our mailbox key, and skate to the post office on my lunch break. It had finally arrived!!! I was so excited to finally have it I nearly wiped out skating back down the ramp of the post office. Haha. I stopped at our local Subway to quickly eat a sandwich for lunch and started reading there.      Since this was very close to the end of the school year, we were just watching some movie in class that afternoon, so I asked my teacher for permission to read instead and sat near the window where I could use the light to read by.   & #   When HBP was released, I was away at camp for two weeks. I had either pre-ordered it or my mom picked it up while I was away. I made her promise to bring it with her when she picked me up from camp. She watched my final camp performance, packed my stuff up in the car, I said ""Hi Mum, love you. Gonna read now"" and probably didn't speak to her for 3 hours ;D  & #   So I was part of the magic for the release of 3 books and 7 of the 8 films. I think my mom may have feared for my mental stability at one point, since I couldn't talk about anything else! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm not really a fan of anything released post-Deathly Hallows. I like to keep the magic of the series just as it was when the books were still coming out. My memories of that time are just so pure and happy :) I wonder if that will ever happen again for me with the Potterverse? Maybe with a Marauders TV show or something, that would be cool.   & #   Ah, it's all just so nostalgic!!! &lt;3"

It still gets me. (I apologize if something similar has already been posted. This subreddit is huge and I suck at searching it.)  Watching Deathly Hallows Part 2 and reimagining the book in my head. Just so I have this straight --- When Harry opens the snitch right before entering the forest clearing, effectively destroying the 2nd to last horcrux (himself), he discovers the Resurrection Stone. So essentially, he is the ultimate master of death in this moment, correct? He had had the invisibility cloak since he was 11, had gained control of the elder wand earlier in Deathly Hallows, and now ""discovered"" the Resurrection Stone (even though he'd technically had it in his possession since early on in Deathly Hallows as well).  The part that gets me, is that he could have walked into the clearing without dropping the Resurrection Stone and been virtually indestructible; however, if he had done that, Voldemort could not have destroyed his own horcrux, which would have made them both ""invincible"", thus fulfilling the prophecy that ""neither could live while the other survives"" because Harry and Voldemort would have no quality of life whatsoever.  Not to mention the fact that Harry was a fucking horcrux the whole time and virtually indestructible to anyone BUT Voldemort, so every time we thought he was in peril there was absolutely NO chance of him actually dying in the first place.  This woman. She beautifully mind fucks me over and over again and the series is going to be 20 years old on June 26. Jesus."

2972,the goldmine café speculation my favorite headcannon for jacob and queenie s future upon returning from rio they open up an underground cafe for wizards in london let s simply for now call it the goldmine above it s still just a small bakery that also sells strange looking dough creatures but once in a while a customer pointendly asks jacob where he has learned all of this in  his response is paris it varies over the years of course this word grants the asking wizards entrance through a small door in the sidestreet next to the bakery and a wink from the little golden angel on it the stairs behind it lead to a cellar cafe where they are greeted by queenie and countless other wizards enjoying their lunch or coffee or tea of course and cake the goldmine not only becomes to place to grow up in for a few certain children but also a meeting spot for the leaque of extrodinariy ladies and gentlemen who can be seen on framed photos on the wall next to pictures from city and landcapes the us england france brazil and china etc and drawings of magical creatures i feel like this idea is even something that you could read out of the scene of jacob and queenie s first meeting they found that they both love to cook and bake and to make people happy through this jacob s words even when he talks to newt a little later and as aforementioned it would provide the group with a proper meeting spot for the fourth and fifth movie and the years between a little like the room of requirement for the da it would in any way be the perfect future for these two and a great way to try and settle a

This word grants the asking wizards entrance through a small door in the sidestreet next to the bakery, and a wink from the little golden angel on it.  The stairs behind it lead to a cellar cafe, where they are greeted by Queenie and countless other wizards enjoying their lunch or coffee (or tea of course) and cake.  The Goldmine not only becomes to place to grow up in for a few certain children, but also a meeting spot for the leaque of extrodinariy ladies and gentlemen who can be seen on framed photos on the wall, next to pictures from city- and landcapes the US, England, France, Brazil and China etc. … and drawings of magical creatures.  I feel like this idea is even something that you could read out of the scene of Jacob and Queenie’s first meeting - they found that they both love to cook and bake, and to make people happy through this (Jacob’s words even when he talks to Newt a little later) - and, as aforementioned, it would provide the group with a proper meeting spot for the fourth and fifth movie, and the years between - a little like the room of requirement for the DA.  It would, in any way, be the perfect future for these two, and a great way to try and settle a little after all the adventures they had to go through so far.  What do you think? Is this just an overly frosted (lol) daydream or could this really happen?  Thank you very much for reading :)"

I recently re-read the entire series after a few years. It was the first time I re-read the entire thing since high school. I think one of the most amazing things about the series is that you can take something new out of them each time you read them, depending on where you are at in life. I have grown a lot and read the books with a different perspective and that changed my view point on a lot of characters.   & #   For example, Sirius Black used to be my absolute favorite character growing up. I loved him and the relationship he built with Harry so, so much . After re-reading I felt that he was much more selfish, impulsive, and irrational than I had previously assessed --- He therefore fell in my power rankings.   & #   On the other hand, I really came to appreciate both Harry and Hermione more. Harry, I felt, was a much more nuanced, intelligent, and kind character than i had originally given him credit for being. Hermione, I truthfully used to be annoyed at, but she really kicks ass the entire series and is such a power house. She is often the voice of reason, and has a maturity beyond her years.   & #   How did your character power rankings change upon re-read and why?"

It goes without saying that JKR created something extraordinary, but I often find myself wishing for more rules in the wizarding world that limits magic.   For instance, I wish that you couldn’t see/hear unlimited things in the Pensieve when exploring memories. Harry being able to listen to the Marauder’s conversation when Snape hadn’t heard it himself seems a little unrealistic. I would prefer that you could only hear exactly what the memory holder had.   Also, I like the way the Pensieve shows all of the surroundings but I think those surroundings should be created only from memory since the memory holder couldn’t possibly know what was going on 360 degrees around him/her.   For example, if a bird was chirping behind the memory holder’s head, you would see a bird there but you wouldn’t know if that was how the bird actually looked because it was simply created by the memory holder’s idea of a bird."

During Grindelwald’s prediction for WWII, Jacob uttered “nuclear war...” I find this problematic.   First, the mushroom cloud synonymous with an atomic bomb was first seen in Halifax in 1917 but the word “nuclear” wasn’t common prior to 1944.   Second, prior to 1944, the use of nuclear fission was termed the Atomic Age or Atomic Era. The bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were called atomic bombs. This wouldn’t occur until 1945.   Third, nuclear fission was known prior to 1944 but the application of nuclear fission to the development of an atomic bomb wasn’t until 1930 when the work of Albert Einstein was applied and even then it wasn’t until 1938 that an atom was split by German scientists. It took seven years and loads of resources to develop the first atomic bomb in 1945.   This bothers me because Jacob shouldn’t have known what the mushroom cloud signified or even had words to explain what the bomb was.   I can brush past the numerous other plot holes but this was poor history. Oddly I find that more of an affront than the identity of Credence or Queenie’s decision.   Had they showed the mushroom cloud and the resulting devastation for emotional impact that would’ve been appropriate. They were devastating and ended WWII for that very reason. But to apply the wrong term and make it seem like it was common knowledge was poor story telling.   Loved the movie but this one flaw just disappointed me.   I won’t get into the whole “American Ministry of Magic” label... It’s the US. It would’ve been labeled “Department” but that’s neither here nor there."

I've been thinking a lot about Credence actually being Dumbledore's brother but I can't make it work in my mind. I'm of the mind that Percival perished in Azkaban well before Kendra died so I don't really see how he could have had another child, whether by Kendra or by another woman, around 1899-1901.  Although the Credence's-Obscurus-is-Ariana's theory sounded really silly to me at first, and still kinda does, I hope it turns out to be true. I really just want the Dumbledore family to remain as it is; there's no need for a bastard half brother.  Anyway, if Credence does turn out to be just a figurative brother or not a brother at all, which family do you all think he'll belong to? One we've already heard of? Will he somehow end up being revealed to be Corvus Lestrange despite what went down in CoG? Will he be a nobody? A random muggleborn?"

I think everything we learned in this movie is a downright lie I think Lita was either lying or didn't know the whole story or something strange happened there cuz that baby swap is weird . The Credence reveal I really don't believe that's true at all just based on Cannon and timelines. If you look at all the promo footage and all the trailers there is a lot of stuff that happened in those trailers that felt like misdirection for example the deluminator was used in trailers not seen in the film, the scene with Lita spinning and her fancy dress not in the movie, Credence releasing his obscurus on top of the building in Paris not in there. I'm also taking into consideration what JK Rowling said a few weeks ago about ""what you think you know might be wrong"" unless they are seriously messing with book Canon (I'm looking you McGonagall) I don't know it's just a theory but it's the one I'm living in."

Important to note he takes a very anti-muggle statement here and people with these beleves usually tend to be against muggle-magic relations.  And he says ""don't WE all die just a LITTLE""  WE for me means all wizards and LITTLE as in just a bit (but duh no shit)  I think he means that muggle make the Wizarding blood less pure and so the pure blood 'die a little' since it slowly decase with the mix of more and more Muggle-wizard relationships until evrryone will become, after some point, half bloods if not more muggleborn than half blood.  Grindelwald wanted wizards to be superior to muggles and for them to rule over the muggle world, I think that he'd also be against their cross relationship if one were to rule and be superior to the other.  (Bassicaly they would be slaves that can't be associated with the pure (and less pure) wizards)."

I don't think so at all Jenny Nicholson, a very popular YouTuber I like, says that Grindelwald has ""no discernible character"" in the movie, and I'm like did she even see the Pére Lachaise scene?! I, by no means, am saying that the movie is pitch perfect because the second act meanders a lot and has a lot of convoluted, contrived stories only existing to get our heroes to the finale in the cemetery and there are a couple of retcons I don't quite like but the opening scene and the final scene are pitch perfect. The critics call this movie ""a franchise killing disaster"", I'm like, overexaggerating much?! Some of the reviews I've read do their best to avoid any mention of Johnny Depp's amazing turn as Grindelwald, completely ignoring it.  While I agree that JK needs some help in making the story flow better because she's not a screenwriter but an author, the convoluted nature of the second act didn't bother me much, especially given how intense the opening and the climactic sequences were ending the story on a high.  What did you guys think?!"

745,not sure if i ve got any of this right but i would appreciate anyone who could clear it up for me from what i gathered voldemort couldn t kill  with his own wand because they both have the same core if i m right with that then how does  kill voldemort at the end of the deathly hallows even though all the horcruxes are destroyed i know voldemort was using the elder wand but i didn t think it actually belonged to him so surely his wand is still the same as  s the only explanation i could think of was that it only mattered if they were actually using the same core wands at the time or because  used expeliamus i think instead of avada kedavra,not sure if i ve got ani of thi right but i would appreci anyon who could clear it up for me from what i gather voldemort couldn t kill  with hi own wand becaus they both have the same core if i m right with that then how doe  kill voldemort at the end of the deathli hallow even though all the horcrux are destroy i know voldemort wa use the elder wand but i didn t think it actual belong to him so sure hi wand is still the same as  s the onli explan i could think of wa that it onli matter if they were actual use the same core wand at the time or becaus  use expeliamu i think instead of avada kedavra,not sure if i ve got ani of thi right but i would appreci anyon who could clear it up for me from what i gather voldemort couldn t kill  with hi own wand becaus they both have the same core if i m right with that then how doe  kill voldemort at the end of the deathli hallow even though all the horcrux are destroy i know voldemort wa use the elder wand but i didn t think it actual belong to him so sure hi wand is still the same as  s the onli explan i could think of wa that it onli matter if they were actual use the same core wand at the time or becaus  use expeliamu i think instead of avada kedavra,Not sure if I’ve got any of this right but I would appreciate anyone who could clear it up for me From what I gathered Voldemort couldn’t kill Harry with his own wand because they both have the same core. If I’m right with that then how does Harry kill Voldemort at the end of the deathly hallows (even though all the horcruxes are destroyed). I know Voldemort was using the elder wand but I didn’t think it actually belonged to him so surely his wand is still the same as Harry’s. The only explanation I could think of was that it only mattered if they were actually using the same core wands at the time.  Or because Harry used expeliamus (I think) instead of Avada Kedavra

I found a post pointing out that Harry tends to focus on the Expelliarmus spell, and it got me thinking.  Is it explained how that spell works?

Most of which have probably already been voiced but the one thing I haven't seen too many other people talking about is the representation of Dumbledore and Grindelwald.   Dumbledore is supposed to be a mysterious, whimsical, and eccentric person. I don't think Jude Law's portrayal of him was *bad,* just not accurate. I felt Dumbledore came off as just this cool and well-liked Professor who was pretty good at magic. We needed to see the REAL Dumbledore, the one that we got to know in the original Harry Potter series. He was too ordinary in this new movie.   Second, I have always imagined Grindelwald to be more like the Joker in the sense that he's pure evil and also a little crazy. All the glimpses we saw of him in the original Harry Potter books seemed to prove this (him jumping off the windowsill, his last moments before Voldemort kills him, and so on). In the movie, he was like freaking Jack Frost. Cold, closed off, and not at all cool, he didn't appear evil only manipulative and somewhat bad. Grindelwald is supposed to be powerful and dangerous and just this pure evil person consumed by his own desire for a Pureblood world. I was so incredibly disappointed with this portrayal of him. And while we're on that note, I couldn't see Depp as Grindelwald...I just kept seeing as Johnny Depp with lots of makeup on.   All in all, the movie had lots of issues but this bothered me the most. Thoughts? What did you think of how they were portrayed in the movie and how did you envision Grindelwald to be?"

What is he giving her? What is happening.....!&lt;  &gt;!Was he a prisoner at the circus or only Nagini? His old nanny ignored most of his questions and gave awners to questions he did not ask. The fight scene was longer in the trailers.!&lt;  &gt;!Scene on the roof was also cut. Does he control his powers or not? He didn't even make Grimsonn flinch....!&lt;  &gt;!Even in acompaning books he seems to have the short end of the stick. He is barely in any of them at all! And if he is it is still with FB1 harecut and clothes. I've seen more pics with him and Nagini eating some bread. Not in the movie.....!&lt;  &gt;!After FB1 J.K. Rowling said he would ' come back to life in a 'very painfull' way. And now it's just ' Oh yeah. he's immortal OK. He wasn't even hurt in FB 1"". There was supposed to be a scene where he would go back to the church and find his birth certificate there and FOR THAT REASON go to Parise. And now he just happend to chill out there untill someobe passing him a lot saying ' He man luckey you. You're find your awnser within walking distance. Aren;t you luckey!' .....!&lt;  &gt;!Hell does he even know Grindelwald was Mr. Graves??? Why was he suddenly all huggy with Grindelwald? The character of FB1 would at least have \*some\* reserve...!&lt;  &gt;!Even the actor was worried they cut him from FB Beast 2 because he was confused his ' ressurection' scene was cut and he was killed of instead.!&lt;  &gt;!For me, i really like Newts character. But yeah he is a good guy. Dumbeldore will defeat Grindelwald and Newt will marry Tina. I already know their end and the ' inbetween' is just amusing filler.!&lt;  &gt;!The character of Credence is the only really interesting! And it seems they changed their mind completely on his storyline! Appearently cutting him partly from FB1 but pretty much completely remove him from FB2. Just keeping in a few confusing key scenes and no character development (He is looking for him mommy) and what else? What about Ezra millers comment about Credence beeing a ticking timebomb and still having to fear for his life.!&lt;  &gt;!I am worried in FB3 he will be plot line fodder. Just killing him off or giving him little to no screentime. Like in favor of putting another character to the forefront. Dumbeldore killing him off or something so he has more to be gloomy about... It they would plan to do more with him they would have not cut so much character development.!&lt;  &gt;!What a shame to toss the most interesting character to the sideline like this,..!&lt;"

That just means it's going to continue to drop. WB will have to do something new and exciting next to make sure it makes more money next time.  They could conclude the Fantastic Beasts Series in movie 3. Then movie 4 and 5 can be completely different wizarding word stories. Or a spinoff with a sequel to Fantastic Beasts. Endless possibilities.  One day, Harry Potter will be like Marvel. There will be so many solo movies of wizarding world stories that will build and connect.  There is only one more movie in the series and then JK continues and concludes it in novel form.  It movies to WB streaming service.  It is cancelled completely.  Or it just continues to be 3 more films in Fantastic Beasts and the audience isn't paid attention to and it pisses people off so much that HP becomes hated like Star Wars. Only to come back with a reboot in 10 years.   It becomes a TV series and concludes in an epic theatre release.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Ruper Grint come back for movies about the next generation, like Star Wars Force Awakens. They are much older now. Harry Potter fans who were in their early teens would now be in their 40's and up. We all now have our Harry Potter movies back but they are nothing like the original 7. So different and weird and great. Our kids now experience a new Harry Potter and prefer it. Not even written by JK Rowling. Ultimate fan fiction of people who were fans as kids, now making new movies using their years of fan fiction and theorizing.   & #"

A big plot twist wich had my jaw drop to the floor and i kept saying o my god. After giving us the red herring of him being a lestrange,  which had many people theroy crafting for months he turned out not to be one. We went from Credence Barebone to Corvus Lestrange V to Aurelius Dumbledore. How that works out since mr.(brian?) Dumbledore died in azkaban when albus was quite young and kendra (mom) died when albus was in his late teens and movie jude law dumbledore is quite a bit older this puzzles me.  The thing about all the names and identities and infantcide surrounding credence reminds me of a character from the mortal instruments. It is a book series based on harry potter (main character is a girl name clary..) which has been arpund for 10 years. In the story there is another character who almost has a new ""true"" identity/name every book along with a lot of false ones, switching babies etc. This reminded me greatly of what they are doing with credence now."

Rowling left so many little details not many noticed... You know how each harry potter book gets bigger(well kinda)? I reread the books and noticed that the details are more through. Here is my inference: That as Harry Potter lived in the magic world, he became more used to it and noticed more details. Before, he was just taking it all in. But later in the books, he's more used to it and notices more...  and I'm pretty sure that J.K. Rowling has done a LOT more like this.  Tell me if I'm wrong, I'm still not 100% sure about this."

I'm not gonna deny how rude he was being to Harry and his friends, that was really bad. I however have sympathy for Severus since he grew up in an abusive household, stumbled upon Lily's corpse, and then was given the task to kill Dumbledore. He went through a lot of traumatic events.   I didn't care too much about Severus in the books, it was Alan Rickman's performance in the movies that just made me drawn to Severus (watched the movies before reading the books). Alan was able to convey a character that was neither entirely good or evil, he was a grey character with tremendous flaws and skills. Where his loyalty lies was the most important aspect once Dumbledore died and he chose his love for Lily over his loyalty to Voldemort.  From the beginning, he was portrayed as a villain, then a good guy, then it goes back and forth throughout the series, ultimately ending with him choosing the good side. [The Snape's memories scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHolRZeQNG4) in the deathly hallows part 2 was [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyf-kJWwIg). In Snape's memories, we see that he's upset that Harry is being raised like a pig for slaughter.  Watching Snape die and seeing those memories made his death the most saddest out of everyone's. :("

No more colored boxes or tissue paper and the items appear to be fewer and of lesser quality.

I’ve looked at Loot Crate but it looks like they only come bi-monthly?  *Geek Gear rant for anyone interested*  Most recently we had a problem where we requested in the notes of an order that the “You’re Accepted” box be addressed to my wife and not to me. The order arrived with my name on the letters and envelope and the last name was mis-spelled.

It seems like a lifetime ago now that i received my first copy of Harry potter. I just wondered what other people's experience was like. How did you find out about the series?  For me it was kind of a funny story. See growing up I had only one Aunt in my family. For some reason my brother and I came up with the most ridiculous name we could think of for a nickname, and i swear to god it was ""Aunt Petunia"".   This was well before the first book even came out. She was a librarian and bought us both a copy of the book sometime around when they were released, writing something inside about Aunt Petunia. She found it very funny.   I actually didnt read the book right away either. At some point i picked it up finally and was completely hooked."

If so, how? After starting to re-watch the movies, one thing I noticed is that Harry doesn’t seem to flinch at being called Harry Potter by Hagrid when he bursts into the cabin. Did the Dursleys tell him his last name? That would seem strange considering how desperately they want to keep him from his past and how much Petunia hated her sister and husband. You would think they would have given him the Dursley surname. This may be explained in the books, which I haven’t read in several years, so please be patient if this is obvious!"

(Random qoute from the foundation)  Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million years, yet only the last 4,000 have been of any significance. So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men, and rocks that came to life. So we called them 'gods' and 'demons,' and begged them to spare us and prayed for salvation.  In time, their numbers dwindled and our numbers rose. The world began to make more sense when there were less things to fear. Yet, the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.  Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, we must stand up for ourselves.  While the rest of mankind dwell in the light, we must stand in the darkness to combat it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane, normal world.  We secure. We contain. We protect."

Reading through Book 7 again.  Xenophilius says that anyone who can unite all three of the Deathly Hallows will become the Master of Death.  Obviously, there are two candidates, Harry and Dumbledore and perhaps Voldemort.   1. The Elder Wand.  Dumbledore had it ever since his duel with Grindlewald in the 1940's until Voldemort physically stole it from his grave in 1998.  We know that since Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore in book 6, he was its true master.  Here is a wrinkle. Although Harry never held the Elder Wand until after his duel with Voldemort, his physical disarming of Malfoy of his mother's wand in Malfoy Manor was supposed to have transferred ownership of both Malfoy's mom's wand AND the Elder wand to Harry.  2. The Resurrection Stone.  Voldemort turned it into a horcrux.  Dumbledore had it in 1996 and tried to wear it.  He destroyed at least the horcrux part of it.  Harry technically had it the whole time in book 7 but never was able to flip it to ""activate it"" until he was in the forest.    3. The Invisibility Cloak.  Very controversial.  Voldemort never had it.  Dumblemore borrowed it from James, but this was when Harry was a baby.  Harry was given the cloak his first year at Hogwarts, in 1991.  However, there has been discussion over this was truly the 3rd Hallow.  I wonder if Rowling wanted to take back that Madeye Moody could see through the cloak.  But she also had Bathilda Bagshot(Nagini) able to ""see"" through it.  Maybe Nagini could smell Harry or even Voldemort's soul in Harry.  The Hallow was supposed to be impenetrable, not even death could see through it.    Dumbledore did not have the ring until 1996(correct me if I am wrong).  By then, Harry had the cloak.  So Dumbledore never had all three at once.    Harry could have become the Master of Death.  Assuming that is the right cloak, he's had it pretty much through all 7 books.  Assuming he actually was the master of the Elder wand at Malfoy Manor, he had it for half of book 7.  Assuming Dumbledore did not break the stone, Harry was carrying it during all of book 7 and activated it in the forest before Voldemort ""killed"" him.    TL/DR:  Maybe Harry became master of death.  What do you all think?"

3889,the hunt for scamander theory previously i talked with a fellow tumblr user about why it seems that an entire squad of aurors is eager to get newt back to britain after his escape i think for the most part they came to hogwarts to ask for dumbledores help concerning grindelwald s escape remember he is known to be very intelligent and powerfull and until tom riddel asked for the post of the teacher for defense against the dark arts he had been offered the most of minister of magic three times not to mention that they refer to newt working under his orders how exactly did they know that but there are reason why they need to get newt back home so enjoy ___________________________________________  family bonds the one to put the most effort into this mission is likely his brother theseus the relationship between newt and his brother has always been described as tentiavely warm despite their differences through the letter theseus send him during the first movie and the scene by the end of the first tcog trailer we could see they are close as far as i can tell even though they may have some issues at the moment through theseus engagement i believe even before grindelwald s escape newt may have been targeted by his followers his brother is known as very powerfull a war hero joined the hunt for grindelwald and currently works in the department for magical law enforcement at the ministry he correspoded with percival graves during the incidents of new york and according to hp wiki he is head of the auror s deparment http  wikia com/wiki/auror_department i think people have faith in that he is more than capable of fighting grindelwald and his followers maybe american wizards used to believe in percival graves the same way conclusion it would make sense for grindelwald to capture his brother and blackmail/mentally abuse him with this to maybe lure theseus to a trap or simply to kill newt and let him live with the fact that he couldn t save him that s a truly evil villian he selects those who the commoner believes in and shows him that they can be defeated so far we only know about one other biological family member of theseus which is his mother either she is magically very well protected or newt has become the main target through grindelwald s capture or his followers do try to abduct her and we will still get to see that all in all he would be safer in britain with the ministry his brother and dumbledore close enough especially in london or at least within the country ___________________________________________  a necessairy evil jk rowling has stated that throughout the next movie we will learn why newt was allowed to keep his wand and work at the ministry my conclusion is that even before he published his book he was known for his talent with magical creatures and his astounding knowledge a confident programme by the ministry in wwi involving ukrainian ironbellys has been mentioned in his biography on hp wiki http  wikia com/wiki/newton_scamander we know that during the time of   wizards are sucessfully working with dragons in romania but it seems that during this time there weren t many people who they d respond to so we know he is special in his own way that dumbledore has faith in him he accordingly sees him as a kindred spirit and that his skills are widely known especially after he publishes his book we also get a small hint on his history of not always obeying the law during his short talk with the minister of foreign affairs during the first movie and what are you doing in new york i came to buy an appaloosa puffskin sir right what are you really doing here notice how the minister goes from relaxed to a little strict to friendlily not buying the lie almost like newt has lied straight to his face many times before but he knows there can t be anything too sinister behind it conclusion the ministry knows newt can and will break the law when it comes to magical  but they avoid too active restrainment of his actions since  noone wants to actively cross neither dumbledore nor theseus and  they know he is a valuable mind and that his work throughout his life will improve the life of magical creatures worldwide and the knowledge about them not to mention that they may hope for his help during the war against grindelwald also some may fear though unfounded that if they actively turned on him/fractured his sanity he may offer his skills to the dark side remember this man knows how to train dragons _________________________________________________ alright that s all for now

magic veri well protect or newt ha becom the main target through grindelwald s captur or hi follow do tri to abduct her and we will still get to see that all in all he would be safer in britain with

as a kindr spirit and that hi skill are wide known especi after he publish hi book we also get a small hint on hi histori of not alway obey the law dure hi short talk with the minist of foreign affair dure the first movi and what are you do in new york i came to buy an appaloosa puffskin sir right what are you realli do here notic how the minist goe from relax to a littl strict to friendlili not buy the lie almost like newt ha lie straight to hi face mani time befor but he know there can t be anyth too sinist behind it conclus the ministri know newt can and will break the law when it come to magic  but they avoid too activ restrain of hi action sinc  noon want to activ cross neither dumbledor nor theseu and  they know he is a valuabl mind and that hi work throughout hi life will improv the life of magic creatur worldwid and the knowledg about them not to mention that they may hope for hi help dure the war against grindelwald also some may fear though unfound that if they activ turn on him/fractur hi saniti he may offer hi skill to the dark side rememb thi man know how to train dragon _________________________________________________ alright that s all for now anyth to add pleas let me know thank you veri much for read,"The hunt for Scamander (?) (Theory) Previously, I talked with a fellow Tumblr user about why it seems that an entire squad of aurors is eager to get Newt back to Britain after his escape…  I think for the most part, they came to Hogwarts to ask for Dumbledores help concerning Grindelwald’s escape (remember, he is known to be very intelligent and powerfull, and until Tom Riddel asked for the post of the teacher for defense against the dark arts, he had been offered the most of minister of magic three times - not to mention that they refer to Newt working under “his orders” (how exactly did they know that?).  But there are reason why they need to get Newt back home … so enjoy :)  ___________________________________________   **1. Family bonds**  The one to put the most effort into this mission is likely his brother Theseus. The relationship between Newt and his brother has always been described as “tentiavely warm” despite their differences… through the letter Theseus send him during the first movie and the scene by the end of the first TCOG trailer, we could see they are close, as far as I can tell … even though they may have some issues at the moment through Theseus’ engagement.  I believe even before Grindelwald’s escape, Newt may have been targeted by his followers … his brother is known as “very powerfull”, a “war hero”, joined the hunt for Grindelwald and currently works in the department for magical law enforcement at the ministry. He correspoded with Percival Graves during the incidents of New York, and according to HP wiki, he is head of the auror’s deparment.  (http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror_Department )  I think people have faith in that he is more than capable of fighting Grindelwald and his followers… maybe american wizards used to believe in Percival Graves the same way …  Conclusion: it would make sense for Grindelwald to capture his brother and blackmail/mentally abuse him with this, to maybe lure Theseus to a trap - or simply to kill Newt and let him live with the fact that he couldn’t save him.  That’s a truly evil villian … he selects those who the commoner believes in and shows him that they can be defeated.  So far, we only know about one other biological family member of Theseus, which is his mother… either she is magically very well-protected or Newt has become the main target through Grindelwald’s capture… or his followers do try to abduct her and we will still get to see that :)  All in all, he would be safer in Britain with the ministry, his brother and Dumbledore close enough, especially in London… or at least within the country.  ___________________________________________   **2. A necessairy evil**  JK Rowling has stated that throughout the next movie we will learn why Newt was allowed to keep his wand and work at the ministry … my conclusion is that even before he published his book, he was known for his talent with magical creatures and his astounding knowledge… a confident programme by the ministry in WWI involving Ukrainian Ironbellys has been mentioned in his biography on HP wiki… http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Newton_Scamander  We know that during the time of Harry Potter, wizards are sucessfully working with dragons in Romania… but it seems that during this time, there weren’t many people who they’d respond to.  So, we know he is special in his own way, that Dumbledore has faith in him (he accordingly sees him as a kindred spirit), and that his skills are widely known, especially after he publishes his book … we also get a small hint on his history of not always obeying the law during his short talk with the minister (of foreign affairs) during the first movie.  *“… and what are you doing in New York?”  “I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskin, sir.”  “Right. What are you really doing here?”*  Notice how the minister goes from relaxed to a little strict to friendlily not buying the lie… almost like Newt has lied straight to his face many times before, but he knows there can’t be anything too sinister behind it.  Conclusion: the ministry knows Newt can and will break the law when it comes to magical beasts, but they avoid too active restrainment of his actions since 1. noone wants to actively cross neither Dumbledore nor Theseus and 2. they know he is a valuable mind and that his work throughout his life will improve the life of magical creatures worldwide and the knowledge about them.   Not to mention that they may hope for his help during the war against Grindelwald.  Also, some may fear (though unfounded) that if they actively turned on him/fractured his sanity, he may offer his skills to the dark side (remember, this man knows how to train dragons).   _________________________________________________   Alright, that’s all for now :) Anything to add?

(For example, a O in Potion would be an A+ in Chemistry....""Captain of Quidditch Team"" would become ""Captain of soccer team"" something along those lines).  & #   It would also help the kids during holidays breaks to talk about school and their life, without breaking the secrecy.  & #   And when they're adult, they're also are given what is the muggle equivalent of their job, and some of their activities.  & #   Also, I decided that there's a whole shelves of parenting books at Flourish and Botts for parents of Muggle-Borns to help them out.

2922,the idea of a child theleta theory spoiler hi there a small theory about leta and later on theseus relationship to their past and how it might effect theirs not in a negative way enjoy _______________________________________________________________________________________ a little voice inside her head throughout the second movie leta is haunted by a sort of vision of her little brother drowing i believe it s not just the chance of someone who potentially could have bonded with her in some way despite corvus influence but also great fear of having an own child i do believe she wanted a future with theseus and children but was terrified of how she could never forget what had happened to her brother and how responsible she felt i think theseus didn t know about her past but maybe can relate to how she feels since very likely he carries guilt as well _________________________________________________________________________ man myth reject so far we know that he saved the lives of muggles during wwi but during war one can never save every life and i m pretty sure he has rather painfull feelings about being called a war hero technically he cannot be blamed either since he only tried to help but just like her he may not be able to live with how he influenced who lived and died although it may likely have happened anyway considering this the pasts and feelings they are battling with actually come very close leta was just a child that wanted to sleep and theseus a young man who wanted to protect people and they both struggle also in almost  years of working as an auror theseus had to kill people in some situations and i think it s even more clear how he feels about this when he mentions to newt how he doesn t like to have a bounty hunter involved in the hunts mission either he seems to feel at this point that sometimes there s no other way to ensure the life and well being of the majority but it doesn t feel right to him it s actually something tina may be able to relate to as well in her case we can only talk about   years of active law enforcement and no involvement in wwi but there must have been some cases of self defense etc in her history as well while newt struggles with the unintentional death of the sudanese girl he only tried to help there are very well placed parallels between the two couple s traumata it s very interesting i really wonder if this is going to be brought up at some point makes for a nice message of how it s important and often very helpfull to talk about what weighs on you with people who know what it feels like getting back to topic i believe theseus would have liked tp have children as well but on his part couldn t live with the chance of them loving/looking up to him and not knowing about what he thinks he has done _______________________________________________________ shared pain i d actually really like to see if leta should turn out to be alive a storyline in which they reveal their respective burdens to each other maybe even in relation to leta having given birth to a child by the third movie and realize on a deeper basis why they belong together they see what the other considers his dark side his unforgivable past and accept it continuing their relationship with all masks off what do you think anything to add thank you very much for reading,the idea of a child

continu their relationship with all mask off what do you think anyth to add thank you veri much for read,"The idea of a child (Theleta theory (spoiler)) Hi there :)  A small theory about Leta and later on Theseus relationship to their past … and how it might effect theirs not in a negative way…   Enjoy :)   _______________________________________________________________________________________    **A little voice inside her head**  Throughout the second movie, Leta is haunted by a sort of vision of her little brother drowing … I believe it’s not just the chance of someone who potentially could have bonded with her in some way (despite Corvus’ influence) … but also great fear of having an own child.  I do believe she wanted a future with Theseus, and children… but was terrified of how she could never forget what had happened to her brother, and how responsible she felt.  I think Theseus didn’t know about her past … but maybe can relate to how she feels … since very likely, he carries guilt as well.   _________________________________________________________________________   **Man, myth... reject**  So far, we know that he saved the lives of muggles during WWI … but during war, one can never save every life  … and I’m pretty sure he has rather painfull feelings about being called a war “hero”.  Technically, he cannot be blamed either, since he only tried to help … but just like her, he may not be able to live with how he influenced who lived and died, although it may likely have happened anyway.  Considering this, the pasts and feelings they are battling with actually come very close - Leta was just a child that wanted to sleep, and Theseus a young man who wanted to protect people … and they both struggle.  Also, in almost 20 years of working as an auror, Theseus had to kill people in some situations … and I think it’s even more clear how he feels about this when he mentions to Newt how he doesn’t like to have a bounty hunter involved in the hunts mission either. He seems to feel, at this point, that sometimes there’s no other way to ensure the life and well-being of the majority, but it doesn’t feel right to him.  It’s actually something Tina may be able to relate to as well … in her case, we can only talk about 5-7 years of active law enforcement and no involvement in WWI, but there must have been some cases of self-defense etc. in her history as well … while Newt struggles with the unintentional death of the Sudanese girl he only tried to help … there are very well-placed parallels between the two couple’s traumata, it’s very interesting :) I really wonder if this is going to be brought up at some point … makes for a nice message of how it’s important and often very helpfull to talk about what weighs on you with people who know what it feels like.   Getting back to topic, I believe Theseus would have liked tp have children as well, but on his part couldn’t live with the chance of them loving/looking up to him and not knowing about what he thinks he has done.   _______________________________________________________    **Shared pain **  I’d actually really like to see (if Leta should turn out to be alive) a storyline in which they reveal their respective burdens to each other - maybe even in relation to Leta having given birth to a child by the third movie - and realize on a deeper basis why they belong together. They see what the other considers his dark side, his unforgivable past - and accept it. Continuing their relationship with all masks off.  What do you think? Anything to add?  Thank you very much for reading :)"

Given we’re talking about a repressed boy with a religious upbringing that goes to dark, secluded alleyways to meet with a handsome man who gently caresses him, it’s clear Graves is acting like a sexual predator. This behavior somewhat continues in the next movie, notably during the Fiendfyre scene where they leave together.  In CoG, we learn that Credence, *according to Grindelwald*, is actually Aurealis Dumbledore. Given what we know about Dumbledore (Albus) and Grindelwald’s relationship, if it’s true that Grindelwald was also in love with Albus, it’s possible that *he’s grooming Credence as a replacement for Albus.*  Think on that for a bit."

He forgot to press the knot that immobilize the tree  and took a HUGE branch to the groin. Because of this, Harry was actually conceived by Lily and a house elf named Foggy.  Foggy was the Potter's house-elf and was given to James and Lily as a wedding gift. Anyways, house-elves can make their own version of polyjuice potion, and that's exactly what James and Lily had him do. Lily vigorously rode Foggy transformed as James (although she wouldn't kiss him on the mouth), until his seed was spilled and planted deep. That's why Harry has green eyes (Lily), untidy jet black hair (James), and of course his knobbly knees (Foggy).  Naturally, James and Lily wanted this kept secret so the last command given to Foggy was to disapparate to the Black Lake and to feed himself to the giant squid. After that day, Foggy was never mentioned again. Even their closest friends and family never knew, and when his disappearance was brought up, James and Lily would lie and say they set Foggy free.  & #   I asked JK Rowling and she confirmed this to be true."

Never understood Dumbledore’s reasoning for not telling Harry that Voldemort would try to send him fake visions to lure him into the Department of Mysteries which is why he had Snape teach Harry how to block his mind. I mean he knows that Harry hates Snape and vice versa thus he’ll have a hard time keeping himself cool (an essential in Occlumency). If Dumbledore wants Harry to apply himself in Occlumency, then he best way to do so is to give Harry a motive for learning, in this case making sure Voldemort doesn’t take advantage of their connection to invade Harry’s mind. Tell Harry that as long as the connection exists, Voldemort could use it to spy on Dumbledore and the Order which is why Dumbledore has been avoiding him all year or worse, Voldy May try to possess him as he was possessing Nagini at the time. Given how paranoid Harry was abt the possibility of Voldemort possessing him after witnessing the attack on Mr Weasley, no doubt Harry would’ve jumped on the chance of learning how to keep Voldemort from invading his mind if he knew that was the point of his Occlumency lessons. The Order members for some reason or other seem to be board with not telling Harry why he needs to learn Occlumency even though they know he’s stuck with Snape whom he despises and likely to be miserable. When Harry told Sirius and Lupin that Snape had stopped teaching him, at that point either one of them should’ve said “Voldemort is trying to lure you to the Department of Mysteries via fake visions to get you killed. That’s why we had you learning Occlumency!”"

1544,what's up with all this there should be a   tv series discussions every single week in this sub a redditor posts something like that in this sub and begins his discussion with something like the movies were good but not great due to the amount of info that needs to be omitted for the sake of runtime this problem won't be present in a tv series look i know that many fans are not happy with the way the movies had to omit things in the books and i agree that the movies would have been far more better if it was a tv series instead but please for god's sake stop posting this almost once a week in this sub sure it is interesting the first time you post it but it gets annoying as time progresses why there's such a demand for a tv series in this sub or probably the whole fandom is it because of jealousy that lord of the rings is being rebooted in amazon as a tv series and his dark materials is receiving a tv show in hbo is it because of jealousy that game of thrones was able to have all the info in the books thanks to being a series instead of movies is it because the fans want to see the info that was omitted in the movies on the screen is it because the fans want to restart the series because they are unable to let go or because some fans just cannot accept that movies need to omit things for the sake of runtime and wants to have the damage repaired by rebooting the series in the form of a tv show i may get downvoted to the center of the earth for saying this but do you want to know my opinion well my opinion is this i don't want a tv show that's right i don't want a tv

Every single week in this sub, a redditor posts something like that in this sub and begins his discussion with something like "" the movies were good, but not great, due to the amount of info that needs to be omitted for the sake of runtime, this problem won't be present in a TV series "" .  Look, I know that many fans are not happy with the way the movies had to omit things in the books and I agree that the movies would have been far more better if it was a TV series instead, but please, for God's sake, stop posting this almost once a week in this sub, sure it is interesting the first time you post it but it gets annoying as time progresses .  Why there's such a demand for a TV series in this sub or probably the whole fandom ?! Is it because of jealousy that Lord Of The Rings is being rebooted in Amazon as a TV series and His Dark Materials is receiving a TV Show in HBO ?! Is it because of jealousy that Game Of Thrones was able to have all the info in the books thanks to being a series instead of movies ?! Is it because the fans want to see the info that was omitted in the movies on the screen ?! Is it because the fans want to restart the series because they are unable to let go ?! Or because some fans just cannot accept that movies need to omit things for the sake of runtime and wants to have the "" damage repaired "" by rebooting the series in the form of a TV show ?!  I may get downvoted to the center of the Earth for saying this, but, do you want to know my opinion ?! Well my opinion is this : "" I DON'T WANT A TV SHOW ""  That's right, I don't want a TV show, sorry not sorry, my reasons are this :  1. I'm too used to the old actors in the movies ( the least important reason )  2. I don't want the same story to be told for the third time, I've had enough, I was told the story for the first time in the form of the movies, then I read the books and heard the same story for the second time in a much more detailed way . I already know everything about the story of Harry James Potter, there's no need to tell me the same story that was in the books and movies in just a different medium . ( my most important reason )  3. Those who are pissed that the movies had to omit things, go read the books, they have every detail you want and nothing is omitted .  4. If a TV show that focuses on another era of the Wizarding World ever went into production, I would gladly watch it . A TV show about the First Wizarding War ?! Hell yeah !! I will gladly watch it !! A TV show about the Hogwarts founders ?! Of course !! Hell, create a TV show about a certain wizard kid ( make the kid a boy or a girl, I don't care ) who lives in another part of the world ( in America, Australia, Asia, France, idk, everywhere ) and is special in his/her own way and has nothing to do with Harry, Voldemort, Death Eaters, etc, I will gladly watch it . But, a TV show which is just a retelling of the books ?! No, just no, I already know everything about Harry's story and doesn't want to repeat the same thing again .   You're free to agree or disagree with me ."

The math works out to:  * Diary:    1/2 50% * Ring:     1/4 25% * Locket:  1/8 12.5% * Cup:      1/16 6.3% * Diadem: 1/32 3.1% * Harry:    1/64 1.6% * Nagini:   1/128 0.8%  I think that amount of soul contained pretty well matches the power of each horcrux. Tom's diary is the strongest in the books, and the ring was powerful enough to curse Dumbledore to eventual death.  The locket made Ron leave his girlfriend and best friend. We don't spend a lot of time with the Cup and Diadem but no powers are specifically mentioned.  As for Harry and Nagini they seem to have more of a direct connection to Voldy, but they are also living beings so they might have a special relationship that the inanimate objects don't. Currently I'm on DH in a re-read so I have been thinking a lot about horcruxes. Thoughts?"

Why did he attempt to kill Molly? He didn't even have that intense of a reaction when Nagini died and it was definitely not because he was afraid to lose the war. Lord Voldemort would never rely on a single Death Eater who didn't even master her wand especially when he thought that he was the master of the Elder Wand. What was the point of this? It was not significant to the plot in any way. Why did JK Rowling have him do it? What did she think? I think it was just stupid and waste of lines. My cheerful mood due to her death was ruined by the stupid scream. Did she try to humanise him or something? If that was the case, then it was an extremely stupid thing to even try. Bellatrix's death is the only part in the Battle of Hogwarts that I prefer in the movies because there was no ridiculous scream. I cringed at the scream. Why did she have to do it? I just need to know why it was worth mentioning in the books. And Snape was clearly his favourite at that time, not Bellatrix. It makes no sense that he didn't even regret Snape's death but went all bonkers on the death of a woman who had lost him a piece of his soul less than a day ago. I am not saying that he would regret Snape's death. What I am saying is that Lord Voldemort would never react like that to the death of a mere servant. I can't accept the scream as canon, no matter what."

Snape’s memory was straight up magical. I got goosebumps when I saw this masterpiece for the first time. That scene was so well executed and just plain beautiful. The emotions were depicted so well in that scene that I even felt them myself. I was just so moved by the entire memory and I still haven’t gotten over how perfect it was. Prior to watching it, I always thought Snape was a bad guy. I didn’t like how he treated Harry and I grew to hate him when he killed Dumbledore. He was always viewed as a villain throughout the films. It’s crazy how we learned more in that 5 minute scene than we did in the entire series. All the lies, misconceptions, and judgements of Snape ended with the revelation of the truth. Snape hated James but loved Lilly. This explains Snape’s love/hate relationship with Harry. He was always tough on Harry but also secretly looked out for him. Severus Snape is indeed the bravest man you’ve ever known Harry."

This might not be anything but random coincidence, but if we compare the scene of Quirrell and Harry at the mirror:  & #   &gt;Harry screwed up his courage.   &gt;   &gt;‘I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,’ he invented. ‘I – I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.’   &gt;   &gt;Quirrell cursed again.   &gt;   &gt;‘Get out of the way,’ he said. As Harry moved aside he felt the Philosopher’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?   &gt;   &gt;But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips   &gt;   &gt;‘He lies … He lies …’   &gt;   &gt;‘Potter, come back here!’ Quirrell shouted. ‘**Tell me the truth**! What did you just see?’   &gt;   &gt;The high voice spoke again.   &gt;   &gt;‘Let me speak to him … face to face …'   &gt;   &gt;‘Master, you are not strong enough!’   &gt;   &gt;‘I have strength enough … for this …’  & #   to when Dumbledore met Tom Riddle:  & #   &gt;He was pointing at the door through which Mrs Cole had just left.   &gt;   &gt;‘No, no,’ said Dumbledore, smiling.   &gt;   &gt;‘I don’t believe you,’ said Riddle. ‘She wants me looked at, doesn’t she? **Tell the truth**!’   &gt;   &gt;He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.  & #   Notice the parts I've highlighted in bold? I wonder if Voldemort was so desperate, at that point by the Mirror, that his influence over Quirrell resulted in this outburst. Lol, Riddle was so close to getting his body back in book 1 but he was so far as well."

And that thing Newt was riding was her in kelpie form and that scene is a flashback. When he was in Hogwarts and I believe he was expelled to keep her secret. I believe the curse was either done by Letas father's family the lestranges or his first wife. Because I really believe back in their era their was also racial tensions as well and her mother and father's marriage was frowned upon. I also believe the new companion screenplay feature kelipes and not dragons scrolled in gold on the cover. Any ideas?????

We hear about Harry putting the Marauders’ map into his pocket with a bag of Zonko’s/ Honey Dukes in POA. He managed to fit Riddles diary in to his pocket, which seem like it would be a bit harder than the map, but still plausible. What really got me thinking about this is that Harry was able to get the invisibility cloak into one of his pockets when he was in the cave with Dumbledore in DH.  The only two explosions I have for this are that the size of these items are bigger in my mind than what they are, or Harry’s pockets are massive."

In Prisoner of Azkaban Harry and Ron are in divination and Professor Trelawny asks Ron to read Harry's tea leaves. He says, ""you're going to suffer, but you're going to be happy about it."" If you think about it Harry did suffer: he learned that Sirius was his Godfather and that he betrayed his parents.  Then, he goes through the whole mess of chasing Sirius into the Shrieking Shake and everything that happened there, almost dying from the dementors before being saved by himself. But in the end, he was happy."
3590,cog another reason why we shouldn't believe that thing spoiler we have all heard about the timeline not lining up with the birth of credence and him being the brother of albus and aberforth and many other reasons why basically everything grindelwald says at the end of the movie is a lie however i would like to focus on a fact that should make even angry and slightly mad credence suspicious about grindelwald what many people seem to forget are the information we can get from the first   movie especially before the big credence is the obscurial reveal grindelwald or graves at that point uses credence to look for the obscurial and it doesn't even cross his mind it could be him simply because he is too old this is first dead giveaway that points to the fact that even grindelwald probably doesn't know anything about credence or knows the truth but doesn't want to say it another problem appears straight away during the same scene grindelwald tells credence he has no idea whether he is looking for a boy or a girl and then suddenly a few months later knows even credences real name of course he can say he has learnt the truth just recently but i guess even credence would be suspicious about it and lastly there is this little hint hidden in the name dropped at the end of the movie we all know j k loves her foreshadowing and hiding meanings everywhere she can it can be a bit far stretched but stay with me for a while aurelius dumbledore who else shares that name almost everyone has ever heard about marcus aurelius and that's pretty much it i'm not a big history geek but i just remembered this little thing about marcus aurelius he was one of the adopted emperors if i'm not mistaken that means he was chosen beforehand to succeed as a ruler he wan't bound by blood to the previous emperor so in my mind his name is basically adopted dumbledore d i believe there is nothing connecting him to the dumbledore brothers except perhaps the obsucur inside of him i could of course continue about how ariana's obscurus could have been attached to credence somehow so he would be in a way a brother to albus and aberforth because part of ariana's soul would be a part of him etc but that has been said many times already in the past days what dou you think,cog anoth reason whi we shouldn't believ that thing spoiler we have all heard about the timelin not line up with the birth of credenc and him be the brother of albu and aberforth and mani other reason whi basic everyth grindelwald say at the end of the movi is a lie howev i would like to focu on a fact that should make even angri and slightli mad credenc suspici about grindelwald what mani peopl seem to forget are the inform we can get from the first   movi especi befor the big credenc is the obscuri reveal grindelwald or grave at that point use credenc to look for the obscuri and it doesn't even cross hi mind it could be him simpli becaus he is too old thi is first dead giveaway that point to the

thing about marcu aureliu he wa one of the adopt emperor if i'm not mistaken that mean he wa chosen beforehand to succeed as a ruler he wan't bound by blood to the previou emperor so in my mind hi name is basic adopt dumbledor d i believ there is noth connect him to the dumbledor brother except perhap the obsucur insid of him i could of cours continu about how ariana' obscuru could have been

read it the most it's got the most fun for me the quidditch world cup and all the triwizard challenges as well as the flood of additional wizards and witches from the two other schools it's got a very different format than all the other books outside of the  i would say however i've finally got it through my thick skull that cedric's death is truly a turning point in the entire series as albus says soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy and in the movie not the book hermione says everything's going to change now isn't it i finally realized the full impact of those words they indeed are referring to a deep turning point in the story books   and  get increasingly darker in terms of revelations story and characters lost i suppose its like a reality check for the reader like hey this isn't your snow white and the seven dwarves anymore i realized this is perhaps a major reason why book  stands out so much for me it's the last book that is really about the more fun and magic parts of the   world before seriously diving in to the voldemort / horcrux / wizard war plot line not saying the following books dont have fun parts or that the story is any less excellent just the nature of the story itself is a bit darker well i guess i don't really know what i'm trying to say truthfully if you haven't noticed at this point i'm a bit buzzed right now my girlfriend is out of town and i'm home alone drinking some brews but i'll say it i'm  of course not the oldest   fan by any means but somewhere in my heart these books just make me feel like i'm back

89,greyback and bill so i'm doing a reread aren't we all and i come across the end of ootp where draco has let the death eaters into hogwarts bill is laying in a hospital bed with his face torn up and everybody is worried that since he was bitten by greyback he might become a werewolf himself now the interesting part is that they are all talking about werewolf bites specifically and it is brought up that since greyback hadn't actually transformed bill might be in the clear the only explanation that i can see here is that bill was having portions of his face bitten off by a fully human wizard not a wolf like another man had him pinned down and was chewing on his face which in turn must mean that when greyback was picking his teeth when dumbledore was cornered on the tower he was loosening bits of weasley flesh from between them may i say wtf,greyback and bill so i'm do a reread aren't we all and i come across the end of ootp where draco ha let the death eater into hogwart bill is lay in a hospit bed with hi face torn up and everybodi is worri that sinc he wa bitten by greyback he might becom a werewolf himself now the interest part is that they are all talk about werewolf bite specif and it is brought up that sinc greyback hadn't actual transform bill might be in the clear the onli explan that i can see here is that bill wa have portion of hi face bitten off by a fulli human wizard not a wolf like anoth man had him pin down and wa chew on hi face which in turn must mean that when greyback wa pick hi teeth when dumbledor wa corner on the tower he wa loosen bit of weasley flesh from between them may i say wtf,greyback and bill so i'm do a reread aren't we all and i come across the end of ootp where draco ha let the death eater into hogwart bill is lay in a hospit bed with hi face torn up and everybodi is worri that sinc he wa bitten by greyback he might becom a werewolf himself now the interest part is that they are all talk about werewolf bite specif and it is brought up that sinc greyback hadn't actual transform bill might be in the clear the onli explan that i can see here is that bill wa have portion of hi face bitten off by a fulli human wizard not a wolf like anoth man had him pin down and wa chew on hi face which in turn must mean that when greyback wa pick hi teeth when dumbledor wa corner on the tower he wa loosen bit of weasley flesh from between them may i say wtf,"Greyback and Bill So, I'm doing a reread (aren't we all?), and I come across the end of OotP, where Draco has let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Bill is laying in a hospital bed with his face torn up, and everybody is worried that, since he was bitten by Greyback, he might become a werewolf himself.  Now, the interesting part is that they are all talking about werewolf BITES specifically. And it is brought up that since Greyback hadn't actually transformed, Bill might be in the clear.  The only explanation that I can see here is that Bill was having portions of his face bitten off by a fully human wizard, not a wolf. Like, another man had him pinned down and was chewing on his face.  Which in turn must mean that when Greyback was picking his teeth when Dumbledore was cornered on the tower, he was loosening bits of Weasley flesh from between them.  May I say - wtf?"

They never explained his survival. 3) This question is about nobody from muggle world being able to see when Grindelwald was transported from Macusa. I mean, they went below bridge and alighted on the river at some point. Then they went upwards and that was somewhere in the middle of the city.

I’ve been struggling a lot lately with tattoos that I want to get, because currently all of the tattoos I have are a memorial of sorts, and my body is beginning to feel like a graveyard. I’ve always wanted a Harry Potter tattoo, because for many years i’ve been in love with the books. I know many people get the deathly hallows, but I just don’t connect with that story as much. I fell in love with Snape’s character. I love the idea that every day, we can choose a path different from the one we were on yesterday. I love that even though Snape was a death eater, Dumbledore trusted him entirely. That he came from a bad background and ended a hero. I had a rough childhood and think it would be a good reminder that my past does not define me, and that I can grow from it every day. I’m struggling with this, because it seems to be a popular opinion that the dark mark is a symbolism of “nazis” or “supremacists.” I am happy to explain its meaning to those who ask, but am scared it will scare away people. Thoughts?"

3911,skender theory in a scene cut out from the end of the first fb movie the ringmaster of circus arcanus already had an appearence he met with credence after he recovered from the attack by the

appearently made a friend in maledictus yet it kinda points out to me that on the moving picture in the trailer he is the only one not moving what happened to him i believe he has him training him along with the other artists his job being lifting them up into the air in obscurus form invisible and smashing through solid materials as part of the show to keep his powers under control skender either arranged a wand for him to practise to lower his magic to a safe level yet strong enough for his performance has him training his performance on a regular basis once he is exhausted and tired he lets him rest until his power is high enough again to go into obscurus form which means he constantly goes back and forth between exhaustion and his magic rising to an uncomfortable level has him training regularily but never to exhaustion this way credence learns to go back and forth in his forms without bursting out and using his power safely since credence is an important part of the show skender treats him friendlily gaining his trust the second option is the more dramatic one where credence would want to escape the circus and dream of a better life but can t since he s got nowhere to go still fears the macusa and most of all can t leave the slowly transforming maledictus behind yet the third one is more likely a story where credence is betrayed once more by someone he thought was going to help him would make sense yet does skender as i mentioned credence on the picture is not moving at all along with his stern expression this could mean that has learned to control his obscurus

He met with Credence after he recovered from the attack by the MACUSA and offered him a job at Circus Arcanus. When he hesitated, Skender pointed out that his life was at stake in America, which led him to agree and join the circus headed to europe (on the same boat as Newt).  Skender is said to be a rather **ambigious** character… yet what does that mean for the next movie?  ____________________________________  **Credence' new life**  So far, Credence seems healthy and has appearently made a friend in Maledictus … yet it kinda points out to me that on the moving picture in the trailer, **he is the only one not moving.**  What happened to him?  I believe he has him training him along with the other artists, his job being **lifting them up into the air** in Obscurus form (invisible) and **smashing through solid materials** as part of the show.  To keep his powers under control, Skender either   * arranged a wand for him to practise, to lower his magic to a safe level, yet strong enough for his performance  * has him training his performance on a regular basis - once he is exhausted and tired, he lets him rest until his power is high enough again to go into Obscurus form - which means he constantly goes back and forth between exhaustion and his magic rising to an uncomfortable level…  * has him training regularily, but never to exhaustion - this way Credence learns to go back and forth in his forms without bursting out and using his power safely. Since Credence is an important part of the show, SKender treats him friendlily, gaining his trust    The second option is the more dramatic, one where Credence would want to escape the circus and dream of a better life… but can’t since he’s got nowhere to go, still fears the MACUSA and most of all, can’t leave the slowly transforming Maledictus behind.  Yet the third one is more likely… a story where Credence is betrayed once more by someone he thought was going to help him would make sense… yet does Skender?  As I mentioned, Credence on the picture is not moving at all… along with his stern expression, this could mean that has learned to control his Obscurus and can use it at will now safely.  I think you alrealdy sense a bigger plan behind this…  ______________________________________________________   **A deal with Grindelwald**  It is possible that Skender is a follower of Grindelwald, who (since this man has his ways) **got the order to train Credence …** It would make sense… especially if Grindelwald hears that he is taking care of the boy. And after his breakout … he may visit the Circus to examine the result of Skender’s training.  And to recruit Credence.  Yet… will Skender give him up just like that?

Hey  guys, I've been thinking about the end of the movie, where it is said  that Credence is Albus brother, but for me it makes no sense.  So I  tought, is it possible that Credence is actualy Albus nephew? I mean, I  know Ariana was only 14 at the time of her death, but we see plenty of  girls getting pregnant at this age so it is possible, and there is the 3  muggles that beat her up (that's why albus father was sent to Azkaban).  So maybe Creedence, or Aurelius, is the product of a rape and that is  why he was given away.  A baby conceived  of rape was concidered a shameful thing to a family and we know that  wizards are very conservative in the 1980's, so imagine it in the 19th  century.

But Hogwarts and the wizarding world in general seem to make rape quite ""accessable"". In the second movie Hermione hands Ron and Harry cupcakes with a 'very strong sleep-potion' to make Crabbe and Goyle sleep while they interrogate Malfoy using the polyjuice. This should not be legal for obvious reasons. They could have done literally anything they wanted with the two. Same goes for love-potions as explained in another recent thread. Are there more, somewhat rapey, spells and potions in the Harry Potter universe or is it managed at some point in the books that this magic is prohibited or maybe even impossible to use."

So I guess pretty much every death eater can see the black skeleton horses, but can Voldemort?  The general agrement is that to see Thestrals you most see death and then “Come to terms with” or “accept” it. But Voldemort above all else fears death, that is why he creates the Hocruxes and why he tries to hunt down Harry relentlesly. Harry represents the possibility of his demise and the Hocruxes secures that he can’t die.   So the question is had Voldemort in his fear of death ever come to terms with death?"

its own sirius allowed his home to be protected this way in deathly hallows after the battle of malfoy manor most homes owned by order members are protected by the fidelius charm with arthur weasley as secret keeper again nobody is having their home protected against their will so going back to ben carlin's example of a door knob being hidden by a fidelius charm my theory is that first of all the owner of that door would first have to consent to having the knowledge of how to use his door hidden and second the charm would only conceal the knowledge of how to use that one specific door knob for every other door knob in the world the knowledge of how to use them would still be publicly available and because their owners aren't consenting to the protection the caster of that charm couldn't hide that information away even if he wanted to so it still can't be used as the ultimate act of trollism as i was typing this thread i noticed that this also inadvertently clears up a plothole in

Ben of the SuperCarlinBrothers wonders if there are any restrictions on what information can be hidden using the Fidelius Charm. He then goes on to suggest ""like, for instance ... how do use a door knob!""  That certainly does sound like the ultimate dick move that an Internet troll might try and pull. But I have a reasonable fan theory that not only defeats that theory, but is totally consistent with how the fidelius charm is used throughout the series.  First ... when hiding an inanimate object, you can only hide specific inanimate objects. Second, the legal owner of that inanimate object must consent to having it hidden away.  Think about it: The first instance we hear of the Fidelius Charm is the hiding of the Potters' Cottage. That cottage was eligible for fidelius charm protection ... because James Potter allowed it to be!  Later, we see 12 Grimmauld Place protected by the fidelius charm. Again, its own (Sirius) allowed his home to be protected this way.  In Deathly Hallows, after the battle of Malfoy Manor, most homes owned by Order members are protected by the Fidelius Charm with Arthur Weasley as secret-keeper. Again, nobody is having their home protected against their will.  So going back to Ben Carlin's example of a door knob being hidden by a fidelius charm ... my theory is that, first of all, the owner of that door would first have to consent to having the knowledge of how to use his door hidden, and second, the charm would only conceal the knowledge of how to use *that one specific door knob.* For every other door knob in the world, the knowledge of how to use them would still be publicly available, and because their owners aren't consenting to the protection, the caster of that charm couldn't hide that information away, even if he wanted to. So it still can't be used as the ultimate act of trollism.  As I was typing this thread, I noticed that this also inadvertently clears up a plothole in Deathly Hallows. After the Battle of Malfoy Manor, Dobby teleports Harry &  Co. to outside Bill Weasley's house. Harry sees bodies moving around inside the house and calls for help. But if Bill was the secret-keeper, Dobby couldn't have revealed the location to Harry, nor could Harry have seen inside the house on his own accord.  However, this suddenly makes sense if we accept that the thing that was hidden wasn't the location of the house itself, but rather, the knowledge of how open the front door. When Bill comes out to respond to Harry's pleas for help, he demonstrates how to open the door to Harry, and so everyone present learns that knowledge. Meanwhile, concealing even that knowledge is still enough to keep the death eaters out. We read about how some death eaters are stationed outside 12 Grimmauld Place in the hopes of catching a glimpse of where it is by an Order member, so like with 12 Grimmauld Place, Bill Weasley's cottage might already be under surveillance by death eaters, but it won't make a lick of difference if they *can't enter the damn thing.*  So what do you guys think?"

During the Quidditch tryouts in HBP, Harry asks McLaggen why he didn’t tryout for keeper the previous year. McLaggen states that he was in the hospital wing after eating a pound of doxy eggs for a bet. This made me think, why would someone eat a pound of doxy eggs and who would even have a pound of dozy eggs at their disposal. Well they first introduced doxies in OOTP when they are cleaning Sirius’s house and we know Fred &  George we’re interested in them for their Skiving Snackboxes and after cleaning the curtains with the doxies they collect a bowl of their eggs. Fred &  George could have easily nicked those intending to experiment with them for their Skiving Snackboxes. Now a couple motives for the twins to make this bet with McLaggen knowing it’ll most likely make him sick, coincidentally right before keeper tryouts.   1. They want to prevent him from trying out because they want Ron to be the keeper.  * Unlikely since I don’t think they knew Ron was trying out for keeper. 2. They want to prevent him from trying out because they don’t like McLaggen and they think he’ll be a cancer on the team, which we see happen in HBP.  3. They just wanted to mess with McLaggen and make a bit of gold off him thinking he can eat a pound of doxy eggs.  * Most likely as we are talking about the twins and you know they wouldn’t pass up an opportunity to mess with someone   TLDR: Fred &  George were the ones who made the bet with McLaggen about eating the doxy eggs during OOTP that prevented him from trying out to be the Gryffindor keeper."

2689,on the nature of divination prophecy and time travel so i've been thinking about all the time related magic portrayed in canon mostly poa and there appear to be  different but connected types divination by generating and interpreting semi random patterns like tea leaves crystal balls etc it's what's taught in divination class and it's what hermione doesn't believe in because it's too wooly although it does seem to create true although not too useful predictions true prophecy we see both the original one and the one  witnesses in poa come true they aren't a semi random pattern but a short piece of text that will eventually come true no matter what although it's impossible to tell just how exactly it will happen the time turner creates a closed time loop where events the time traveler witnessed cannot be changed but the way in which they happen can for example they hear the axe sound and assume that buckbeak got executed and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happening but they can change the reason so that buckbeak survives also  knows for sure that their past selves will be saved since he witnessed it and thus is able to save them since it doesn't change anything the nature of time travel is that anything that has happened that the traveler knows about cannot be changed only things that the traveler doesn't know can since that way it already has happened without the traveler knowing any information about events carried back in time causes the events to happen no matter what the traveler does only details not known to the traveler can be changed just like true prophecies will always happen but details not mentioned in the text of the prophecy can be changed any information carried back in time is essentially a prophecy hermione knows that there will be an axe sound since she has witnessed it and thus it essentially creates a prophecy hermione will hear an axe sound at that moment that cannot be avoided the hp universe by its very nature doesn't allow split timelines if information is carried back in time it cannot prevent itself from happening paradoxes cannot happen you cannot travel back and kill your grandfather and prevent yourself from existing since you exist if you do manage to go back in time and kill your grandfather as a kid then that wasn't your real grandfather both divination and prophecy are probably based on the same magic as time turners but they work in reverse a time turner sends information the person using it back in time divination is magic that fetches random bits of information from the future a pet dying someone leaving prophecy is important information randomly traveling back in time into a seers mind in each case the information from the future will turn true since it's known that it will happen but the details that didn't travel back in time can be changed it all fits together time travel in the hp universe is possible paradox free and when you think about it makes more sense than  of time travel fiction including back to the future and avengers endgame and sorry hermione divination isn't bullshit it's wooly and not too useful since you're pulling random bits of information from the future and placing them into a semi random pattern in front of you but it's a legit form of time magic capable of making accurate predictions at least when you're doing it properly and not just

nature of Divination, Prophecy and Time Travel So, I've been thinking about all the time related magic portrayed in canon (mostly PoA), and there appear to be 3 different, but connected types:  -Divination by generating and interpreting semi-random patterns, like tea leaves, crystal balls, etc. It's what's taught in Divination class and it's what Hermione doesn't believe in because it's too wooly, although it does seem to create true, although not too useful predictions.  -True Prophecy, we see both the original one and the one Harry witnesses in PoA come true. They aren't a semi-random pattern but a short piece of text that will eventually come true, no matter what, although it's impossible to tell just how exactly it will happen.  -The Time Turner creates a closed time loop where events the time traveler witnessed cannot be changed, but the way in which they happen can. For example, they hear the axe sound and assume that Buckbeak got executed and the time turner cannot stop the axe sound from happening, but they can change the reason so that Buckbeak survives. Also, Harry knows for sure that their past selves will be saved since he witnessed it and thus is able to save them since it doesn't change anything.  The nature of time travel is that anything that has happened that the traveler knows about cannot be changed, only things that the traveler doesn't know can since that way it already has happened without the traveler knowing.  Any information about events carried back in time causes the events to happen, no matter what the traveler does. Only details not known to the traveler can be changed.   Just like true Prophecies will always happen, but details not mentioned in the text of the Prophecy can be changed.  **Any information carried back in time is essentially a Prophecy.**  Hermione knows that there will be an axe sound since she has witnessed it, and thus it essentially creates a Prophecy ""Hermione will hear an axe sound at that moment"" that cannot be avoided.  The HP universe, by its very nature, doesn't allow split timelines. If information is carried back in time, it cannot prevent itself from happening. Paradoxes cannot happen.  You cannot travel back and kill your grandfather and prevent yourself from existing, since you exist. If you do manage to go back in time and kill your grandfather as a kid, then that wasn't your real grandfather.  Both Divination and Prophecy are probably based on the same magic as time turners, but they work in reverse: A time turner sends information (the person using it) back in time, Divination is magic that fetches random bits of information from the future (a pet dying, someone leaving), Prophecy is important information randomly traveling back in time into a seers mind.  In each case the information from the future will turn true since it's known that it will happen, but the details that didn't travel back in time can be changed.  It all fits together. Time travel in the HP universe is possible, paradox-free and when you think about it makes more sense than 95% of time travel fiction, including Back to the Future and Avengers: Endgame.   And sorry Hermione, Divination isn't bullshit. It's wooly and not too useful since you're pulling random bits of information from the future and placing them into a semi-random pattern in front of you, but it's a legit form of time magic capable of making accurate predictions.  ...at least when you're doing it properly and not just making stuff up to get better grades."

The actress's name is Claudia Kim and her character seems to have something to do with the wizard circus. Her character is described as a woman who is cursed through a hereditary blood curse to turn into a snake. While reading up about the new character I came across someone's theory (unfortunately I can't find the article again) that her character might one day become the Dark Lord's favorite companion Nagini. So I was wondering what other people thought about this theory, because I think it could have some merit. It could also explain why she is so important to Voldemort and maybe give a back story as to where he found her."

Queenie: Queenie believes Grindelwald's agenda will lead to her and Jacob living happily ever after, but I imagine she will get a rude awakening once she witnesses first hand Grindelwald's methods for achieving his goals. She is definitely not a dark wizard/witch nor do I believe she will become one, so ultimately I think she will betray Grindelwald and sabotage one of his plans when she see's that things are going too far. Maybe Grindelwald captures Tina and forces Queenie to choose between saving/reuniting with her sister or to continue helping his cause so she can inevitably be with Jacob. I know not everybody liked how she was written in this movie but I think they could turn things around with a little tweaking."

Langdon Shaw, the senator's brother felt vindicated that it was the work of witches. He stood [drunkenly] triumphant after his brother was murder by the obscurus and then stood very visibly happy when he arrived at the final scene with all the destruction. The camera makes specific captures of his reaction. He might need a reminder, but I think his memory returns in the future movies (maybe through a prompt, like Kowalski had with Queenie), and might help spur the story.

3222,spoiler corvus/credence twins a different theory twins  it is unlikely that corvus sr would have sent his beloved baby corvus to the us with a maid to be created in an orphange by mary lou  leta lestrange did not need to be on that boat unlike baby corvus she was not in danger as she was not loved by corvus sr  even if she was coruvs sr wouldn't care about her and her being in the us would only give away the identity of baby corvus which was supposedly being hidden from yusuf  baby corvus is probably alive because yusuf still has the scars from the unbreakable vow  so the theory is that corvus sr had twins baby corvus and a squib no one knew about the squib except perhaps the maid  he sent the maid with leta and the squib to the us to be raised by mary lou  everyone would have thought the baby on the boat was baby corvus because leta and the maid were there with him  on the same boat he sent true baby corvus with his aunt which would raise him in the us until fake baby corvus was killed by yusuf she would then bring ture baby corvus back claiming to be her son  corvus sr thought yusuf would eventually trace down and kill the wrong baby in the us thus the need for leta and the maid to be with fake corvus  but the accident happened and the babies were exchanged the aunt eventually came back and told corvus sr that baby corvus had drowned not knowing that that babies had been exchanged  he then mourned the death of his son which he believed had drowned and the knews of the death of baby corvus were spread  because there was no point in protecting the squib he despised corvus sr let the kid be raised by mary lou and brought leta back to england  he didn't know however that that kid was the true baby corvus because leta had never told anyone she had switched the babies  in the dialogue between dumbledore and leta he talks as if corvus was dead yusuf also mentions that someone somehow took him out of the water meaning that the story that was told was that corvus had drowned  leda believed that was a false story created by her father to trick yusuf and that her father believed corvus was still alive in the us as she was the only one who knew about the baby exchange  grindenwald was close to corvus sr and heard the true story from his perspective that corvus had drowned and the squib survived and was in ny being raised as an orphan that is why grindenwald calls credence a squib and doubts he could be the obscurian  after he finds out that creedence is the actual obscurian grindenwald goes after the lestrange book in paris and realizes what had happened he then modifies the family tree to show only  dead son of corvus sr called corvus and brings leta and credende to the pere lachaise where the rumors about credence being a lestrange are proven to be false  that was necessary in order for grindenwald to lead credence into believing he was a dumbledore and to try to kill dumbledore while he is actually true baby corvus  as to the squib he probably did not die he was saved by someone or an animal horned serpent maybe the same animal that destroyed the boat as yusuf might have felt because of his vow the fact that dumbledore says the obscurian needs a brother to replace the obscurus and the fact that leda died also support the theory of twins also we never see the actual baby only the blanket let's now match the story

A different theory (twins):  1 - It is unlikely that Corvus Sr. would have sent his beloved baby Corvus to the US with a maid, to be created in an orphange by Mary Lou.  2 - Leta Lestrange did not need to be on that boat; unlike baby Corvus, she was not in danger, as she was not loved by Corvus Sr.  3- Even if she was, Coruvs Sr. wouldn't care about her, and her being in the US would only give away the identity of baby Corvus, which was supposedly being hidden from Yusuf.  4 - Baby Corvus is probably alive because Yusuf still has the scars from the unbreakable vow.  5 - So the theory is that Corvus Sr. had twins, baby Corvus and a squib. No one knew about the squib, except perhaps the maid.  6 - He sent the maid with Leta and the squib to the US to be raised by Mary Lou.  7 - Everyone would have thought the baby on the boat was baby Corvus, because Leta and the maid were there with him.  4 - On the same boat, he sent true baby Corvus with his aunt, which would raise him in the US until fake baby Corvus was killed by Yusuf. She would then bring ture baby Corvus back claiming to be her son.  5- Corvus Sr. thought Yusuf would eventually trace down and kill the wrong baby in the US, thus the need for Leta and the maid to be with fake Corvus.  6 - But the accident happened and the babies were exchanged. The aunt eventually came back and told Corvus Sr. that baby Corvus had drowned, not knowing that that babies had been exchanged.  7 - He then mourned the death of his son, which he believed had drowned, and the knews of the death of baby Corvus were spread.  8 - Because there was no point in protecting the ""squib"" he despised, Corvus Sr. let the kid be raised by Mary Lou, and brought Leta back to England.  9 - He didn't know however that that kid was the true baby Corvus, because Leta had never told anyone she had switched the babies.  10 - In the dialogue between Dumbledore and Leta, he talks as if Corvus was dead. Yusuf also mentions that ""someone somehow took him out of the water"", meaning that the story that was told was that Corvus had drowned.  11 - Leda believed that was a false story created by her father to trick Yusuf, and that her father believed Corvus was still alive in the US (as she was the only one who knew about the baby exchange).  12 - Grindenwald was close to Corvus Sr., and heard the true story from his perspective: that Corvus had drowned and the squib survived and was in NY being raised as an orphan. That is why Grindenwald calls Credence a squib and doubts he could be the obscurian.  13 - After he finds out that Creedence is the actual obscurian, Grindenwald goes after the Lestrange book in Paris, and realizes what had happened. He then modifies the family tree to show only 1 dead son of Corvus Sr. called Corvus, and brings Leta and Credende to the Pere Lachaise, where the rumors about Credence being a Lestrange are proven to be false.  14 - That was necessary in order for Grindenwald to lead Credence into believing he was a Dumbledore (and to try to kill Dumbledore), while he is actually true baby Corvus.  15 - As to the squib, he probably did not die. He was saved by someone (or an animal? Horned serpent? Maybe the same animal that destroyed the boat) as Yusuf might have ""felt"" because of his vow. The fact that Dumbledore says the Obscurian needs a brother to replace the obscurus, and the fact that Leda died, also support the theory of twins. Also, we never see the actual baby, only the blanket.  Let's now match the story with the prophecy:  ""A Son Cruelly Banished.""  Corvus was not cruelly banished, he was being protected. That reinforces the idea of twins: the squib was cruelly banished.  ""Despair of the Daughter.""  That clearly refers to Leta.  ""Return, great avenger.""  The squib will probably return in the movies. He was maybe raised as a muggle in the US, and we may see him fighting in WWII. Or maybe he actually had magical powers and was raised at Ilvermorny, and that's how we get to see the school.  With winds from the water.”  So, maybe he comes back ""from the water"" on the D-Day to fight Grindenwald in 1944? Maybe he comes back flying on the back of a magical creature...the hornet serpent again?"

3784,theory on maledictus' and how they transform for ever crimes of grindelwald spoilers so i have been thinking and you guys seem to like the idea in this coment https //www reddit  utm_source reddit android that human nagini might be good and the snake nagini evil then i replyed to a comenter i don't want to see anyone downvote him please we where sharing thoughts lets respect everyone's speach plz and proposed the idea that maybe the women and snake nagini and two seperate enteties like when ginny is possested by the memory of tom in cos or maybe she can remember like if she were a spectator like us in a movie theater we can't interact with the movie we can only sit and watch and sees everything snake nagini does but can't interact with her so bassicaly women nagini would be a nice person fearing her condition and fearing that she will lose her humanity in a tweet couldn't find it i swear this acting controversy has made it so much harder to find claudia kim or jk rowling say that nagini will be fighting for her humanity not wanting to turn into the  we know she will become and then i wondered what if maledictus' turn forever into a beast because their beast form wich i have theoriesed of being a seperate entity because the beast wants to be present full time what if the snake wasn't powerfull enough until  years to stay completely into snake form and that the human nagini is powerfull enough to change back into a human and then at some point snake nagini would be more powerfull that human nagini and the snake would be in control this is working great it explains why humain nagini will be afraid of her snake form and maybe we could see her randomly transform into a snake only because the snake entity is itself wanting to be a full time being so to recapitulate when a maledictus is in a form lets say human it has its other form snake of nagini's case in itself and it can see what the other one is doing the same aplyes vice versa then when human nagini transform is at will until the snake's maledictus powers become too powerfull so it isn't that the curse will enevitably transform nagini into a snake but more like the snake will have enough power to stay into snake form forever but the snake can still chose to become humain but since it isn't really her why would she do so maybe the snake gathers more power as she is present in the real world hope this was clear please ask me all of your questions i will love to answer them,theori on maledictus' and how they transform for ever crime of grindelwald spoiler so i have been think and you guy seem to like the idea in thi coment http //www reddit  utm_sourc reddit android that human nagini might be good and the snake nagini evil then i repli to a coment i don't want to see anyon downvot him pleas we where share thought let respect everyone' speach plz and propos the idea that mayb the women and snake nagini and two seper enteti like when ginni is possest by the memori of tom in co or mayb she can rememb like if she were a spectat like us in a movi theater we can't interact with the movi we can onli sit and watch and see everyth snake nagini doe but can't interact with her so bassicali women nagini would be a nice person fear her condit and fear that she will lose her human in a tweet couldn't find it i swear thi act controversi ha made it so much harder to find claudia kim or jk rowl say that nagini will be fight for her human not want to turn into the  we know she will becom and then i wonder what if maledictus' turn forev into a beast becaus their beast form wich i have theories of be a seper entiti becaus the beast want to be present full time what if the snake wasn't powerful enough until  year to stay complet into snake form and that the human nagini is powerful enough to chang back into a human and then at some point snake nagini would be more powerful that human nagini and the snake would be in control thi is work great it explain whi humain nagini will be afraid of her snake form and mayb we could see her randomli transform into a snake onli becaus the snake entiti is itself want to be a full time be so to recapitul when a maledictu is in a form let say human it ha it other form snake of nagini' case in itself and it can see what the other one is do the same aply vice versa then when human nagini transform is at will until the snake' maledictu power becom too powerful so it isn't that the curs will enevit transform nagini into a snake but more like the snake will have enough power to stay into snake form forev but the snake can still chose to becom humain but sinc it isn't realli her whi would she do so mayb the snake gather more power as she is present in the real world hope thi wa clear pleas ask me all of your question i will love to answer them,theori on maledictus' and how they transform for ever crime of grindelwald spoiler so i have been think and you guy seem to like the idea in thi coment http //www reddit  utm_sourc reddit android that human nagini might be good and the snake nagini evil then i repli to a coment i don't want to see anyon downvot him pleas we where share thought let respect everyone' speach plz and propos the idea that mayb the women and snake nagini and two seper enteti like when ginni is possest by the memori of tom in co or mayb she can rememb like if she were a spectat like us in a movi theater we can't interact with the movi we can onli sit and watch and see everyth snake nagini doe but can't interact with her so bassicali women nagini would be a nice person fear her condit and fear that she will lose her human in a tweet couldn't find it i swear thi act controversi ha made it so much harder to find claudia kim or jk rowl say that nagini will be fight for her human not want to turn into the  we know she will becom and then i wonder what if maledictus' turn forev into a beast becaus their beast form wich i have theories of be a seper entiti becaus the beast want to be present full time what if the snake wasn't powerful enough until  year to stay complet into snake form and that the human nagini is powerful enough to chang back into a human and then at some point snake nagini would be more powerful that human nagini and the snake would be in control thi is work great it explain whi humain nagini will be afraid of her snake form and mayb we could see her randomli transform into a snake onli becaus the snake entiti is itself want to be a full time be so to recapitul when a maledictu is in a form let say human it ha it other form snake of nagini' case in itself and it can see what the other one is do the same aply vice versa then when human nagini transform is at will until the snake' maledictu power becom too powerful so it isn't that the curs will enevit transform nagini into a snake but more like the snake will have enough power to stay into snake form forev but the snake can still chose to becom humain but sinc it isn't realli her whi would she do so mayb the snake gather more power as she is present in the real world hope thi wa clear pleas ask me all of your question i will love to answer them,"Theory on Maledictus' and how they transform for ever (Crimes of Grindelwald spoilers) So I have been thinking and you guys seem to like the idea in [this coment](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9ju4bf/the_hero_we_need_right_now/e6u9inb?utm_source=reddit-android) that Human Nagini might be good and the Snake Nagini evil.  Then I replyed to a comenter (I don't want to see anyone downvote him please we where sharing thoughts lets respect everyone's speach plz) and proposed the idea that maybe the Women and Snake Nagini and two seperate enteties (like when Ginny is possested by the memory of Tom in CoS) (or maybe she can remember, like if she were a spectator (like us in a movie theater, we can't interact with the movie, we can only sit and watch) and sees everything Snake Nagini does, but can't interact with her.  So bassicaly Women Nagini would be a nice person fearing her condition and fearing that she will lose her humanity.  In a tweet (couldn't find it I swear this acting controversy has made it so much harder to find) Claudia Kim or JK Rowling say that Nagini will be fighting for her humanity, not wanting to turn into the beasts we know she will become.  And then I wondered, what if Maledictus' turn forever into a beast because their beast form (wich I have theoriesed of being a seperate entity) because the beast wants to be present full time.  What if the Snake wasn't powerfull enough until 25+ years to stay completely into snake form and that the Human Nagini is powerfull enough to change back into a human.  And then, at some point Snake Nagini would be more powerfull that Human Nagini and the Snake would be in control.  (This is working great, it explains why Humain Nagini will be afraid of her snake form and maybe we could see her randomly transform into a snake only because the snake entity is itself wanting to be a full-time being).  So to recapitulate, when a Maledictus is in a form (lets say human) it has its other form (snake of Nagini's case) in itself and it can see what the other one is doing (the same aplyes vice-versa).  Then when Human Nagini transform is at will until the Snake's Maledictus powers become too powerfull, so it isn't that the curse will enevitably transform Nagini into a snake, but more like the Snake will have enough power to stay into Snake form forever, but the Snake can still chose to become humain, but since it isn't really her, why would she do so?  Maybe the snake gathers more power as she is present in the real world.  Hope this was clear, please ask me all of your questions, I will love to answer them."

When you think of other characters who have gone through distress when they were children, they all grew up to be somewhat emotionally unstable. Snape has anger issues and is most of the time emotionally detached. Lupin panics. Sirius rebelled. Nevill was insecure. Even Ron, who had a stable house and a loving family had trouble and was insecure. Now, I haven’t read the books for some while, but from what I recall, he lacked that significant element in his character and when it appeared (because the neglect did cause effects on him) it was brief and not in depth as others characters, which is, i think, is somewhat unrealistic. I don’t know, i just find it odd how he was pretty intact after all those years with Dursleys... i know I wouldn’t be. But i guess it’s a children’s book after all and people cope in different ways. And again, I haven’t really read the books in a while so maybe i missed something."

3779,fawkes so i was sitting the other day after recently finishing re reading the  books and ended up online going through forums based on links between the novels and the upcoming fb movies i was totally fangurling i m a bloke on the revelations around nagini and started thinking about other magical creatures throughout the books and how they could be brought into the movies i came to fawkes and stopped short surely there must be a backstory to be shown for how dumbledore met the phoenix it would all tie in with the   franchise and would be another link in with the  books/films i have a feeling that this would be too good an opportunity to miss for jkr i now imagine newt has something to do with dumbledore and fawkes coming together if this does come about in the upcoming cog it could be along the lines of fawkes being captive in this magical circus and that he is mistreated/abused for the amusement/wonder of the gold paying public newt/dumbledore investigating the snake woman act now known to be nagini witnesses the phoenix being brought on to the stage as a dazzling closing piece of the show and can see how neglected he is and so vows to save him i also think there is a chance fawkes tears which have crazy good healing powers could be being misused in the circus against his will to cure any injuries within the circus including the likes of nagini s venomous bites as seen in ootp with arthur weasley extremely difficult to cure this could also explain how fawkes knew  was in need of his tears in cos after his near deadly battle with the basilisk i m probably thinking way too deeply about this but it would all explain a lot about the relationship between fawkes and dumbledore they were companions through until the latters death whereby fawkes displays his sadness through the phoenix s lament emitting a ghostly and extremely sorrowful song at the loss of his friend before he leaves hogwarts this kind of shows to me that he was there with dumbledore voluntarily of his own will and most likely not as a pet and had a huge understanding of the events ongoing around him displaying compassion and intelligence beyond that of a common pet even for a magical one i did tweet jkr a few days ago with a short question about all of this but understandably and predictably i never got a reply haha does anyone think i m completely wrong or right or have any predictions of their own,fawk so i wa sit the other day after recent finish re read the  book and end up onlin go through forum base on link between the novel and the upcom fb movi i

 I was totally fangurling (I’m a bloke) on the revelations around Nagini, and started thinking about other magical creatures throughout the books and how they could be brought into the movies.   I came to Fawkes, and stopped short. Surely, there MUST be a backstory  to be shown for how Dumbledore met the Phoenix. It would all tie in with the Fantastic Beasts franchise, and would be another link-in with the Potter books/films.   I have a feeling that this would be too good an opportunity to miss for JKR; I now imagine Newt has something to do with Dumbledore and Fawkes coming together. If this does come about in the upcoming CoG, it could be along the lines of Fawkes being captive in this magical circus, and that he is mistreated/abused for the amusement/wonder of the gold-paying public.   Newt/Dumbledore, investigating the ‘Snake-Woman’ act now known to be Nagini, witnesses the Phoenix being brought on to the stage as a dazzling closing-piece of the show, and can see how neglected he is, and so vows to save him.   I also think there is a chance Fawkes’ tears, which have crazy-good healing powers, could be being misused in the circus against his will to cure any injuries within the circus, including the likes of Nagini’s venomous bites (as seen in OotP with Arthur Weasley, extremely difficult to cure).   This could also explain how Fawkes knew Harry was in need of his tears in CoS after his near-deadly battle with the Basilisk...  I’m probably thinking way too deeply about this, but it would all explain a lot about the relationship between Fawkes and Dumbledore, they were companions through until the latters death, whereby Fawkes displays his sadness through the ‘Phoenix’s Lament’, emitting a ghostly and extremely sorrowful song at the loss of his friend before he leaves Hogwarts.   This kind of shows to me that he was there with Dumbledore voluntarily, of his own will, and most likely NOT as a pet, and had a huge understanding of the events ongoing around him, displaying compassion and intelligence beyond that of a common ‘pet’, even for a magical one.   I did tweet JKR a few days ago with a short question about all of this, but understandably and predictably I never got a reply haha.   Does anyone think I’m completely wrong, or right, or have any predictions of their own?"

2898,my suggestions on how to make fb3 and future movies an enjoyable experience for all with the recent news that the third  beats wont be released until  i've been thinking about how they could possible improve upon this series and they have to if they want this thing to stay alive here are a few suggestions i came up with that i personally think could yield good results  make a linear focused and clear story line lets face it the second movie had quite a lot going on too much for the majority of viewers the next few movies each need to have a clear objective and point leave minimal to zero room for the audience to potential get confused by whats happening on screen  trim the fat an extension of my first suggestion some of these characters will have to be put aside jacob nagini theseus and tina should not play key roles at least in the next movie i like jacob but his comedy relief schick is starting to wane a lot of movies sometimes fall into the trap of giving a side character more time than needed sometimes less is more  liven up the lore while i am intrigued by the dumbledore vs grindelwald storyline and what it adds/can add the overall  lore i feel that it's not being presented in an enticing enough way that can keep the general audience wanting to learn more i also feel like there is an overreliance on having to tie everything back into the   story my main example of this is credence potentially being a dumbledore it seems too contrived for my taste i think these movies would be served better if they didn't lean so heavily into lore we already know create/expand new lore explore the world and have stand alone adventure stories that can work on their own and but also loosely tie into the greater plot thats happening in the background these are

until 2021 I've been thinking about how they could possible improve upon this series, and they have to if they want this thing to stay alive. Here are a few suggestions I came up with that I personally think could yield good results.  1) Make a Linear, focused, and clear story line: Lets face it, the second movie had quite a lot going on, too much for the majority of viewers. The next few movies each need to have a clear objective and point; leave minimal to zero room for the audience to potential get confused by whats happening on screen.  2) Trim the fat: An extension of my first suggestion, some of these characters will have to be put aside. Jacob, Nagini, Theseus, and Tina should not play key roles at least in the next movie. I like Jacob but his comedy relief Schick is starting to wane, a lot of movies sometimes fall into the trap of giving a side character more time than needed. Sometimes less is more.  3) Liven up the lore: While I am intrigued by the Dumbledore vs Grindelwald storyline and what it adds/can add the overall potter lore I feel that it's not being presented in an enticing enough way that can keep the general audience wanting to learn more. I also feel like there is an overreliance on having to tie everything back into the harry potter story, my main example of this is Credence potentially being a Dumbledore, it seems too contrived for my taste. I think these movies would be served better if they didn't lean so heavily into lore we already know. Create/expand new lore, explore the world, and have stand-alone adventure stories that can work on their own and but also loosely tie into the greater plot thats happening in the background.

The doctors have done all they could to save her, but the chemio didn't work and her health condition rapidly worsened, but she held on to life despite the pain cause she didn't want to leave little Timmy.   Finally, a few months before Timmy's eleven  birthday, she finally passed away, telling her son goodbye and that she loved him very much.    Both  Timmy and his father are emotionally wrecked, but they hold one cause they ""knew"" that there wasn't anything they could do.      Then, during Timmy's 11 birthday, a very big man called Hagrid appears, and tell little Timmy that he is a wizards and that magic is real.  Timmy then asks if magic could have saved his mother, and after being answered posively (Rowling stated that any muggle disease, cancer included, is trivially easy to heal) he asks Hagrid why no one saved her.

1184,dark theory on the ressurection stone this is something that's for fanfiction purposes but at the same time an interesting concept that's occurred to me at the time everyone was focused on the elder wand and we were so used to the invisibility cloak we never truly went in depth of the stone as we all know each of the hallows held a certain trait that even in the magical world is hard to recreate the problem is each one comes with a particularly deadly consequence from its ability it can be perceived as one of the most beneficial of the hallows and the most dangerous out of the three here's the reasons beneficial the stone as we all know has the ability to call loved ones from the dead however it doesn't truly bring people back to life rather it calls and allows the user to

even be used to help victims identity the killer why it's dangerous now this is only speculation so as far as canon i can't say for certain while there are those who would use the stone for the above reasons again the spirits summoned by it don't like to be called from their afterlife despite that i don't doubt there are those who would be seduced and tempted by its power to the point they would abuse it as a result while strong feelings of love would make the spirit happy to return continuously tethering them to the world of the living and in a sense keeping them prisoner would most likely

Theory on the Ressurection Stone This is something that's for Fanfiction purposes but at the same time an interesting concept that's occurred to me. At the time, everyone was focused on the Elder Wand and we were so used to the Invisibility Cloak, we never truly went in depth of the stone.  As we all know, each of the Hallows held a certain trait that even in the magical world, is hard to recreate. The problem is each one comes with a particularly deadly consequence. From its ability, it can be perceived as one of the most beneficial of the Hallows, and the most dangerous out of the three. Here's the reasons:  Beneficial: The stone, as we all know has the ability to call loved ones from the dead. However it doesn't truly bring people back to life, rather it calls and allows the user to communicate with their spirits. The only true benefit one would find by using the stone is to find closure and acceptance if your loved one died in a freak accident, or was brutally murdered, as it can even be used to help victims identity the killer.  Why it's Dangerous: Now this is only speculation, so as far as canon I can't say for certain. While there are those who would use the stone for the above reasons, again the spirits summoned by it don't like to be called from their afterlife. Despite that, I don't doubt there are those who would be seduced and tempted by its power to the point they would abuse it. As a result, while strong feelings of love would make the spirit happy to return, continuously tethering them to the world of the living and in a sense, keeping them prisoner would most likely cause them become more unhinged and desperate to return. In the Tale of Beetle the Bard, the 2nd brother's fiance was at first happy to be back, but soon grew miserable over time, leading to his suicide.  But say the fiance asked to return and brother ignored her and kept her bound, the desperation of wishing to return to her afterlife would eventually force her to kill him by any means, and breaking the hold on him and the stone.    What do you all think? Is it possible?"

If they never talk after the fight, how do they make the pact? Why would they make it and part ways? And they couldn't make the pact and then fight each other.  My theory: D &  G make the pact not to fight as a sign of their love for each other. They realise Ariana is an obscurial, and have conflicting opinions on what to do about her (study vs help, save her vs use her 'for the greater good' or something like that). Ariana overhears them arguing and releases the obscurus, D &  G try calming her down and resort to magic, accidentally killing her. This is the major thing that rips them apart, also leading them to believe in different ideas.  Remember that we never hear that D &  G fought each other from either of them directly, only from other people who could have been lied to."

In GoF, Dobby mentions trying to find work after being freed from the Malfroys but was constantly refused due to wanting payment before deciding to work at Hogwarts where Harry was located. Question, why didn’t Dobby think of offering his services to Harry? Dobby clearly adores and worships Harry, viewing him as a hero to non-wizard beings such as himself so as far as Dobby was concerned he couldn’t have found a better master than Harry Potter. The first time they met Harry was respectful to Dobby so Dobby wouldn’t expect Harry to mistreat him. Of course there’s the matter of Dobby wanting payment but Harry had enough money that paying Dobby shouldn’t be much of an issue and Dobby didn’t appear to want that much money anyway (asking Dumbledore to lower his wage to a galleon a week). I mean, plot wise a lot of things would’ve been easier for Harry with a servant that could perform magic that wizards couldn’t (like apparating in and out of Hogwarts so Harry could’ve summoned Dobby to the graveyard in GoF to take him away or have Dobby apparate him to Grimauld Place in  OotP when he needed to check on Sirius) so perhaps that’s one reason for Rowling not having Dobby become Harry’s servant"

But after watching it a second time....good lord I love this film.  The opening sequence might be my favorite opening of any Potter film, alongside DH Part 1. The movie had an overall dark and beliebeable tone to it! It felt a hopeless, insecure. Johnny Depp as Grindelwald is phenomenal, and so is Jude Law as Dumbledore.   The music is incredible. I especially noticed the music during the mirror scene with Dumbledore. It was extremely fitting and well made there.   The conflicts felt...real. Many people say they didn't understand Queene's decisions in this movie. I however was totally on board with her character. She loves Jacob so much, she wants to be with him and is pretty much fooling herself by enchanting him. She's scared, confused, and angry at the world and how it is. And when Grindelwald ""agrees"" with her and offers a change - a change that allows her and Jacob to be free - in the world with a very convincing speech, I totally understand her. Especially when Grindelwald plays on fear and what the muggles will do unless they protect themselves.   I overall love this move and I'm seing it again for the 3rd time this weekend :)"

Potter did that to ensure that the power of the Wand will rest with his death.   However, the Elder Wand *can* be mastered in other ways - even Harry's disarming of Draco with bare hands is enough to change the allegiance of the Elder Wand.  So... what if Harry was somehow defeated in his (hopefully long) life? Will Harry's attempt of having its power die with him fail - or will a little defeat *not* affect the allegiance?"

understands Wizarding World universe more than Rowling, its author and creator.  Film critics, casual fans, and even hardcore fans seem to be under the impression that they know better than Rowling and that she is failing this series and keep pointing to major “plot holes”, and I just don’t buy it.   The plot hole gripes I see most often:  1.  ~Minerva McGonnagall shouldn’t be in the film, she was born in 1935~  This one seems to be the most pervasive. First off, the 1935 date is fanon not canon, an actual birth year has never been given in canon. Rather than copy-paste, here is an excellent article with a solid argument that McGonnagall is in fact much older and that it does not violate canon.  https://www.hypable.com/when-was-mcgonagall-born-age/   2.  ~At the end of the film Newt and Co should not have been able to apparate onto Hogwarts grounds~  The answer here is obvious. In the Harry Potter series Dumbledore is not only the sole exception to this rule but he is able to lift those restrictions as well:  “As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.”  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.359  And  ""As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed."" Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.544  It stands to reason that, as Dumbledore is the both the exception to the apparition rule and the executor of its enforcement, he created the rule himself after becoming headmaster, either in response to growing tensions in Grindelwald’s rise to power, as a result of an incident that we are not yet aware of, or due to the need for security during the First Wizarding War.  3.  ~Dumbledore was a transfiguration teacher, not Defense against the dark arts~  Here’s a forehead slapper. Dumbledore taught more than one subject in his history at Hogwarts.  In Book 1 Quirrel is a returning, known professor at Hogwarts and yet it his first year teaching DADA, yet no one seems to have a problem with this. In Crimes of Grindelwald we witnessed the Ministry of Magic banning Dumbledore from the position of professor of DADA, so he changed subjects.  The other issue that comes up is that in Half Blood Prince we learn that Tom Riddle wanted to take over the position of DADA instructor from Galatea Merrythought, who taught at Hogwarts for nearly 50 years. Yet, we do not know that he was in that singular role for his entire tenure. Also, even if it is the only subject that he taught Dumbledore could have taken over for a spell (see what I did there?) due to a sabbatical, illness, vacation etc.. Remember that Hagrid only taught Care of Magical Creatures and yet this was temporarily taken over by Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.  4. ~Accio Niffler shouldn’t work, the spell does not work on living things~  While Accio shouldn’t work on a living thing it would work on the objects that the Niffler was carrying in its pouch:   ""'Accio' only works on inanimate objects. While people or creatures may be indirectly moved by 'Accio-ing'objects that they are wearing or holding, this carries all kinds of risks because of the likelihood of injury to the person or beast attached to an object travelling at close to the speed of light."" -Jk Rowling   This one seems more problematic at first because of the, I must say, fantastic jewelry store scene in the first film. Why didn’t Newt use the spell in that scene? Comic relief people! Haha. No really, I think there was more risk to the Niffler.  In the second film they are out in the open and there is no obstruction between them. Boom.  4. ~The Mirror Of Erised is supposed to show you what you most desire but for Dumbledore it seems to show him the past~  This one is simple, we’ve always known that the Mirror of Erised is multifunctional. Harry Potter Book 1, the mirror shows Harry that the Sorcerer’s Stone was in his pocket. He wasn’t seeing it because he desired to see it there, it was revealing to him a truth of which he was unaware.   Also, Dumbledore is a bad ass wizard with incredible command of magic. Perhaps he just desired to see the past.   5. ~Aurelius what? Dumbledore only had two siblings, Arianna and Aberforth~  I whole heartedly agree with you. Practically speaking the dates do not add up: Dumbledore's father, Percival, was sentenced to life in Azkaban when the three Dumbledore children were still very young. Dumbledore's mother, Kendra, died years later in 1899.  Credence is 18 years old in the first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film, which makes his birth year either 1907 or 1908, it’s not possible.   Why trust the word of Grindelwald, who’s entire character arch has been that of a liar and master manipulator? He definitely did not think that Credence was a Dumbledore in film one, when and how would he have learned this? What’s clear is that Grindelwald is grooming Credence to be his weapon against Dumbledore.   Crimes of Grindelwald was largely about Credence seeking an identity; he begins at his weakest and most vulnerable state his purpose to find his identity, and ultimately Grindelwald empowers him by giving him a false identity through which he can enact Grindelwald’s purpose. It’s an allegory for how people are seduced by fascism. This whole series in fact is an allegory about danger of fascism and eugenics, so Jk Rowling. Consider that the story takes place between 1926-45 which mirrors the rise and fall of European fascism and we are following a tyrant who wants a special class of people to rule.   As to whether there is a parcel of truth in his story.. it could be that the obscurus itself once lived in Arianna, so he’s a Dumbledore in a sense. Ariana means Silver in Welsh and Aurelius means Gold in Latin; we know that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were pursuing alchemical knowledge. My guess is that Grindelwald was somehow using alchemy to extract Ariana’s obscurus which lead to the confrontation that ultimately killed Ariana.  -  Personally, I’m over the moon that Rowling is writing the script. I imagine the knee jerk reaction by critics and fandom against this franchise is largely due to the fact that this is not a traditional film series, this is not Star Wars.  A master author who writes complex ring structured novels has the unprecedented position of having total control of the screenplays. This will end up being a very different movie series because of this, the films will play out like a novel with slower complex reveals that will break the Hollywood mold and upset people along the way, I think that’s s great thing.   Personally, I’m stoked on the series. It has the fandom analyzing and theorizing in a way that hasn’t happened since the Harry Potter book series. We all know Jk Rowling can tell a great story, I can’t wait to see how this one plays out."

Don’t even get me started on how the butchered the Harry/Voldemort duel that should have been the climax of all 8 movies, which ended up being a 10 minute slap fight between the two of them as they flew(?) around Hogwarts.   If I’m thinking about the best duels in cinematic history, less is definitely more. Inigo Montoya Vs the 6 fingered man, the return of the Jedi with Luke and Darth Vader and the emperor, or Aragorn fighting the Uruk-Hai chief.  I know by nature there will have to be a lot of CGI because it’s a wizards duel, I’m just hoping they course correct after the last movie. I’m really hoping they knock it out of the park though!"

A person who would happily kill and eat people. A person who would be loyal to Voldemort.   & #   I do think there's evidence in the books that she had human qualities, though. Her behaviour in the Godric's Hollow chapter of Deathly Hallows was extremely cognizant. She could communicate on a human level.  & #   So could the snake in the zoo in Philosopher's Stone, but still. Nagini seemed to be more than just an average snake.  & #   And Voldemort seemed to really care for her. He couldn't love, but what he felt for Nagini seemed to come closer to it than anything else.   & #   And she was a Horcrux. Meaning she had a bit of Voldemort's soul inside her.   & #   What if, when Voldemort was speaking to Nagini, he wasn't speaking to her but to the big of himself inside her. We know that Horcruxes have sentience. And Voldemort cared for no one other than himself. What if the affection he expressed towards Nagini was really self-love? Maybe Nagini's consciousness is trapped inside the snake, watching everything that's happening, but unable to do anything about it? In that case, what Neville did could be seen as an act of mercy."

I have been a fan of the series since they came out but a couple years ago I listened to the audiobooks through, just for fun. I started listening before sleep, and since I knew the story, the next night I would just  start listening to the part I last remembered before falling asleep.  I have an anxiety disorder, and I often found it hard to fall asleep because I would get frequent racing/spiraling thoughts (about my day, pervasive self criticism, or anything in general). Some nights it got so crippling that I would stay awake for hours, trying to distract myself by playing phone games/scrolling through reddit.  After I started listening before bed, I noticed that it was very easy for me to fall asleep. The story, as read by Mr Jim Dale, is so engaging that I was able to focus on Harry's story instead of counterproductively ruminating on my own.  I now own all the books on Audible and I have listened through hundreds of times. :)"

It’s after Harry was seemingly killed, when Voldemort stands in front of the army of Hogwarts and when all hell breaks loose because of Charlie Weasley and the centaurs and all the other bad ass motherfuckers coming for the rescue.   Harry just jumped under his cloak, everything around him is chaos and he hears Hagrid shouting his name. “Harry! Harry! Where’s Harry?”  A few thoughts on that.  Hagrid thinks Harry is dead. He saw him die. He is SURE Harry is dead. Never has anyone came back from Avada Kedavara.  Around Hagrid the Battle breaks loose again. The fight for the only home he had for the last 50+ years. He had every right just to throw himself into battle and crushing those Death eater sculls.  But his first concern is Harry. Less. Harrys corpse. He loves him so much that even on a battlefield he cannot stand the thought of Harrys body getting damaged any more.   So yeah, Albus Rubeus Potter, you were named after a Headmaster and THE FUCKING BRAVEST AND KINDEST MAN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE who loved me dearly and who would have gladly gave his life for mine. Get on that train and kick some ass."

In book one, the wand that chooses Harry is “brothers” with Voldemort’s wand, and in OotP Harry starts having visions and dreams through the perspective of Voldemort’s main Horcrux, Nagini. It’s possible that when Voldemort killed Harry’s parents, he made Harry himself the Horcrux, because the wizarding world would never suspect it. Further evidence is Harry’s ability to speak to snakes, which is a Slytherin ability (btw Harry was almost sorted into Slytherin).  I think it’s a pretty plausible theory, even if it’s a bit out there."

1875,why is hogsmeade the only all magical settlement in britain i mean it kind of makes no sense that wizards wouldn't congregate around each other you know be with their own kind and stuff as i read the books the implication appears to be that hogsmeade is only able to get away with being an all magical settlement because of its proximity to hogwarts hogwarts is the one wizarding landmark that has to be hidden from muggles at all costs because if a muggle sees it that one reveal will instantly blow the wizarding world's cover all other wizarding landmarks can be seen by muggles and they can be explained away as one contrivance or another but if a muggle were to lay eyes on hogwarts and see children flying around on broomsticks and magical creatures roaming the grounds there is no way to rationalize in your head what you're seeing it's a school of magic and that's all there is to it so to guard against that hogwarts has some of the most extensive anti muggle enchantments known to wizard kind therefore because of this extensive protection hogsmeade is able to be an all magical settlement because well muggles can't be that close to hogwarts ok so that at least makes sense in universe the problem isn't so much how hogsmeade works but rather why it's so exclusive we see during the quidditch world cup that the ministry is able to set up very extensive anti muggle enchantments when they set their minds to it as arthur weasley explains gt it's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting muggle attention we have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times and on a huge occasion like the quidditch world cup it's been a massive organizational problem the trouble is about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup and of course we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all there are places muggles can't penetrate but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and three quarters so we had to find a nice deserted moor and set up as many anti muggle precautions as possible the whole ministry's been working on it for months so it might take a while for the ministry to set the enchantments up but if hogwarts is any indication once they are set up they can be maintained indefinitely kind of like muggle construction projects it may take months maybe even years for muggles to finally complete a construction project but once it's finally completed the building is permanent and can be lived in forever as long as the

Hogsmeade the only all-magical settlement in Britain? I mean ... it kind of makes no sense that wizards wouldn't congregate around each other. You know, be with their own kind and stuff?  As I read the books, the implication appears to be that Hogsmeade is only able to get away with being an all-magical settlement because of its proximity to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the one wizarding landmark that has to be hidden from muggles at all costs, because if a muggle sees it, that one reveal will instantly blow the wizarding world's cover. All other wizarding landmarks can be seen by muggles and they can be explained away as one contrivance or another. But if a muggle were to lay eyes on Hogwarts, and see children flying around on broomsticks and magical creatures roaming the grounds, there is no way to rationalize in your head what you're seeing. It's a school of magic and that's all there is to it.  So to guard against that, Hogwarts has some of the most extensive anti-muggle enchantments known to wizard kind. Therefore, because of this extensive protection, Hogsmeade is able to be an all-magical settlement because ... well ... muggles *can't* be that close to Hogwarts!  Ok, so that at least makes sense in-universe. The problem isn't so much how Hogsmeade works, but rather, why it's so exclusive.  We see during the Quidditch World Cup that the Ministry is able to set up very extensive anti-muggle enchantments when they set their minds to it. As Arthur Weasley explains ...  &gt; It's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup... It's been a massive organizational problem. The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry's been working on it for months.  So it might take a while for the ministry to set the enchantments up, but if Hogwarts is any indication, once they are set up, they can be maintained indefinitely. Kind of like muggle construction projects. It may take months, maybe even years, for muggles to finally complete a construction project, but once it's finally completed, the building is permanent, and can be lived in forever as long as the owners continue to maintain it.  So ... why don't they do that more often? It would certainly make the whole ""hiding from muggles"" part of wizarding life a whole lot easier, don't you think?"

Hi there :)  Another FB theory, I think I discovered something :)  It's easy to assume that Dumbledore got his phoenix Fawkes from his befriended magizoologist who has travelled the world and most likely isn't done rescuing illegaly trafficed animals either... but the timeline fits as well :)  ___________________________________________________________  **The Timeline**   Fawkes was born before 1938, when his tail feathers were given to Mr. Ollivander to eventually fabricate the wands for Tom Riddle and Harry Potter...  Voldemort was born in 1926... which leaves us, since he was born on New Years' Eve, with 11 years. And since the next movie will take place in 1928 - we still have 10 years.  Enough time for Newt to find and give Dumbledore a phoenix egg.   __________________________________________________________   **The Reason**  I believe Newt's reason for this present wasn't just sympathy, knowing Fawkes would be in good hands and that this was his teacher's patronus form... I think he also wants to give him a companion... The reason why Newt and Dumbledore became so close is possibly that they both are lonely people... Dumbledore for being too respected among and having lost most of his family, and Newt for struggling among people.  Yet he has his creatures and eventually finds some good friends... I think he wants Fawkes to not only be a pet, but a true friend to Dumbledore.  And I can't wait to hear that theme again &lt;3 ________________________________________________________________________________"

and do the laundry with it and that doesn't count at the end of chamber of secrets  tricks lucius into freeing dobby how he handles this trickery differs from book to film in the books he puts one of his slimy socks on top of tom riddle's diary and in a fleeting moment of letting his guard down and possibly not fully realizing that it was a sock since it was probably covered in slime to the point of being virtually unrecognizable lucius throws the sock over his head without watching where he's throwing it and dobby happens to catch it in the film he hides the sock inside the pages of the diary causing lucius to intentionally hand the book to dobby not realizing that it contained a sock however regardless of whether you go by the book or the film the important thing is the sock went form lucius's hands directly to dobby's hands now some of you might be thinking well in order of the phoenix hermoine leaves articles of clothing laying around the gryffindor common room in the hopes that some hogwart's house elves will pick them up and therefore become freed the house elves avoid the common room because they don't want to be freed so clearly hermoine's plan would have worked if anyone but dobby actually picked them up actually no i don't think hermoine's plan would have worked think about it hermoine isn't even those house elves' master in the first place she didn't have the authority to free those house elves on dumbledore's behalf even if the house elves were totally willing to accept clothes and be freed that's why  had to trick lucius into giving a sock to dobby rather than just giving his own sock to him rather the reason the house elves refused to clean the gryffindor common room is because they knew what hermoine was trying to do even if her efforts were ultimately futile she can still fuck off with them remember in goblet of fire hermoine told the hogwarts house elves that they have the right to wages and clothes and merely suggesting that to them pissed them off to such a degree that they shoe'd her  and ron out of the kitchen in disgust so i'd imagine her not getting the point and continuing to attempt to free the elves this time whether they

However, I have a fan theory that would actually cause this to make sense: House elves can only be freed if the master gives clothes to the house elf *directly.* Leave a basket of laundry nearby and instruct the house elf to take it and do the laundry with it, and that doesn't count.  At the end of Chamber of Secrets, Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby. How he handles this trickery differs from book to film. In the books, he puts one of his slimy socks on top of Tom Riddle's diary and, in a fleeting moment of letting his guard down (and possibly not fully realizing that it was a sock, since it was probably covered in slime to the point of being virtually unrecognizable), Lucius throws the sock over his head without watching where he's throwing it, and Dobby happens to catch it. In the film, he hides the sock inside the pages of the diary, causing Lucius to intentionally hand the book to Dobby not realizing that it contained a sock.  However, regardless of whether you go by the book or the film, the important thing is ... the sock went form Lucius's hands *directly* to Dobby's hands.  Now, some of you might be thinking ... ""Well, in Order of the Phoenix, Hermoine leaves articles of clothing laying around the Gryffindor Common Room, in the hopes that some Hogwart's house elves will pick them up and therefore become freed. The house elves avoid the common room because they don't want to be freed, so clearly, Hermoine's plan would have worked, if anyone but Dobby actually picked them up."" Actually no, I don't think Hermoine's plan would have worked. Think about it: Hermoine isn't even those house elves' master in the first place. She didn't have the *authority* to free those house elves on Dumbledore's behalf, even if the house elves were totally *willing* to accept clothes and be freed! That's why Harry had to trick Lucius into giving a sock to Dobby, rather than just giving his own sock to him!  Rather, the reason the house elves refused to clean the Gryffindor common room is because ... they knew what Hermoine was trying to do. Even if her efforts were ultimately futile, she can still fuck off with them. Remember, in Goblet of Fire, Hermoine told the Hogwarts house elves that they have the right to wages and clothes, and merely suggesting that to them pissed them off to such a degree that they shoe'd her, Harry, and Ron out of the kitchen in disgust. So I'd imagine her not getting the point and continuing to attempt to free the elves (this time, whether they wanted to be freed or not) would only piss them off even more, even if her efforts to free them wouldn't have worked. Her efforts were still offensive to them.  So what do you think? Does this fan theory make sense to you?"

Anyone agree with this? I honestly don't see how that works in the first place.  If he was Kendra's son by Marvolo (lol), he wouldn't have been a Dumbledore. Kendra wasn't a Dumbledore by blood. If he was Percival's son by Mrs Gaunt, then he wouldn't have been a Gaunt. Even if we assume Mrs Gaunt was her husband's paternal parallel cousin or even his sister, and thus a Gaunt by blood, I don't see how she could have had a child older than Merope by an imprisoned man. Morfin may have been born in 1901 so how would Credence also be?  Thoughts?"

*SPOILERS* i’m just so confused as to why her timeline is so messed up. i see time turner theories, but there’s a maximum amount of time one can spend when using the time turner as to not mess with time itself/person who uses it. even if the ministry enforced the max 5 hour rule post dumbledore/grindelwald duel, wouldn’t her working at hogwarts before her birthday mess with her life path? the history we know of time turners would go against her traveling so far back—the history which, funnily enough, came from mcgonagall herself. see this excerpt from pottermore from professor croaker, unspeakable in charge of time (written by jo herself..sorry for formatting, i’m on mobile):  •”It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”. Finally, there were alarming signs, during the days following Madam Mintumble’s recovery, that time itself had been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up and since that time, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those studying time travel.  SO.  i get wanting to have a little wink to harry’s era, but i don’t understand having the familiarity component if it doesn’t add up to what we’ve learned from canon. we see what too much time travel can do (ex. cursed child...i know this is a contentious reference, sorry). i love mcgonagall so much (she’s the witch version of my middle school english teacher, who i adored) and i love her story, so i’m just kind of annoyed to have a wrench thrown into it haha.   so what do y’all think: continuity mess up or a grand time turner plot that will have a wonky explanation? i know some people are saying it doesn’t matter in the long run, but sloppiness is definitely concerning."

In the latest trailer, Grindelwald says ""There arrogance is a key to our victory"".  I think he is talking about muggles when he says 'there'.  As Seamus says in his theory, Grindelwald will stop attacking the Wizarding world and start disturbing the Muggle world instead.  Maybe he is controlling The German chancellor of 1933 (not going to type his name here though).  In the part 'History' of this [fandom](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Inferius) page says that Grindelwald wanted an inferius army and in the years 1939 - 1945 we know a lot of people were killed at the fronts and in the camps  I think it is possible that Grindelwald used these bodies to build his army.

2484,what are personality traits of   characters that are often glossed over or forgotten about by the fan base i thought this would be an interesting question we discuss the hp characters a lot but one of the great things about jkr's writing is that characters mostly feel like real people with positives and negatives and many layers to their personalities however in saying that it happens quite often that smaller personality traits are often forgotten or not discussed for instance we know hermione loves books that is a key characteristic of hers that we all know but are there any traits hermione has shown over the course of the books that are not widely discussed or known an example i have is with luna everyone thinks of her as a bit airy and someone that is very open minded and things like that and she is for the most part but luna has a trait in her personality where she does not like people questioning her beliefs this is one example gt anything good in there asked ron as  closed the magazine gt of course not said hermione scathingly before  could answer gt the quibbler s rubbish everyone knows that gt excuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality my father s the editor gt i oh said hermione looking embarrassed well it s got some interesting i mean it s quite gt i ll have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forward she snatched it out of  s hands rifling through it to page fiftyseven she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it i mean this is not the greatest example but it shows luna is capable of anger and i do recall other instances where she gets angry or annoyed when someone suggests her beliefs might not be real it isn't something that happens much probably only a few times in the entire of the last  books but it is a characteristic of hers one not often discussed here is an example of hermione's more light hearted side we almost never see and is not widely discussed gt the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until they d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig gt malfoy s got detention i could sing gt don t  advised her i mean can you imagine hermione doing a little jig i mean she did one and it is almost hard to imagine but it shows that being silly is part of hermione a part she tries to hide another example gt wha yeah of course he said pulling himself together gt well okay if i can t get slughorn to talk this afternoon i ll take some felix and have another go this evening gt that s decided then said hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette destination determination deliberation she murmured gt oh stop that ron begged her i feel sick enough as it is quick hide me gt it isn t lavender said hermione impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and ron dived behind her missed it gt that s decided then said hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette can anyone imagine hermione doing a graceful pirouette i mean it

that i think we as fan often forget so what are some littl discuss person characterist of the hp charact that you would like to draw attent to,"What are personality traits of Harry Potter characters that are often glossed over or forgotten about by the fan base? I thought this would be an interesting question. We discuss the HP characters a lot but one of the great things about JKR's writing is that characters mostly feel like real people, with positives and negatives and many layers to their personalities.  However, in saying that it happens quite often that smaller personality traits are often forgotten or not discussed. For instance, we know Hermione loves books, that is a key characteristic of hers that we all know, but are there any traits Hermione has shown over the course of the books that are not widely discussed or known?  An example I have is with Luna. Everyone thinks of her as a bit airy, and someone that is very open minded and things like that, and she is for the most part, but Luna has a trait in her personality where she does not like people questioning her beliefs. This is one example  &gt;“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.  &gt;“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer,  &gt;“The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.”  &gt;“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality. “My father’s the editor.”  &gt;“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .”  &gt;“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fiftyseven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it  I mean this is not the greatest example, but it shows Luna is capable of anger, and I do recall other instances where she gets angry or annoyed when someone suggests her beliefs might not be real. It isn't something that happens much, probably only a few times in the entire of the last 3 books, but it is a characteristic of hers, one not often discussed.  Here is an example of Hermione's more light hearted side we almost never see and is not widely discussed  &gt;The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.  &gt;“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”  &gt;“Don’t,” Harry advised her.  I mean can you imagine Hermione doing a little jig? I mean she did one, and it is almost hard to imagine, but it shows that being silly is part of Hermione, a part she tries to hide.  Another example  &gt;“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself together.  &gt;“Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.”  &gt;“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. “Destination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .” she murmured.  &gt;“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!”  &gt;“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.  Missed it?  &gt;“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette  Can anyone imagine Hermione doing a graceful pirouette? I mean it just doesn't seem like a Hermione thing to do, but it is another example of her being silly, or just having fun that I think we as fans often forget.  So, what are some little discussed personality characteristics of the HP characters that you would like to draw attention to?"

3691,who is credence theory crazy theory what if aurelius/credence/corvis/whoever the fuck he is was created by nicholas flamel he s clearly incredibly powerful and an alchemist allusion to aurelius which means gold plus we know jk rowling infuses meaning into her characters names he also created the philosopher s stone which has the power to restore life so would he have the power to maybe create a life too say in theory dumbledore and flamel wanted to create a wizard who could take down grindelwald should he get too powerful they could have used some of dumbledore s dna so he would have powerful blood and it explains the phoenix plus i saw someone on here saying maybe dumbledore or grindelwald captured the obscurial from ariana when she died so if we entertain that theory and say dumbledore somehow took it and passed it on to credence maybe even accidentally we also know that as loveable as dumbledore is he is a very complex multi faceted character who is prepared to go to extremes to defeat dark magic ie raising  knowing he would get killed and also ad was involved in the killing of ariana so we know he is far from perfect this is admittedly hugely unlikely but it s a theory that would explain everything i think and explains why nicolas flamel has been introduced into the storyline further he knows that he can t fight grindelwald because of the blood pact which is a dilemma because he s the only one who was powerful enough to him and flamel together could ve thought that they could ve created a wizard so great that they could control the obscurion edit also credence s evil adopted mother is called mrs barebone reference to perhaps him being created from a bare bone,who is credenc theori crazi theori what if aurelius/credence/corvis/whoev the fuck he is wa creat by nichola flamel he s clearli incred power and an alchemist allus to aureliu which mean gold plu we know jk rowl infus mean into her charact name he also creat the philosoph s stone which ha the power to restor life so would he have the power to mayb creat a life too say in theori dumbledor and flamel want to creat a wizard who could take down grindelwald should he get too power they could have use some of dumbledor s dna so he would have power blood and it explain the phoenix plu i saw someon on here say mayb dumbledor or grindelwald captur the obscuri from ariana when she die so if we entertain that theori and say dumbledor somehow took it and pass it on to credenc mayb even accident we also know that as loveabl as dumbledor is he is a veri complex multi facet charact who is prepar to go to extrem to defeat dark magic ie rais  know he would get kill and also ad wa involv in the kill of ariana so we know he is far from perfect thi is admittedli huge unlik but it s a theori that would explain everyth i think and explain whi nicola flamel ha been introduc into the storylin further he know that he can t fight grindelwald becaus of the blood pact which is a dilemma becaus he s the onli one who wa power enough to him and flamel togeth could ve thought that they could ve creat a wizard so great that they could control the obscurion edit also credenc s evil adopt mother is call mr barebon refer to perhap him be creat from a bare bone,who is credenc theori crazi theori what if aurelius/credence/corvis/whoev the fuck he is wa creat by nichola flamel he s clearli incred power and an alchemist allus to aureliu which mean gold plu we know jk rowl infus mean into her charact name he also creat the philosoph s stone which ha the power to restor life so would he have the power to mayb creat a life too say in theori dumbledor and flamel want to creat a wizard who could take down grindelwald should he get too power they could have use some of dumbledor s dna so he would have power blood and it explain the phoenix plu i saw someon on here say mayb dumbledor or grindelwald captur the obscuri from ariana when she die so if we entertain that theori and say dumbledor somehow took it and pass it on to credenc mayb even accident we also know that as loveabl as dumbledor is he is a veri complex multi facet charact who is prepar to go to extrem to defeat dark magic ie rais  know he would get kill and also ad wa involv in the kill of ariana so we know he is far from perfect thi is admittedli huge unlik but it s a theori that would explain everyth i think and explain whi nicola flamel ha been introduc into the storylin further he know that he can t fight grindelwald becaus of the blood pact which is a dilemma becaus he s the onli one who wa power enough to him and flamel togeth could ve thought that they could ve creat a wizard so great that they could control the obscurion edit also credenc s evil adopt mother is call mr barebon refer to perhap him be creat from a bare bone,"Who is credence? - theory CRAZY THEORY: What if Aurelius/Credence/Corvis/whoever the fuck he is, was created by Nicholas Flamel. He’s clearly incredibly powerful and an alchemist (allusion to Aurelius which means gold) - plus we know JK Rowling infuses meaning into her characters’ names. He also created the Philosopher’s Stone which has the power to ‘restore life’ so would he have the power to maybe create a life too? Say in theory Dumbledore and Flamel wanted to create a wizard who could take down Grindelwald should he get too powerful they could have used some of Dumbledore’s DNA - so he would have powerful blood and it explains the Phoenix. Plus I saw someone on here saying maybe Dumbledore or Grindelwald captured the Obscurial from Ariana when she died - so if we entertain that theory and say Dumbledore somehow took it and passed it on to Credence (maybe even accidentally).   We also know that as loveable as Dumbledore is, he is a very complex multi-faceted character who is prepared to go to extremes to defeat dark magic - ie raising Harry knowing he would get killed and also AD was involved in the killing of Ariana so we know he is far from perfect.  This is admittedly hugely unlikely, but it’s a theory that would explain everything (I think) and explains why Nicolas Flamel has been introduced into the storyline.   Further, he knows that he can’t fight Grindelwald because of the blood pact, which is a dilemma because he’s the only one who was powerful enough to. Him and Flamel together could’ve thought that they could’ve created a wizard so great that they could control the obscurion.  EDIT: also Credence’s evil adopted mother is called ‘Mrs Barebone’ - reference to perhaps him being created from a bare bone"

1379,theory on the sorting hat and prophecies so i've recently been listening to the   audio books after first reading the books  years ago i've also been rewatching the films and reading this sub and it's gotten me thinking i know there has previously been discussion on how the sorting hat knows which house to sort you in e g on your values but most of what we know from the sorting hat is from what it tells us in it's songs ' ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me ' 'there s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can t see' ' i sort you into houses because that is what i m for but this year i ll go further ' so from the above we know the sorting hat is very clever or thinks it is can see everything inside your head and can prophesise the further if you consider its warning a prophecy so my theory is that the sorting hat sorts you into the house that matches your life's most defining action it can see in your head your potential future life sees your most defining action and which quality this is and creates a self fulfilling prophecy by sorting you into that house and making you therefore value that quality the most for example i believe the most defining moment in neville's life is killing nagini and this showed bravery snape you could argue was really a brave hero so why wasn't he in gryffindor he only switched to the 'good' side for his own selfish reasons and creepy love of lily it wasn't out of true bravery or loyalty james in gryffindor even tho we was a bit of an arrogant wanker at school his defining moment was being brave standing up to voldemort peter in gryffindor as his defining moment was helping  draco in slytherin as his defining moment was in my opinion his actions in hbp as his family regaining status is his main motivation your teenage years are some of your most important for brain development so i think as being in your hogwarts house becomes such a large part of your identity in these years the qualities associated with your house define you we've seen self fulfilling prophecies before with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which voldemort fulfils by hearing it and trying to kill  and you could argue many events wouldn't have been able to happen if the hat hadn't sorted students the way it had e g if hermione had been sorted into ravenclaw would  and ron been able to defeat voldemort also the maurders being sorted together death eaters being sorted together etc to take it a bit further i believe the sorting hat considered putting  in slytherin partly because of voldermort's soul fragment but also because it could see  owning all  of the hallows and it had to decide whether  would use this selfishly to take power or if he would use them for good once  asked to be in gryffindor the sorting hat knew  would use the hallows for good i also have another theory that  is the only true owner of the elder wand that could potentially overcome the whole wandlore slight plot hole thing so in conclusion i believe the sorting hat has divination powers and creates a self fulfilling prophecy for each student based on the most important action of their life of course this sometimes fails and a student goes against their 'destiny' such as regulus black however for most students their house quality will become a major part of their identity therefore shaping their lives and futures,theori on the sort hat and propheci so i'v recent been listen to the   audio book after first read the book  year ago i'v also been rewatch the film and read thi sub and it' gotten me think i know there ha previous been discuss on how the sort hat know which hous to sort you in e g on your valu but most of what we know from the sort hat is from what it tell us in it' song

from the abov we know the sort hat is veri clever or think it is can see everyth insid your head and can prophesis the further if you consid it warn a propheci so my theori is that the sort hat sort you into the hous that match your life' most defin action it can see in your head your potenti futur life see your most defin action and which qualiti thi is and creat a self fulfil propheci by sort you into that hous and make you therefor valu that qualiti the most for exampl i believ the most defin moment in neville' life is kill nagini and thi show braveri snape you could argu wa realli a brave hero so whi wasn't he in gryffindor he onli switch to the 'good' side for hi own selfish reason and creepi love of lili it wasn't out of true braveri or loyalti jame in gryffindor even tho we wa a bit of an arrog wanker at school hi defin moment wa be brave stand up to voldemort peter in gryffindor as hi defin moment wa help  draco in slytherin as hi defin moment wa in my opinion hi action in hbp as hi famili regain statu is hi main motiv your teenag year are some of your most import for brain develop so i think as be in your hogwart hous becom such a larg part of your ident in these year the qualiti associ with your hous defin you we'v seen self fulfil propheci befor with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which voldemort fulfil by hear it and tri to kill  and you could argu mani event wouldn't have been abl to happen if the hat hadn't sort student the way it had e g if hermion had been sort into ravenclaw would  and ron been abl to defeat voldemort also the maurder be sort togeth death eater be sort togeth etc to take it a bit further i believ the sort hat consid put  in slytherin partli becaus of voldermort' soul fragment but also becaus it could see

i also have anoth theori that  is the onli true owner of the elder wand that could potenti overcom the whole wandlor slight plot hole thing so in conclus i believ the sort hat ha divin power and creat

and Prophecies So i've recently been listening to the Harry Potter audio books after first reading the books 8 years ago. I've also been rewatching the films and reading this sub and it's gotten me thinking...  & #   I know there has previously been discussion on how the Sorting Hat knows which house to sort you in e.g. on your values. But most of what we know from the sorting hat is from what it tells us in it's songs:  '*’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.'*  *'There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see'*  '*I sort you into Houses Because that is what I’m for, But this year I’ll go further,'*  So from the above we know the Sorting Hat is very clever (or thinks it is), can see everything inside your head and can prophesise the further (if you consider its warning a prophecy).  So my theory is that the Sorting Hat sorts you into the house that matches your life's most defining action.  It can see in your head your potential future life, sees your most defining action and which quality this is and creates a self fulfilling prophecy by sorting you into that house and making you therefore value that quality the most.  For example, I believe the most defining moment in Neville's life is killing Nagini, and this showed bravery.  Snape you could argue was really a brave hero so why wasn't he in Gryffindor? He only switched to the 'good' side for his own selfish reasons and creepy love of Lily. It wasn't out of true bravery or loyalty  James in Gryffindor even tho we was a bit of an arrogant wanker at school? His defining moment was being brave standing up to Voldemort.  Peter in Gryffindor as his defining moment was helping Harry.  Draco in Slytherin as his defining moment was, in my opinion, his actions in HBP, as his family regaining status is his main motivation.  Your teenage years are some of your most important for brain development so I think as being in your Hogwarts House becomes such a large part of your identity in these years the qualities associated with your house define you.  We've seen self fulfilling prophecies before with the whole 'neither can live while the other survives' which Voldemort fulfils by hearing it and trying to kill Harry.  And you could argue many events wouldn't have been able to happen if the hat hadn't sorted students the way it had. E.g. if Hermione had been sorted into Ravenclaw would Harry and Ron been able to defeat Voldemort? Also the maurders being sorted together, death eaters being sorted together etc.  To take it a bit further I believe the Sorting Hat considered putting Harry in Slytherin partly because of Voldermort's soul fragment, but also because it could see Harry owning all 3 of the Hallows, and it had to decide whether Harry would use this selfishly to take power, or if he would use them for good. Once Harry asked to be in Gryffindor the sorting hat knew Harry would use the Hallows for good (I also have another theory that Harry is the only true owner of the Elder Wand that could potentially overcome the whole Wandlore slight plot hole thing)  So in conclusion I believe the Sorting Hat has divination powers and creates a self fulfilling prophecy for each student based on the most important action of their life. Of course this sometimes fails and a student goes against their 'destiny' such as Regulus Black, however for most students their house quality will become a major part of their identity therefore shaping their lives and futures."

Luck is well... luck. However, Felix is banned from organizational sports for a reason. It gives the player who drinks it an unfair advantage. Why? Even if that player is one of the best in the world, like Viktor Krum, he would only be able to win the Quidditch World Cup if Bulgaria did better and Ireland did worse. Felix not only affects the drinker but those associated with his/her endgame for the day. If Krum drank Felix during the world cup, the other team would likely blunder some goals and Krum would have snatched that snitch much quicker.   On the day Harry takes lucky potion to get the memory from Slughorn, Filch accidentally forgets to lock the doors, something I would think he would never do considering his hatred towards breaking the rules. He broke a rule of his own.   Felix doesn't just render a person lucky, it makes those who are in the way of the drinker's goals unlucky."

So Grindelwald wants Credence to kill Dumbledore... but like.. how?  Magically speaking, we know Credence is nowhere powerful enough to kill Albus Dumbledore. Credence, in his genuine rage, couldn't even hurt that beast hunter who killed the half-elf nurse.  If Grindelwald was going for an emotional trauma/guilt-about-Ariana angle, that doesn't work either because, according to the interview of Yates, Dumbledore has no idea who Aurelius Dumbledore is.  So what on earth was Grindelwald planning to do? Show up at Hogwarts with Credence, do a 5-min powerpoint presentation about how Credence is indeed related to Dumbledore before ordering Credence to fight? Except...that would totally blow off his lie to Credence about Credence's brother wanting to destroy him.  No matter how I look at it, I don't see how Grindelwald imagines Credence will be able to kill Dumbledore."

scene where Molly hugs Harry... I’ve been listening to the Stephen Fry narrated audiobooks and I am enjoying the story (again) so very much. I love how I find something new on each read through.   I just listened to “The Parting of the Ways”, chapter 36 of The Goblet of Fire, and was struck by how poignant the scene where molly hugs Harry is:  “The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to over him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.  ‘It wasn’t your fault, Harry,’ Mrs Weasley whispered.  ‘I told him to take the cup with me,’ said Harry.  Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away.  Mrs Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing his face up against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.  There was a loud slamming noise , and Mrs Weasley and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand. ‘Sorry,’ she whispered.”  Does anyone know why Hermione says sorry? I’ve always interpreted this passage to mean that she intentionally made the sound to break Harry and Molly apart, but I’m not sure why? How does everyone else interpret this scene?   Also, this has got to be a condenser for one of my favourite scenes in the entire series. The howl of misery..being hugged as if by a mother. So vivid and heartbreaking. Anyone else have any favourites similar to this?"

Can someone tell me where the Hogwarts backstory for Newt &  Leta that's been floating around since shortly after AWTFT came out came from?  I refer to how it goes: they met at Hogwarts, had a lot in common, were both seen as misfits &  outcasts, both were interested in creatures; they became close, Newt fell in love with Leta. Then there was an incident with a Jarvey that Leta was responsible for, and another student was hurt/endangered.  Newt decided to take the fall for what Leta actually did, and was expelled from Hogwarts as a result.  Because Leta ""was a taker"", this ended their relationship and broke Newt's heart.   We know now that much of this story did happen, but there's still much we don't know about what really went on between Newt and Leta. Was this backstory put out somewhere, say on Pottermore, or did JKR tell it in an interview?  I have never been able to find it anywhere.  & #"

Ffs. Its so infuriating and its not even my slytherin bias, it could've been amazing to have a character out of there that would've made harry and by consequence Ronald to get the stick out of their assess and accept that while they do desk with scumbag snakes, their own prejudice of the green and silver house is just equally annoying.  I feel like a slytherin involved in their shenanigans would've been an amazing influence to add some cunning and structure in their bullshit Lion approach to everything barrelling in and hoping everything goes right. But nope all we get is draco, his two mini trolls henchmen, pansy the groupie and a glimpse of Theodore and Blaise.  I am an adult and i can understand not to share Harry's opinion but since the books ARE for children i doubt their won't eat up the assumption that ""Slytherin man bad"" thing."

3604,theory about aurelius dumbledore i saw the movie yesterday and read many theories here in reddit taking ideas from them i have tried to put one that seems most plausible thing we know or can safely assume ariana dumbledore was an obscurial gellert grindelwald was very much into dark twisted experiments he was expelled from durmstrang a school famous for its tolerance of dark arts albus dumbledore was a brilliant wizard he wanted to escape from his responsibilities and seek glory he felt trapped and wasted with grindelwald he saw a chance of being part of a revolution they both sought the deathly hallows of course their reasons were different albus turned a blind eye towards what he suspected grindelwald was for the greater good and now the guessing part based on the theories i read here grindelwald convinces albus to take out the obscurus out of ariana aberforth interrupts them and then there is a duel i am guessing grindelwald leaves with the obscurus but it is useless for him without a host obscurus are rare so he wouldn't give up that easily he thinks a sibling can act as one people are generally rejecting aurelius being a sibling based on percival being in azkaban and dying there they think grindelwald was lying to credence but i believe aurelius can be son of percival why because a dark powerful wizard wants it to be so breaking out of azkaban is not impossible sirius maybe the first who did it without outside help it wouldn't be difficult for someone like grindelwald to come up with a plan to free percival bartemius crouch did a similar thing yes percival was a man of honour but after all these years in azkaban we don't know how resistant he would be to an imperius curse or love potion or whatever so a son is born and he is given a proper name aurelius i am guessing grindelwald tried to make the boy a host for the obscurus but by now percival has started to fight against whatever spell he is under he finds out grindelwald is after aurelius and arranges to ship him to america with honoria dumbledore grindelwald follows them maybe there is a duel and percival dies we know what happens next ship carrying aurelius sinks grindelwald believes that he died so years later grindelwald foresees another obscurial in new york believing no obscurial could live that longer he doesn't think him to be aurelius but after he finds out he decides to use him against albus dumbledore whatever be the backstory i think this franchise is gonna be great for the fans there is so much to look forward to like the reaction of albus when he comes to know about aurelius maybe seeing the pain he is in he decides to do something he couldn't do before to save ariana maybe there is a reason why albus dumbledore considers love as the most powerful force phoenix are extremely loyal and would depart to find their own paths if their owners die rather than finding a new master however i choose to believe that in this case albus at least tries to do something so great for aurelius that his phoenix which i love to think is fawkes makes albus his new master what albus sees in mirror of erised is his family that is his deepest desire reason why his patronus is phoenix symbol of dumbledore family,theori about aureliu dumbledor i saw the movi yesterday and read mani theori here in reddit take idea from them i have tri to put one that seem most

which i love to think is fawk make albu hi new master what albu see in mirror of eris is hi famili that is hi deepest desir reason whi hi patronu is phoenix symbol of dumbledor famili,"Theory about Aurelius Dumbledore I saw the movie yesterday and read many theories here in reddit. Taking ideas from them I have tried to put one that seems most plausible. Thing we know or can safely assume:  \* Ariana Dumbledore was an obscurial.  \* Gellert Grindelwald was very much into dark twisted experiments. He was expelled from Durmstrang, a school famous for its tolerance of Dark Arts.  \* Albus Dumbledore was a brilliant wizard. He wanted to escape from his responsibilities and seek glory. He felt trapped and wasted. With Grindelwald he saw a chance of being part of a revolution. They both sought the Deathly Hallows. Of course their reasons were different. Albus turned a blind eye towards what he suspected Grindelwald was ""for the greater good"".  & #   And now the guessing part based on the theories I read here.  & #   Grindelwald convinces Albus to take out the obscurus out of Ariana. Aberforth interrupts them and then there is a duel. I am guessing Grindelwald leaves with the obscurus. But it is useless for him without a host. Obscurus are rare so he wouldn't give up that easily. He thinks a sibling can act as one. People are generally rejecting Aurelius being a sibling based on Percival being in Azkaban and dying there. They think Grindelwald was lying to Credence. But I believe Aurelius can be son of Percival. Why? Because a dark powerful wizard wants it to be so. Breaking out of Azkaban is not impossible. Sirius maybe the first who did it without outside help. It wouldn't be difficult for someone like Grindelwald to come up with a plan to free Percival. Bartemius Crouch did a similar thing. Yes, Percival was a man of honour but after all these years in Azkaban we don't know how resistant he would be to an Imperius curse or love potion or whatever.   	So a son is born and he is given a proper name Aurelius. I am guessing Grindelwald tried to make the boy a host for the obscurus. But by now Percival has started to fight against whatever spell he is under. He finds out Grindelwald is after Aurelius and arranges to ship him to America with Honoria Dumbledore. Grindelwald follows them, maybe there is a duel and Percival dies. We know what happens next ship carrying Aurelius sinks. Grindelwald believes that he died.  	So years later Grindelwald foresees another obscurial in New York. Believing no obscurial could live that longer he doesn't think him to be Aurelius. But after he finds out he decides to use him against Albus Dumbledore.   	Whatever be the backstory I think this franchise is gonna be great for the fans. There is so much to look forward to. Like the reaction of Albus when he comes to know about Aurelius. Maybe seeing the pain he is in he decides to do something he couldn't do before to save Ariana. Maybe there is a reason why Albus Dumbledore considers love as the most powerful force. Phoenix are extremely loyal and would depart to find their own paths if their owners die, rather than finding a new master. However I choose to believe that in this case Albus at least tries to do something so great for Aurelius that his phoenix which I love to think is Fawkes makes Albus his new master. What Albus sees in mirror of erised is his family. That is his deepest desire. Reason why his patronus is phoenix, symbol of Dumbledore family."

Especially the 2nd World War and the Atomic bomb. How did Grindelwald know this stuff? I think he traveled time. Someone on reddit said one day, that he thinks, time travel will be a big deal in CoG because the word ""time"" is used several times in the trailer and we hear a clicking clock. I've watched the movie and we see a lot of clocks, but nobody is talking about time travel.   Then I see Grindelwald and Dumbledore. They are nearly the same age, right? But Dumbledore looks good in 1929, while Grindelwald looks much older - and whats wrong with his eye?   So maybe he traveled time?! That would explain why he looks older and more used and why he knows the stuff, that happens in the 40s in Europe and Nagasaki...  ##   & #"

At the beginning of DH they have to disguise Harry by having everyone else take polyjuice potion because he still has the trace on him. But, we learned in OotP that the trace isn’t specific to the wizard - they can tell where magic is happening but not who did it.  Case in point (as explained in OotP) Dobby’s floating cake got pinned on Harry only because he should have been the only wizard/magical creature on privet dr.  But, generally speaking it is up to the parent to ensure that under age wizards are following the rules were not in school.  Therefore, why could Harry not simply apparate to the Weasley‘s house from privet Drive?"

See Snape. There are many legitimate arguments showcasing just how ruthless Albus really was.  I want to focus on one. Snape.  The popular question is why is such a terrible person is even allowed to teach the students. He clearly doesn’t like kids, and clearly doesn’t treat them right.   Why would Dumbledore allow this? He had no choice.  In the moment Snape begged Dumbledore to save Lily’s life - Dumbledore, ever the opportunist, asked what Snape would do for him.  😂  So cold. Honestly. That’s cold, methodical, ruthless af. And when Snape said anything, Dumbledore knew Snape was his ace. He needed Snape at Hogwarts, not bc he wanted him there, but bc he needed to make sure Snape wouldn’t bolt on the agreement.  Someone as miserable as Snape probably tried to get away. But Dumbledore couldn’t let him. And so Snape lashed out at the most innocent - the students.  Dumbledore trapped him there.  I dare say neither of them actually liked each other. It’s been awhile since I read canon, so I’m theorizing off I remember. Thoughts?"

126, should have been restricted from competing in the triwizard tournament disclaimer the fourth book is probably my favorite overall however that hasn't shut my eyes to what is arguably one of the biggest plot contrivances of the entire series  mysteriously getting his name put into the goblet and then having to compete in the triwizard tournament regardless of whether he wanted to or not despite being under the established age limit all so he can win the tournament and get whisked off to voldemort by a portkey trophy indeed now i am fully aware of the fact that having your name come out of the goblet is a binding magical contract break the contract something bad happens that's fine but let's look at this closer did  really have to compete for starters the definition of competing in the triwizard tournament is never made clear dumbledore warns the students that once you are in i e your name is selected by the goblet you have to see the tournament through to the end but that's about it now on its face that looks like enough  name comes out of the goblet and so he has to stick it out and compete just like dumbledore said however as the book goes on it quickly becomes clear that things aren't that simple first it is established quite early on that cheating does not constitute a violation of the triwizard contract as all four champions learn about the dragons in the first task beforehand and nothing bad happens to them second and more importantly it is also established that outsider interference with competitors in the tournament that renders competitors unable to compete does not constitute a violation of the triwizard contract this is demonstrated in the third task when barty crouch jr uses spells against both fleur delacour and viktor krum that prevent them from competing in the task so that  can get to the portkey first so if both cheating and outsider interference do not count as violations of the definition of competing in the triwizard tournament at least as far as the goblet is concerned this also suggests that the tournament organizers had at their disposal means of restricting  from competing in the tournament that would not have caused  to break the binding magical contract from the goblet for instance the organizers could have placed  under some sort of spell at the beginning of each task to prevent him from taking part in said tasks why would they want to do this in the first place because as karkaroff and madame maxime point out  taking part gives hogwarts an unfair advantage two champions as opposed to the one each for beauxbatons and durmstrang if  didn't really have to compete then there was no reason for the organizers to not seek out some roundabout way of restricting his participation on the grounds of maintaining a level playing field between the schools which for me was the real crux of the issue anyways not the age limit, should have been restrict from compet in the triwizard tournament disclaim

favorite overall. However, that hasn't shut my eyes to what is arguably one of the biggest plot contrivances of the entire series: Harry mysteriously getting his name put into the Goblet and then having to compete in the Triwizard Tournament regardless of whether he wanted to or not (despite being under the established age-limit), all so he can ""win"" the tournament and get whisked off to Voldemort by a portkey trophy. Indeed! Now, I am fully aware of the fact that having your name come out of the Goblet is a ""binding magical contract."" Break the contract, something bad happens. That's fine, but let's look at this closer: **did Harry *really* have to compete?**  For starters, the definition of ""competing"" in the Triwizard Tournament is never made clear: Dumbledore warns the students that once you are in (i.e., your name is selected by the Goblet) you have to see the tournament through to the end, but that's about it. Now, on its face that looks like enough: Harry's name comes out of the Goblet and so he has to stick it out and compete just like Dumbledore said.

water”*  \- from the Predictions of Tycho Dodonus  My favorite character in the first Fantastic Beasts film was Queenie, who has a heartbreaking but understandable turnaround in this new film – what can I say? I like the conflicted characters best.   Which brings me to Yusuf Kama, also very conflicted. He was obsessed with Tycho’s predictions, and assumed they referred to his family and to himself. But do they? I’m also more interested in his Unbreakable Vow. If he was sworn to avenge his family on the “person who Corvus Lestrange loved best in the world” (Or something like that; if the wording on that’s off, please tell me what you remember!), has he achieved that? And if so, what happens to you and your Unbreakable Vow? If you can’t achieve it, you die. But it’s obvious that Yusuf isn’t dead, at least, not yet. Does an Unbreakable Vow have more to do with what you *believe* you have or haven’t done, or does it have to do with what you’ve *actually* done?  Yusuf assumes that the person Corvus Lestrange loved most was Leta’s little brother, also named Corvus Lestrange, who she abandoned to be accidentally killed. But if Yusuf is still alive, that means one of two things: either little Corvus is still alive, or little Corvus isn’t the one Corvus Lestrange Sr. loved best. It obviously wasn’t Lita that her father loved best, by her own and Yusuf’s admission, and when she died, Yusuf was still fine and dandy, too. So how does he resolve this Unbreakable Vow? What do you think?  There’s also the idea of whether Corvus and Lita may or may not be the ones referred to in Tycho’s predictions. Who do you think they refer to?"

Hope it's gay enough for you until the next one comes out which we would be lucky to see one kiss the other's hand. We will never see explicit homosexuality in the Wizarding World. JK knows how to write heterosexual couples but will never explicitly show homosexuality.

3032,abernathy's path theory spoiler hi there this is a small theory on abernathy s part in tcog and among grindelwald s followers in general and i hope you forgive me for drifting into aberbunty shipping by the end xd enjoy __________________________________________________________________________ the road by the beginning of tcog we learn that abernathy is actually a follower of grindelwald perhaps even was during the incidents of ny he helps him escape and can be seen getting the required skull for his visions with rosier and among the rest of his higher ranked henchmen but more than once doesn t look convinced of what he is doing even nervous frightened first of all i think grindelwald recruited him for a reason since he oversaw a department including the wand permit office and welcomed the european officials who would transfer grindelwald to the old world i d say he s the head of the macusa s department for international magical cooperation not only can grindelwald use someone with experience in this field but also bribe him with the promise of a high rank in his new world maybe even becoming new president of magic of the usa but not just that a golden trophy we saw in the first movie that he is infatuated with queenie so perhaps grindelwald promised him early on that he would in a way make this happen once the war was over i d say it would be in his own interest as well to have a legilimence among his followers and as we know there are ways to jinx someone into agreeing to a relationship this could even lead to a comical scene in fb3 in which queenie who most likely rejected his polite advances in the years leading up to rio actually quite surely confronts him about this plan and about who could live with a jinxed partner which earns her some eyebrows risen beyond the hairline from the rest of the group although she has an out she wasn t going to keep the spell up permanently anyway concerning her aka her being one of the reasons maybe even the greater one why he is a follower of grindelwald we can also go a little further we know he likes her type i d say a broad smile specific facial features a cheerful nature my theory is that he maybe even in the next movie either meets or is told to get in contact with newt s assistant bunty _______________________________________________________________________ the unexpected we don t know if his tounge is still split by the next movie which i wouldn t put past maybe grindelwald conditioned him so much that he wears it proudly as a sacrifice for his master but his muteness could be used to attempt draw her in using her compassion and the fact that she has no problem with silence having worked with animals and because of the beautiful large green eyes a feature he shares with her prior crush i m sure she ll notice them an so eventually something goes wrong he starts falling for her and she never having stepped from the loyalty to both newt and dumbledore helps him to switch sides and eventually asks newt to try and fix his tounge which he agrees to do only for her not having forgotten how abernathy scolded tina in  although he was only doing his job afterwards i think his and bunty s kids could become friends with the ones from the rest of the group but that is much further ahead anyway what do you think anything to add thank you very much for reading,abernathy' path

read,"Abernathy's path (theory) (spoiler) Hi there :)  This is a small theory on Abernathy’s part in TCOG and among Grindelwald’s followers in general - and I hope you forgive me for drifting into Aberbunty-shipping by the end XD Enjoy :)  __________________________________________________________________________   **The road**  By the beginning of TCOG, we learn that Abernathy is actually a follower of Grindelwald (perhaps even was during the incidents of NY). He helps him escape and can be seen getting the required skull for his visions with Rosier and among the rest of his higher-ranked henchmen, but more than once doesn’t look convinced of what he is doing … even nervous, frightened.  First of all, I think Grindelwald recruited him for a reason. Since he oversaw a department including the wand permit office and welcomed the european officials who would transfer Grindelwald to the old world, I’d say he’s the head of the MACUSA’s department for international magical cooperation.  Not only can Grindelwald use someone with experience in this field, but also bribe him with the promise of a high rank in his new world, maybe even becoming new president of magic of the USA… but not just that :)    **A golden trophy**  We saw in the first movie that he is infatuated with Queenie - so perhaps Grindelwald promised him early on that he would, in a way, make this happen once the war was over? I’d say it would be in his own interest as well to have a legilimence among his followers, and, as we know, there are ways to jinx someone into agreeing to a relationship.  This could even lead to a comical scene in FB3, in which Queenie (who most likely rejected his (polite) advances in the years leading up to Rio, actually quite surely) confronts him about this plan, and about who could live with a jinxed partner, which earns her some eyebrows risen beyond the hairline from the rest of the group (although she has an out, she wasn’t going to keep the spell up permanently).  Anyway, concerning her aka her being one of the reasons, maybe even the greater one why he is a follower of Grindelwald, we can also go a little further …  We know he likes her type - I’d say a broad smile, specific facial features, a cheerful nature … my theory is that he, maybe even in the next movie, either meets or is told to get in contact with Newt’s assistant Bunty.   _______________________________________________________________________   **The unexpected**  We don’t know if his tounge is still split by the next movie (which I wouldn’t put past, maybe Grindelwald conditioned him so much that he wears it proudly as a sacrifice for his master) but his muteness could be used to attempt draw her in using her compassion, and the fact that she has no problem with silence (having worked with animals) - and because of the beautiful large green eyes (a feature he shares with her prior crush) … I’m sure she’ll notice them :)  An so, eventually, something goes wrong - he starts falling for her and she, never having stepped from the loyalty to both Newt and Dumbledore, helps him to switch sides and eventually asks Newt to try and fix his tounge (which he agrees to do only for her, not having forgotten how Abernathy scolded Tina in 1926 (although he was only doing his job)).  Afterwards, I think his and Bunty’s kids could become friends with the ones from the rest of the group - but that is much further ahead :)  Anyway, what do you think? Anything to add?  Thank you very much for reading :)"

I’m not a religious person at all.  If you pressed me on it I’d probably call myself an atheist.  But I realized recently that I read Harry Potter the way some people read the Bible: a little bit almost every day, as a source of comfort and guidance, and to help myself understand myself and other people better.  I also find a lot of my guiding principles in there.  Courage, standing up for what’s right, friendship, love, acceptance (myself and others) and the need, to a fault, to see the best in people.  I’ve had some of those values my whole life, but some were definitely instilled by HP.  Before we get all L Ron Hubbard about it, I’m not saying I believe it’s real, I obviously don’t (except in that “it’s real to us” way).  I also obviously wouldn’t *actually* call it my religion, because I can alienate people perfectly well already without adding on a made-up religion on top of my already weirdass personality, thank you very much.  But it seems like it does for me what actual religion does for a lot of people, except instead of Jesus and church it’s an imaginary wizard named Albus Dumbledore a bunch of weirdos on the Internet (in the best way).  Anyone else or am I way off the deep end here?"

(Prisoner of Azkaban spoilers) So, I’m sure everyone else already knew this lol. Just felt like sharing because I never had put it together before.   In the scene near the end when Dumbledore is giving Hermione instructions to save Sirius, he already knows that they succeeded.  Since the timeline isn’t altered through time travel and Harry and Hermione “in the past” had always affected the present, Dumbledore would have just seen Buckbeak disappear from Hagrid’s hut and knowing about Hermione’s time turner likely had pieced together that she was responsibility. Hence the line, “if you succeed more than one innocent life may be spared.” He already knew that Buckbeak had been spared.   Like I said, I’m sure everyone else realized this but still wanted to share lol. I had always understood that he knew about Hermione’s time turner but it wasn’t until my rewatch yesterday when I realized he already knew Buckbeak was alive when he was saying all that.   PoA was always my favorite movie. I actually really like how they handle time travel in this universe."

However, in an early draft, it was Zabini who Ginny was dating and acted as a romantic rival and antagonist to Harry. J.K.

But I think he missed a real opportunity here.  & #   The first book shows that interactions with snakes don't have to be all creepy with that adorable interaction with the python. Heck, the snake created by Malfoy actually listens to Harry in the second book. So obviously normal snakes aren't inherently evil. So why the heck doesn't Harry befriend all the snakes around school to help him with shenanigans? You can't control it, might as well normalize it and have fun.   & #   Think of it! Passing notes in class with a li'l snake buddy, the short-range animal messenger! Break a quill in an exam? No worries, there's a snake on hand to fetch you a new one! Ask them to spell out curse words then disperse when Percy tries to tattle on you! Teach them tricks at breakfast! Have them spell out ""SLYTHERIN SUCKS"" because oh my God that would be hilarious to have their own mascot turn on them. Dreading asking out your Yule Ball date? Make an ice-breaker prom-posal style with snakes asking your date so you don't have to! Put little hats on them! Dress them up! Give them names!  I'm imagining a little garden snake with a suit and top hat gliding along the castle floor and some random kids are like ""Oh there goes Lord Snekington about his Sunday business.""   & #   I can't think of a better way to prove you're not the Heir of Slytherin than using your power in a completely inane way. Plus, Hagrid would totally approve of li'l snek buddies."

Do you think he might die in one of the later sequels? Or, even worse, he might betray the Ministry and join Grindelwald. THAT would certainty explain his omission in the biography section of Newt's future book, if he betrayed Newt, and hurt him so badly Newt couldn't bear to write his name, similar to how Dumbledore never brought up his OWN family in conversation. It was still too sore a spot. But anyway these are just theories. What you think?"

3138,i just watched cog i finally made myself time to watch cog i loved it loved seeing newt again loved the new creatures loved seeing the different ministry of magic around the world loved seeing new tricks loved dumbledore and loved grindelwald that being said i don't think the movie is perfect the story did seem a little all over the place not because of the content but because the events from scene to scene felt rushed instead if natural decisions made by the characters again it doesn't mean i didn't like said events i disliked the transitions between them sometimes it felt like the subplots overlapped without real connection it made me wish jk would write the books and let someone else write the scripts that and the music would be my only big complains i wish they would've made a more iconical soundtrack it felt generic surprisingly though two of the most solid parts of the movie were every dumbledore and grindelwald's scenes before watching cog i was a bit worried because  all the criticism johnny depp has had lately  i wasn't sure jude law could portray dumbledore for multiple reasons at the end their scenes were the ones that immersed me in the story the most since i tried to stay away from spoilers the blood vow took me by surprise that was a great little twist it was a bit un epic how newt got the thing why would grindelwald have the vial in such an easy place for someone to steal i also loved pretty much every scene with newt in it interestingly enough he wasn't really the hero of the movie nor the main protagonist by the end of it that disappointed me a little i was expecting a great character development for him but in general he only confessed to and chose a side quite forcefully finally what got my attention was the credence subplot he's more powerful than i imagined but i still can't see a real threat from him he doesn't feel convinced enough yet same as i don't really see newt convinced enough to be a hero for any violent cause yet i still think he would look for another way to fight other than violence but you know epic magic movie there has to be a big fight between heroes and villains at some point i will have to let it sink a few more hours and then look into the details i'm sure i missed in other words theory time,i just watch cog i final made myself time to watch cog i love it love see newt again love the new creatur

I loved it! Loved seeing Newt again, loved the new creatures, loved seeing the different Ministry of Magic around the world, loved seeing new tricks, loved Dumbledore and loved Grindelwald.  That being said, I don't think the movie is perfect. The story *did* seem a little all over the place, not because of the content but because the events from scene to scene felt rushed instead if natural decisions made by the characters. Again, it doesn't mean I didn't like said events, I disliked the transitions between them. Sometimes it felt like the subplots overlapped without real connection. It made me wish JK would write the books and let someone else write the scripts.  That, and the music, would be my only big complains. I wish they would've made a more iconical soundtrack... It felt generic.  Surprisingly though, two of the most solid parts of the movie were every Dumbledore and Grindelwald's scenes. Before watching CoG I was a bit worried because 1) all the criticism Johnny Depp has had lately, 2) I wasn't sure Jude Law could portray Dumbledore for multiple reasons. **At the end**, their scenes were the ones that immersed me in the story the most.   Since I tried to stay away from spoilers, the blood vow took me by surprise. That was a great little twist. It was a bit ""un-epic"" how Newt got the thing. Why would Grindelwald have the vial in such an easy place for someone to steal?  I also *loved* pretty much every scene with Newt in it. Interestingly enough, he wasn't really the hero of the movie nor the main protagonist by the end of it. That disappointed me a little, I was expecting a great character development for him but, in general, he only confessed to and *""chose a side""* quite forcefully.  Finally, what got my attention was the Credence subplot. He's more powerful than I imagined but I still can't see a real threat from him. He doesn't feel convinced enough yet. Same as I don't really see Newt convinced enough to be a hero for any violent cause yet. I still think he would look for another way to fight other than violence. But... you know... Epic magic movie, there has to be a big fight between heroes and villains at some point.  I will have to let it sink a few more hours and then look into the details I'm sure I missed. In other words... *theory time*!"

Credence Theory. Credence Barebone is actually a Grindelwald?  At the end of Crimes of Grindelwald, Gellert tells Credence two things,  1. His real name is Aurelius Dumbledore  2. His brother is moving against him  There are many theories around this. A couple of them are,   1. Gellert is telling the truth and Credence is really Aurelis Dumbledore.  2. Gellert is lying to try and manipulate Credence/Aurelis #Credelius into going after Albus because Gellert can't due to the bloodpact.  The 2nd is very possible but what about the first?  Percival Dumbledore (Albus's father) was sent to Azkaban for life before Albus started at Hogwarts and supposedly died shortly after.  His mother, Kendra, died shortly after Albus graduated from Hogwarts.  So unless Percival somehow escaped from Azkaban after Ariana died then and started another family and had a son then there is no way Credelius is Albus's brother let alone a Dumbledore...  Which brings me to my theory.  I believe Gellert was only half lying to Credence, telling him that he is Arelius Dumbledore is a lie to get him to specifically target Dumbledore, but the part about his ""Brother moving against him"" is true and he planted the Phoenix chick for Credence to find to back up his lie.  In Crimes of Grindelwald we know that Albus and Gellert can't attack one another due to the bloodpact they made between them so Gellert needs to find another powerful wizard he can use to defeat Dumbledore.  We know that Credence is very powerful and is even more so thanks to being a Obscurus.  We also see at the end of CoG that Gellert gives Credence a wand, and what are the chances of him just having a wand that will work for Credence?  I theorize that Credence Barebone is actually Credence Grindelwald and the reason why the wand works so well for Credence is because, much like how Ron Weasley was using his older brothers wand in the first two Harry Potter books, Credence is using the wand of his elder brother, Gellert Grindelwald."

1266,was barty crouch junior's character added at the last second mostly everyone talks about how scarily accurate crouch jr portrayed the real moody and how it's strange that every character basically accepts the actual moody including  after spending the entire year with an impostor now if you were to ask me to guess who put  name in the goblet before it is revealed i would never had guessed that the boy who was practically begging his father to hear him out that he was innocent in the longbottoms tortures to have been the culprit and i'm assuming that no other  fan would have guessed this as well unless you were one of the few who did guess correctly if you did then please tell how you guessed right it is known that the gof had to be rewritten halfway through the process thanks to a plothole that rowling found now we don't have much information on what the plothole was all we can go by is what rowling has said herself in an interview back when gof was first released gt the first three books my plan never failed me but i should have put that plot under a microscope i wrote what i thought was half the book and ack huge gaping hole in the middle of the plot i missed my deadline by two months in the same interview she mentions that the plothole had to do with pulling a weasley cousin from a story who basically had the same function as rita skeeter now this seems to solve the plothole problem except for the whole moody plot twist the thing is once finding out that moody was an impostor the entire time it does seem to be thrown in last minute once you get to think about it especially since only a few key lines could possibly give crouch jr 's position away such as if there's anything i hate more it's a death eater who walked away free and the fact that crouch jr in the pensieve is drastically different from the one that is revealed in the end of the book he basically turns from being an innocent boy begging his release to relishing in the fact that he had helped bring voldemort back to form which leads me to believe that crouch jr wasn't an originally planned character or had been only limited to the pensieve scene before getting promoted to top bad guy the pensieve scene and the moment where sirius black mentions crouch senior threw his own son in azkaban could have easily been written to show just how ruthless senior is and show how not all people who fight against death eaters are saints where does moody come into all of this as for moody i'm led to believe that either he was supposed to be himself the entire time or the pettigrew was to be the original impostor why pettigrew because he was already introduced the last book and had escaped back to voldemort it wouldn't have been hard to believe that he could pull this off after tricking everyone into thinking sirius had betrayed the  for  years the problem that arises from this though is the marauder's map once  takes a peek at it he would see pettigrew instead of snape in the potion store and boom caught red handed that is why crouch jr was created or promoted to bad guy if crouch jr had been originally created for the pensieve scene then he could've had another name all rowling would have to do is change his o g name to barty and since the map doesn't distinguish titles such as junior senior etc it made an easy route for  to mistake the culprit as senior in the potions store and then maybe the big rewrite comes into chapter  the dark mark this is the the basic meat of the entire crouch storyline this is where the the hints and pieces can be picked up that something is off about senior and winky from winky struggling to run as though something was holding her back to senior looking gaunt and pale after coming back from the forest having just as we know discovered junior underneath the invisibility cloak on the ground not to mention the question as to who sent the dark mark up to begin with what about crouch jr 's character afterwards i know that some people wonder why the crouches are rarely ever mentioned again in later books especially since percy talked highly of senior during gof not to mention sirius's story of him now senior can be excused because you know he's dead but what about junior the main catalyst for returning voldemort back to his body he received the dementor's kiss not only because he was too powerful breaking free of the imperius curse and plotting the entire tournament but he was nothing more than a means to fill out the greater plot of the story therefore he was no longer needed when bellatrix filled his role

Mostly everyone talks about how scarily accurate Crouch Jr. portrayed the real Moody, and how it's strange that every character basically accepts the actual Moody, including Harry, after spending the entire year with an impostor. Now, if you were to ask me to guess who put Harry's name in the Goblet before it is revealed, I would never had guessed that the boy who was practically begging his father to hear him out, that he was innocent in the Longbottoms tortures, to have been the culprit. And I'm assuming that no other Potter fan would have guessed this as well (unless you were one of the few who did guess correctly. If you did, then please tell how you guessed right).  It is known that the GOF had to be rewritten halfway through the process, thanks to a plothole that Rowling found. Now we don't have much information on what the plothole was. All we can go by is what Rowling has said herself in an interview back when GOF was first released:  &gt;The first three books, my plan never failed me. But I should have put that plot under a microscope. I wrote what I thought was half the book, and ”Ack!” Huge gaping hole in the middle of the plot. I missed my deadline by two months.  In the same interview she mentions that the plothole had to do with pulling a Weasley cousin from a story, who basically had the same function as Rita Skeeter. Now this seems to solve the plothole problem, except for the whole Moody plot twist.   The thing is, once finding out that Moody was an impostor the entire time, it does seem to be thrown in last minute once you get to think about it, especially since only a few key lines could possibly give Crouch Jr.'s position away, such as ""If there's anything I hate more, it's a Death Eater who walked away free."" And the fact that Crouch Jr. in the Pensieve is drastically different from the one that is revealed in the end of the book. He basically turns from being an innocent boy, begging his release, to relishing in the fact that he had helped bring Voldemort back to form.  Which leads me to believe that Crouch Jr. wasn't an originally planned character, or had been only limited to the Pensieve scene before getting promoted to top bad guy. The Pensieve scene and the moment where Sirius Black mentions Crouch Senior threw his own son in Azkaban, could have easily been written to show just how ruthless Senior is, and show how not all people who fight against Death Eaters are saints.  **Where does Moody come into all of this?**  As for Moody, I'm led to believe that either he was supposed to be himself the entire time, or the Pettigrew was to be the original impostor. Why Pettigrew? Because he was already introduced the last book and had escaped back to Voldemort. It wouldn't have been hard to believe that he could pull this off after tricking everyone into thinking Sirius had betrayed the Potters for 12 years.   The problem that arises from this, though, is the Marauder's Map. Once Harry takes a peek at it, he would see Pettigrew instead of Snape in the Potion Store, and boom! Caught red-handed. That is why Crouch Jr. was created, or promoted to bad guy.  If Crouch Jr. had been originally created for the Pensieve scene, then he could've had another name. All Rowling would have to do is change his O.G. name to Barty, and since the Map doesn't distinguish titles such as Junior, Senior, etc., it made an easy route for Harry to mistake the culprit as Senior in the Potions Store.  And then, maybe the big rewrite comes into Chapter 9, The Dark Mark. This is the the basic meat of the entire Crouch storyline. This is where the the hints and pieces can be picked up that something is off about Senior and Winky, from Winky ""struggling to run, as though something was holding her back,"" to Senior looking gaunt and pale after coming back from the forest, having just, as we know, discovered Junior underneath the invisibility cloak on the ground. Not to mention the question as to who sent the Dark Mark up to begin with.  **What about Crouch Jr.'s character afterwards?**  I know that some people wonder why the Crouches are rarely ever mentioned again in later books, especially since Percy talked highly of Senior during GOF not to mention Sirius's story of him.  Now, Senior can be excused, because you know, he's dead. But what about Junior? The main catalyst for returning Voldemort back to his body?   He received the Dementor's Kiss not only because he was too powerful breaking free of the Imperius Curse, and plotting the entire Tournament, but he was nothing more than a means to fill out the greater plot of the story. Therefore, he was no longer needed when Bellatrix filled his role in the later books."

I’m listening to the third Harry Potter book again, and almost every time I read/listen I wonder this, but never asked. Lupin uses a boggart in the lessons where he is trying to teach Harry the Patronus charm because it is the closest thing to an actual dementor. In the lessons, the boggart dementor produces the same effects on Harry as the real ones (causing him to hear his parents murder and make him pass out). Which, to me, begs the question, to what degree is it actually a dementor? Or, in the case of Neville’s where it turns into Snape, is it actually human/Snape? If it was a werewolf, would a bite have the same result as a true werewolf bite? (My hypothesis on the last question is that it would be like when Bill is bit by Greyback when it wasn’t the full moon). Anyone else’s thoughts/opinions?"

3594,the life and truths of gellert grindelwald timeline and proofs about his allegations a lot of people is taking for granted that grindelwald lied to credence about his identity here i am trying to make my point grindelwald didn't lie credence is aurelius albus brother i've already made a post where i theorized aurelius could be percival son conceived after the latter escaped azkaban have a look if you like to https //www reddit  _theory _some _truth _about _a _character _whom/ https //www reddit  some discussions later i have upgraded my theory clarifying some grey areas and coming up with what i think will be revealed in the upcoming movies here it is gellert grindelwald used percival dumledore to conceive aurelius wanting to create a new powerful obscurial wich he witnessed in ariana but couldn't harness due to her dying in the three way duel here's how it went down with dates and everything prior  gellert becomes fascinated with the deathly hallows he is expelled from durmstrang for having made twisted experiments so twisted that even a school pretty tolerant of dark arts doesn't approve he starts thinking about overturning the internation statue of secrecy  june gellert arrives in godric hollows to research the hallows befriends the orphan albus and discovers ariana a powerful obscurial who managed to live past the usual life expectancy of her kin he immediately starts planning how to harness her powers to aid his cause useless without the host fb1  july gellert and albus study the deathly hallows the make a blood pact not to fight each other probably gellert persuaded albus in doing so worried that the latter would later reject the cause and hunt him down  late august gellert tries to convince albus to study and use ariana's obscurus albus isn't sure aberforth discovers gellert plans and confronts him a duel ensue albus can't fight gellert and tries to protect both his brother and friend ariana gets involved in the duel due to her witnessing it and gets killed nobody knows who cast the spell that killed her the dumbledores lose a sister gellert looses an important and rare asset that he really treasured  september gellert visits gregorovitch and steals the elder wand  october  grindelwald having lost ariana does the only thing he can to try and get a new powerful obscurus he breaks into azkaban and either aid percival dumbledore escape or takes from him what he needs to generate a new obscurus he later either imperius him to conceived another son with an unknown woman or just use his semen to impregnate her so twisted experiments  july  anyone aurelius dumbledore is born  aurelius mother ends up loving his son and wants to protect him from grindelwald she ran away with her child planning to hide in usa if percival got out of azkaban he may have aided her and paid with his life  grindelwald looses aurelius and his mother they are aboard a ship to usa that sink aurelius mother dies trying to save his child unbeknown to her his child was swapped with baby corvus lestrange by leta aged  leta was bound to be the cause of his brother death via the prediction of tycho dodonus it is quite safe to say grindelwald investigated the matter and also presumed aurelius to be dead  aurelius dumbledore gets adopted by marylou barebone under the name of credence barebone credence was a false identity originally conceived to hide corvus lestrange credence is stated to be born in  in the certificate but this date doesn't add up even if credence is corvus this is an open issue if someone has some explanation i would be eternally grateful  grindelwald hears some rumors about a possible obscurus in new york he knows aurelius is dead he goes to find the obscurial and try to do what he couldn't with ariana he completely overlooks credence because he knows aurelius died and maybe because credence little sister reminds him so much of ariana  after witnessing credence powers grindelwald begins to suspect his true identity and later confirms it by using is magical hookah and/or ordering his followers to investigate on the matter sometime between  and  aurelius is tending to a bird chick that probably appeared in front of him out of nowhere in a burst of flames it is fawkes the phoenix guardian of the dumbledores passed down from father to son an unbeatable evidence of credence true lineage find me a hole in this i challenge you it's amazing how it all fell togheter almost by itself when i looked at dates and facts some criticism you might want to bring out no one ever escaped azkaban before sirius black gt gt that is prooven wrong in canon remember barty crouch jr lt kendra/ariana is aurelius mother gt gt we see two children in the ship both seemingly less then  old even if the ship sunk jan   aurelius would have been born in early  and we know that ariana and kendra were dead by that time lt credence has ariana obscurus inside him gt gt please show me some theory to support that that isn't i don't want to believe aurelius is albus brother my theory is far more logical and has to do just with character motivations no magical technicality here lt so all this happend by chance what a coincidence leta swapped his brother for aurelius gt gt what a coincidence both  and neville were born in late july by families who had three times defied voldemort i could go on with coincidences in original saga the we know and love lt why nobody mentioned aurelius in the original saga gt gt people have their reason to keep secrets and the dumbledores surely have history in keeping secrets i'm confident in the next movies we will see how events will go down and we will be given a valid reason on why albus never mentioned fighting or saving his brother aurelius that is required for jk or else she'll face the rage of the fandom remember that albus never told about snape to   would have never knew if not for snape himself imagine if rowling dropped the bomb of snape loving lily years after the last

i'm wait for your opinion make my day,"The Life and Truths of Gellert Grindelwald - Timeline and proofs about his allegations A lot of people is taking for granted that Grindelwald lied to Credence about his identity, here I am trying to make my point: Grindelwald didn't lie, Credence is Aurelius, Albus brother.   I've already made a post where I theorized Aurelius could be Percival son, conceived after the latter escaped Azkaban. Have a look if you like to:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xe7et/spoilers\_theory\_some\_truth\_about\_a\_character\_whom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/9xe7et/spoilers_theory_some_truth_about_a_character_whom/)  Some discussions later, I have upgraded my theory, clarifying some grey areas, and coming up with what I think will be revealed in the upcoming movies. Here it is:  * **Gellert Grindelwald used Percival Dumledore to conceive Aurelius, wanting to create a new powerful obscurial, wich he witnessed in Ariana, but couldn't harness due to her dying in the three way duel.**  Here's how it went down. With dates and everything:  * prior 1899 - Gellert becomes fascinated with the Deathly Hallows. He is expelled from Durmstrang for having made ""twisted experiments"", so twisted that even a school pretty tolerant of Dark Arts doesn't approve. He starts thinking about overturning the Internation Statue of Secrecy. * 1899 (June) - Gellert arrives in Godric Hollows to research the Hallows, befriends the orphan Albus, and discovers Ariana, a powerful obscurial who managed to live past the usual life expectancy of her kin. He immediately starts planning how to harness her powers to aid his cause (""useless without the host"" - FB1). * 1899 (July) - Gellert and Albus study the Deathly Hallows. The make a Blood Pact not to fight each other (probably Gellert persuaded Albus in doing so, worried that the latter would later reject the cause and hunt him down). * 1899 (Late August) - Gellert tries to convince Albus to study and use Ariana's Obscurus. Albus isn't sure. Aberforth discovers Gellert plans and confronts him: a duel ensue. Albus can't fight Gellert, and tries to protect both his brother and friend. Ariana gets involved in the duel (due to her witnessing it) and gets killed (nobody knows who cast the spell that killed her). The Dumbledores lose a sister, Gellert looses an important and rare asset that he really treasured. * 1899 (September?) - Gellert visits Gregorovitch and steals the Elder Wand. * 1899 (October 31?) - Grindelwald, having lost Ariana, does the only thing he can to try and get a new powerful Obscurus: he breaks into Azkaban and either aid Percival Dumbledore escape or takes from him what he needs to generate a new Obscurus. He later either imperius him to conceived another son with an unknown woman, or just use his semen to impregnate her (so ""twisted"" experiments). * 1900 (July 31, anyone?) - Aurelius Dumbledore is born. * 1901 - Aurelius mother ends up loving his son, and wants to protect him from Grindelwald. She ran away with her child, planning to hide in USA. If Percival got out of Azkaban he may have aided her, and paid with his life. * 1901 - Grindelwald looses Aurelius and his mother. They are aboard a ship to USA that sink. Aurelius mother dies trying to save his child. Unbeknown to her, his child was swapped with baby Corvus Lestrange by Leta (aged 5/6). Leta was bound to be the cause of his brother death via The Prediction of Tycho Dodonus. It is quite safe to say Grindelwald investigated the matter and also presumed Aurelius to be dead. * 1905 - Aurelius Dumbledore gets adopted by MaryLou Barebone under the name of Credence Barebone. Credence was a false identity originally conceived to hide Corvus Lestrange. (Credence is stated to be born in 1904 in the certificate, but this date doesn't add up, even if Credence is Corvus. This is an open issue, if someone has some explanation, I would be eternally grateful). * 1926 - Grindelwald hears some rumors about a possible Obscurus in New York. He knows Aurelius is dead, he goes to find the obscurial and try to do what he couldn't with Ariana. He completely overlooks Credence, because he knows Aurelius died, and maybe because Credence little sister reminds him so much of Ariana. * 1926 - After witnessing Credence powers, Grindelwald begins to suspect his true identity, and later confirms it by using is magical hookah and/or ordering his followers to investigate on the matter. * Sometime between 1926 and 1927 - Aurelius is tending to a bird chick (that probably appeared in front of him out of nowhere in a burst of flames). It is Fawkes, the Phoenix Guardian of the Dumbledores, passed down from father to son: an unbeatable evidence of Credence true lineage.  Find me a hole in this, I challenge you! It's amazing how it all fell togheter almost by itself when I looked at dates and facts.  Some criticism you might want to bring out:  * No one ever escaped Azkaban before Sirius Black! -&gt; &gt;!That is prooven wrong in canon, remember Barty Crouch Jr?!&lt; * Kendra/Ariana is Aurelius mother! -&gt; &gt;!We see two children in the ship, both seemingly less then 1yr old. Even if the ship sunk Jan-1-1901 Aurelius would have been born in early 1900, and we know that Ariana and Kendra were dead by that time.!&lt; * Credence has Ariana Obscurus inside him -&gt; &gt;!Please show me some theory to support that that isn't ""I don't want to believe Aurelius is Albus brother"". My theory is far more logical, and has to do just with character motivations, no magical technicality here!!&lt; * So all this happend by chance? What a coincidence Leta swapped his brother for Aurelius -&gt;&gt;! What a coincidence both Harry and Neville were born in late July, by families who had three times defied Voldemort: I could go on with coincidences in original saga the we know and love!!&lt; * Why nobody mentioned Aurelius in the original saga? -&gt;&gt;! People have their reason to keep secrets, and the Dumbledores surely have history in keeping secrets! I'm confident in the next movies: we will see how events will go down, and we will be given a valid reason on why Albus never mentioned fighting or saving his brother Aurelius. That is required for JK, or else she'll face the rage of the fandom. Remember that Albus never told about Snape to Harry. Harry would have never knew if not for Snape himself! Imagine if Rowling dropped the bomb of Snape loving Lily years after the last book: nobody would have believed her, but it would have still make sense with the canon.!&lt;  I'm waiting for your opinions... make my day!  & #   & #   & #   & #"

A Nundu Truthfully this just sort of popped into my head and I thought I'd drop it here, see what everybody's opinion is.  & #   Would a basilisk's gaze (you know, insta-death to anyone who looks it in the eye) do anything to a nundu, or would the nundu just ignore it and carry on its merry way? Basilisks are not known for being easy to kill, but a nundu, according to all the records/notes I've seen anywhere, are supposed to be even worse.  & #   Personally, I believe a nundu would likely just shrug the gaze off and continue murdering everything in sight. Seems like something it would do, and fits in with the whole '100 wizards vs giant disease leopard: leopard wins' thing nundus have going on. If 100 wizards is a stretch to kill/capture one, a nundu just ignoring a basilisk's gaze fits right in with the total lack of vulnerabilities they show. In addition, I rather doubt a venom/poison of any kind (basilisk included) would do anything to a nundu either, being the giant disease leopards they are.  & #   Thoughts? Opinions?

They had clothes that looked like it was from another generation but also kind of eccentric. I'm not saying everyone should  be in robes but their clothes should have some flare. Just look at Gilderoy Lockhart, Mad-eye Moody or Rita Skeeter!  A lot of the guys in COG looked like Peaky Blinders or just wore plane boring suits, I think that's why I couldn't see Jude Law as a young Dumbledore. He just looked like a guy and didn't really give off the vibe of the person we know he's going to become. It's a shame because simply putting some more effort into the wardrobes could have made such a big impact.  Now I think about it, all the Auror's in the first fantastic beasts all just wore matching leather trench coats and fedora's which was equally boring."

On mobile my apologies.  Based off what I read in the books it seems as though she considers Hagrid to be next in line to take the title. The reason I believe this is at the end of HBP she calls all heads of house to meet in her office and replaces Snape with Slughorn and also invites Hagrid. Although she never directly mentions the fact that he is to sit in her place as the new head of house it would only make sense as when Dumbledore took the office he replaced himself as head of Gryffindor with Mcgonagall.   What are your guys thoughts and opinions on this subject I couldn't find much discussion in regards to this online.

2050,discussion house elves are the product of an unbreakable vow this is going to be a long ride but stick with me me and a friend have been trying to pin down where exactly magic comes from it's easy in fictional worlds like the kingkiller chronicle https //www wikiwand com/en/the_kingkiller_chronicle and the old kingdom https //www wikiwand com/en/old_kingdom_ book_series where the magic's source is explicitly stated in wwohp magic is just sort of there so what do we know about magic it's probably not location based witches and wizards all over the world can cast spells regardless of their location and probably with the same amount of effort if not you'd definitely have some confused international students during goblet based on this we can assume that magic users aren't channelling magic from anywhere it's coming from within unless of course they're simply channelling it from the earth itself in which case does magic work in space magic doesn't really work without wands a magic user can't cast a spell without a wand for example and we know that wands have a sort of sentience to them the wand chooses the wizard after all so maybe they're the source of the magic definitely not we know that children can use a limited form of magic long before they have access to a wand take any of young tom riddle's exploits or an obscurial so even without a wand humans at least magical humans have some degree of control over magic when presented with a wand suddenly that human who up until now could only utilise a raw weak form of magic is able to control magic and make it bend to their will they spend seven years learning how to do so before being sent back into the world so what's the difference how come a wand can cause this change a wand is made of two components a wooden shell and a magical core if we assume the wood is mundane then it's the core that gives wands their magical properties and these cores are derived from magical creatures unicorn hair dragon heartstring phoenix feather amongst others they all have magical creatures in common so in order to control the flow of magic a magical human requires a tool made from a piece of a magical creature so what makes these creatures magical how do they get their magic at this point we have to throw away our magic comes from within theory because whatever we come up with here it has to apply to humans and creatures alike all animals must channel magical energy to some extent in humans this manifests as chaotic destructive power in unicorns this manifests as cursed blood in dragons fire breath presumably these animals must all be attuned to some sort of baseline magic somehow and here's how genetics if there's some cell back in the protozoic era that managed to evolve to tap into some universal magic energy hell why wouldn't that be evolutionarily selected for that gene gets passed down through the generations to all sorts of different creatures some species get it some don't yay for centaurs nay for horses magical creatures over time will evolve to be more magical to be better as a species at tapping into this energy and in humans and therefore probably all other species too some get the gene and some don't those that don't are called muggles they are mundane they can't tap into the magical background energy and that explains mudbloods and squibs too just because that gene is present doesn't mean it will always be expressed sometimes it'll hide in generations and only show itself once every few decades sometimes it won't show up at all even when both parents are pureblood so humans being the dominant species and having thumbs kill these magical animals to make tools that will allow them to channel their magic better yeah that seems to match human history pretty well but why do we need wands what if we could control magic without them and this is where house elves come in they're another magical creature they have access to a huge range of magic and it's literally right at their fingertips they're able to bypass spells that have been placed by wands and without any tool to constrain them do literally whatever they want but that's not the case is it because almost all house elves are bound to a human master they're slaves and are forced to act within a tiny box only pushing the boundaries of the last command they were given when a house elf does perform magic it's through sheer force of will https  fandom com/wiki/house elf_magic through intent they're not restricted to spells like wand users are and yet the magic they use is the same when dobby levitates a cake in the dursley household the trace picked that up as the hover charm which is a spell that wand users can use dobby was using the exact same piece of magic as a spell from this we can draw two assumptions  that spells are a way of selecting a very specific piece of magic which is then channelled using the wand by a wand user  that house elves have unrestricted access to all of magic based on this it may be the case that humans even magical ones are very weak magical creatures who need magically supplementing in order to be magically useful house elves however are extremely powerful so why not use part of a house elf as a wand core it makes sense right unicorns dragons and phoenixes are all well and good but they're not as insanely powerful as an elf why not elf heartstring surely that would make for a far more powerful wand core ethics aside a dark wizard who's truly dedicated to power would try this at some point the question is why hasn't anyone is it because they simply think it's abhorrent perhaps because house elves just don't make very good wands or maybe it's because they literally can't here's my proposal humans are evil they're nasty lying manipulative pieces of work who'll stop at nothing to be more powerful elves are good they're helpful and hardworking and each of them just wants the best they don't mind being used they just want to be productive they're cut out to be the planet's dominant species they're the ones who'll make leaps and bounds in technological and magical development and then everything fell apart when the humans invented wands suddenly the humans are a tangible threat they're armed and have access to magical power sure it's far weaker than elf magic but it's magic nonetheless and you can never underestimate the lengths a human will go to to get the upper hand and worse they want to put pieces of elves inside their wands so an elf thinks hang on a second no thank you and they go over to the humans and say now hold up there one second laddies i don't like the thought of you lot trampling all over my culture and my people in fact i won't allow it and the humans say ok buddy what are you gonna do about it and the elf thinks for a moment and says ok how about this you lot promise to not put any of my people in your wands ever for the rest of time and we'll give you something in return and the human says ok we'll never do that if you promise to make your whooole species a slave to our species forever and as they say that they look behind them laughing at their buddies knowing that there's no way this elf is gonna agree to that and the elf says yeah sure so long as there's a way for each elf to get out of the deal the human is shocked but agrees suggesting that the elf will be freed if their human master gives them clothes if nothing else then just for the humiliation of the thought of these elves never ever being able to wear clothes and the elf fearful for its live and that of its people agrees then they shake hands and the combination of human and elf magic sends ripples through time and space sealing this unbreakable vow not only for this specific couple but for both of their species forever leaving humans to become the dominant race uncontested and house elves as their slaves,discuss hous elv are the product of an unbreak vow thi is go to be a long ride but stick with me

with me.  -----  Me and a friend have been trying to pin down where, exactly, magic comes from. It's easy in fictional worlds like the [Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle) and the [Old Kingdom](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Old_Kingdom_(book_series\)), where the magic's source is explicitly stated. In WWOHP... magic is just sort of... there.  -----  So what do we know about magic?  It's probably not location-based. Witches and wizards all over the world can cast spells regardless of their location, and probably with the same amount of effort. If not, you'd definitely have some confused international students during Goblet. Based on this, we can assume that magic-users aren't channelling magic from anywhere - it's coming from within. (Unless, of course, they're simply channelling it from the earth itself, in which case - does magic work in space?)  Magic doesn't really work without wands. A magic-user can't cast a spell without a wand, for example. And we know that wands have a sort of sentience to them - the wand chooses the wizard, after all - so maybe they're the source of the magic?  Definitely not. We know that children can use a limited form of magic, long before they have access to a wand. Take any of young Tom Riddle's exploits, or an Obscurial. So, even without a wand, humans - at least magical humans - have some degree of control over magic.  When presented with a wand, suddenly, that human (who up until now could only utilise a raw, weak form of magic) is able to control magic and make it bend to their will. They spend seven years learning how to do so before being sent back into the world.  -----  So what's the difference? How come a wand can cause this change?  A wand is made of two components: a wooden shell, and a magical core. If we assume the wood is mundane, then it's the core that gives wands their magical properties. And these cores are derived from magical creatures - unicorn hair, dragon heartstring, phoenix feather, amongst others. They all have magical creatures in common.  So - in order to control the flow of magic, a magical human requires a tool made from a piece of a magical creature.  -----  So what makes these creatures magical? How do they get their magic?  At this point we have to throw away our ""magic comes from within"" theory, because whatever we come up with here, it has to apply to humans and creatures alike. All animals must channel magical energy to some extent. In humans this manifests as chaotic destructive power. In unicorns, this manifests as cursed blood. In dragons, fire breath, presumably.  These animals must all be attuned to some sort of baseline magic somehow. And here's how: genetics. If there's some cell back in the protozoic era that managed to evolve to tap into some universal magic energy, hell, why wouldn't that be evolutionarily selected for? That gene gets passed down through the generations to all sorts of different creatures. Some species get it, some don't. Yay for centaurs, nay for horses. Magical creatures, over time, will evolve to be more magical, to be better as a species at tapping into this energy. And in humans - and therefore probably all other species too - some get the gene and some don't. Those that don't are called Muggles. They are mundane. They can't tap into the magical background energy.  And that explains Mudbloods and Squibs, too. Just because that gene is present doesn't mean it will always be expressed. Sometimes it'll hide in generations and only show itself once every few decades. Sometimes it won't show up at all, even when both parents are pureblood.  So humans, being the dominant species and having thumbs, kill these magical animals to make tools that will allow them to channel their magic better. Yeah, that seems to match human history pretty well.  -----  But why do we need wands?  What if we could control magic without them?  And this is where house elves come in. They're another magical creature. They have access to a huge range of magic, and it's literally right at their fingertips. They're able to bypass spells that have been placed by wands and - without any tool to constrain them - do literally whatever they want.  But that's not the case, is it? Because almost all house elves are bound to a human master. They're slaves, and are forced to act within a tiny box, only pushing the boundaries of the last command they were given.  When a house elf does perform magic, it's through [sheer force of will](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/House-elf_magic), through intent. They're not restricted to spells like wand-users are.  And yet the magic they use is the same. When Dobby levitates a cake in the Dursley household, the Trace picked that up as the Hover Charm, which is a spell that wand-users can use. Dobby was using the exact same piece of magic as a spell.  From this we can draw two assumptions:  1. That spells are a way of selecting a very specific piece of magic, which is then channelled using the wand by a wand-user.  2. That house-elves have unrestricted access to all of magic.  Based on this, it may be the case that humans - even magical ones - are very weak magical creatures, who need magically supplementing in order to be magically useful. House elves, however, are extremely powerful.  -----  So... why not use part of a house elf as a wand core?  It makes sense, right? Unicorns, dragons and phoenixes are all well and good, but they're not as insanely powerful as an elf. Why not elf heartstring? Surely that would make for a far more powerful wand core?  Ethics aside - a dark wizard who's truly dedicated to power would try this at some point. The question is - why hasn't anyone?  Is it because they simply think it's abhorrent?  Perhaps because house elves just don't make very good wands?  Or maybe it's because... they literally can't?  -----  Here's my proposal:  Humans are evil. They're nasty, lying, manipulative pieces of work who'll stop at nothing to be more powerful.  Elves are good. They're helpful and hardworking, and each of them just wants the best. They don't mind being used, they just want to be productive. They're cut out to be the planet's dominant species. They're the ones who'll make leaps and bounds in technological and magical development.  And then everything fell apart when the humans invented wands.  Suddenly, the humans are a tangible threat. They're armed and have access to magical power. Sure, it's far weaker than elf magic, but it's magic nonetheless, and you can never underestimate the lengths a human will go to to get the upper hand. And worse - they want to put pieces of elves inside their wands.  So an elf thinks, ""hang on a second... no thank you!"" and they go over to the humans and say ""now hold up there one second laddies. I don't like the thought of you lot trampling all over my culture and my people. In fact, I won't allow it.""  And the humans say ""ok buddy. what are you gonna do about it?""  And the elf thinks for a moment and says, ""ok, how about this. you lot promise to not put any of my people in your wands. ever. for the rest of time. and we'll give you something in return.""  And the human says ""ok. we'll never do that, if you promise to make your whooole species a slave to our species, forever."" And as they say that, they look behind them, laughing at their buddies, knowing that there's no way this elf is gonna agree to that.  And the elf says ""yeah, sure. so long as there's a way for each elf to get out of the deal.""  The human is shocked, but agrees, suggesting that the elf will be freed if their human master gives them clothes (if nothing else then just for the humiliation of the thought of these elves never ever being able to wear clothes). And the elf, fearful for its live and that of its people, agrees.  Then they shake hands. And the combination of human and elf magic sends ripples through time and space, sealing this Unbreakable Vow not only for this specific couple but for both of their species. Forever.  Leaving humans to become the dominant race uncontested, and house elves as their slaves."

It really seems different enough so far to not feel like another Hogwarts.

Hogwarts Forever! and the Moving Stairs 14. The Face of Voldemort  So, you're probably wondering why I included 14 of the 19 on the soundtrack. It was hard to omit things in the first place! All the music in this movie is just so iconic. I thought that I had the right order, and then I would come across another one of my favourites! Agh! So difficult.  & #   **Chamber of Secrets**  1. Fawkes the Phoenix and Fawkes is Reborn 2. Gilderoy Lockhart 3. Reunion of Friends 4. Prologue: Book II and the Escape from the Dursleys 5. The Chamber of Secrets 6. The Flying Car 7. Polyjuice Potion 8. Meeting Aragog 9. The Spiders  A lot of the music here was recycled, John Williams was quite busy at the time. However, the newer additions are some of the best. Fawkes the Phoenix is majestic, beautiful. Probably one of the best pieces I've ever heard! Reunion of Friends, similar to Leaving Hogwarts, never fails to make me cry! Oh, and Gilderoy Lockhart is amusic and really fits the character.  & #   **Prisoner of Azkaban**  1. Buckbeak's Flight tied with Mischief Manage (the ending medley) 2. A Window to the Past 3. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight 4. Secrets of the Castle 5. Forward to Time Past 6. Hagrid the Professor 7. The Portrait Gallery 8. Aunt Marge's Waltz 9. The Knight Bus 10. The Werewolf Scene 11. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers 12. The Patronus Light  Yeah. A lot of the best music is on here. Buckbeak's Flight is one of the best John Williams ever composed, like wow. A Window to the Past is relaxing as heck, and the rest are so iconic. It's probably my favourite soundtrack of the lot.  & #   **Goblet of Fire**  1. Harry in Winter 2. Potter Waltz 3. Death of Cedric 4. Rita Skeeter 5. The Story Continues 6. Neville's Waltz 7. The Quidditch World Cup 8. The Black Lake 9. The Dark Mark 10. Sirius Fire 11. Hogwarts March 12. Foreign Visitors Arrive  The most underrated soundtrack of all time IMO. I didn't use to like it, I always thought it was pretty forgettable. That was, until, I gave it a relisten on its own. Wow, Harry in Winter is fantastic.  & #   **Order of the Phoenix**  1. Professor Umbridge and Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning 2. Ministry of Magic 3. Fireworks 4. Flight of the Order of the Phoenix 5. The Room of Requirements 6. Possession 7. Dumbledore's Army 8. Loved Ones and Leaving 9. Death of Sirius 10. A Journey to Hogwarts 11. Another Story  I just saw this in concert, and it sounded beautiful. The Ministry of Magic is just so creative, and Professor Umbridge is just so damn catchy!  & #   **Half-Blood Prince**  I do not have the soundtrack for this film :(  & #   **Deathly Hallows Part 1**  I do not have the soundtrack for this film :(  & #   **Deathly Hallows Part 2**  1. Courtyard Apocalypse and Statues 2. Lily's Theme 3. Voldemort's End 4. A New Beginning 5. Battlefield 6. Snape's Demise  My least favourite soundtrack, but I love Courtyard Apocalypse!  & #   **Top Ten of All Time**  1. Buckbeak's Flight 2. Fawkes the Phoenix 3. Leaving Hogwarts 4. Hedwig's Theme 5. Harry's Wondrous World 6. Harry in Winter 7. Courtyard Apocalypse 8. Professor Umbridge 9. Gilderoy Lockhart 10. Ministry of Magic"

There's no better place to start than reading about Jo herself, and so far it's been incredibly fascinating and engaging. Since 2001 I've read all the books, seen all the films multiple times and been in love with this ever-expanding world, and speaking of which, here's my aforementioned theory:  Jo spent time in Paris for a year of study, and Portugal as an interpreter in the early 90s...so perhaps, just maybe, Jo may take the opportunity of the Fantastic Beasts films to revisit some of the places she's been to, or even places she's always wanted to visit!  TLR: Jo's known travel history (the places she's been, or has expressed interest in) \*may\* give us clues as to where the third, fourth and fifth film will take place/visit.   Looking forward to your thoughts!"

Don't get me wrong, there is no one better on this planet than Maggie Smith for that role.  Richard Harris (71) was playing a 110 year old Dumbledore.  I know there is the one post in Pottermore saying she grew up in the early 1900's, but even if she was born in the 1890's she would still be growing up in the early 1900's. I was born in the 80's but grew up in the 90's."

2568,how was the defense against the dark arts job jinxed the famous theory that the defense against the dark arts job is cursed so that terrible things happen to it's teachers so they can't last except a year so voldemort can take the job this theory is almost confirmed and many characters including dumbledore hint at it you possibly know all of this already what you don't know is that it has a major plot hole it doesn't make since and no i'm not talking about the hogwarts enchantments i am talking about the jinxing part you can't jinx a job for you to jinx something it has to exist physically and a job doesn't exist physically so the correct theory is that he jinxed the office not the job because we can assume that the class never changes so voldemort jinxed the office of course you'll ask me then why aren't the students jinxed well the jinx he put may be a curse which works on a long period time that explains why moody died even though he didn't teach but he was locked inside the office for almost a year as for the hogwarts defenses part as we voldemort is talented in charms and we know curse creating exists as show by dolohov's purple flame curse so the reason it wasn't disabled by the hogwarts defenses is that it didn't exist so the castle isn't protected from it's effect and if you notice the better the teacher is the worse his fate is lockhart was a fraud and was hired only as a joke and he didn't teach the kids anything and he ended in st mungo and he got a longer part of the stick more than any other teacher umbridge got imprisoned god i wish we had a narration of that and she didn't teach anything except for theoretical knowledge next are moody lupin and quirell moody and lupin and possibly quirell were excellent teachers and gave very important

1796,the dark mark it's always been my head cannon that the dark mark apart from allowing death eaters to apparate to voldemort had to have some other powers one of the powers that i always thought it had was the ability to help voldemort easily track his death eaters which is why it was so easy for him to find karkaroff even though he was in an abandoned shack etc at one point i even theorized that once you were branded with it you were tied to voldemort forever if he truly died then anyone branded with the dark mark would die as well however i suppose that theory has been debunked since draco along with any other death eaters that didn't die in the battle of hogwarts didn't die when voldemort did i always thought that would have been a cool twist though,the dark mark it' alway been my head cannon that the dark mark apart from allow death eater to appar to voldemort had to have some other power one of the power that i alway thought it had wa the abil to help voldemort easili track hi death eater which is whi it wa so easi for him to find karkaroff even though he wa in an abandon shack etc at one point i even theoriz that onc you were brand with it you were tie to voldemort forev if he truli die then anyon brand with the dark mark would die as well howev i suppos that theori ha been debunk sinc draco along with ani other death eater that didn't die in the battl of hogwart didn't die when voldemort did i alway thought that would have been a cool twist though,the dark mark it' alway been my head cannon that the dark mark apart from allow death eater to appar to voldemort had to have some other power one of the power that i alway thought it had wa the abil to help voldemort easili track hi death eater which is whi it wa so easi for him to find karkaroff even though he wa in an abandon shack etc at one point i even theoriz that onc you were brand with it you were tie to voldemort forev if he truli die then anyon brand with the dark mark would die as well howev i suppos that theori ha been debunk sinc draco along with ani other death eater that didn't die in the battl of hogwart didn't die when voldemort did i alway thought that would have been a cool twist though,"The Dark Mark It's always been my head cannon that the Dark Mark, apart from allowing Death Eaters to apparate to Voldemort, had to have some other powers. One of the powers that I always thought it had was the ability to help Voldemort easily track his Death Eaters, which is why it was so easy for him to find Karkaroff even though he was in ""an abandoned shack"", etc.   & #   At one point I even theorized that once you were branded with it, you were ""tied"" to Voldemort forever. If he *truly* died, then anyone branded with the Dark Mark would die as well. However, I suppose that theory has been debunked since Draco (along with any other death eaters that didn't die in the Battle of Hogwarts) didn't die when Voldemort did. I always thought that would have been a cool twist, though."

In the first book, Hagrid tells Harry that you needed to be mad to rob Gringotts, the bank of wizards. As you know Gringotts is a highly secured bank (dragons, spells, enchantments and many more).   I have been thinking about creating a story or wanting to read a story about some wizards, escaping from the prison of Azkaban, trying to steal gold from the bank.   The story would show different uses of magic than depicted in Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It would show depth and another part of the wizarding world.   As for the timeline, I would not know when this heist would take place.  Thank you for reading and I hope it sounds somewhat interesting."

And how will she end up from standing with Newt and the others to serving Voldemort? My suggestion (very vague) : For time references, Voldemort is born (according to the Harry Potter Wiki) on the 31.12.1926, FB2 begins in 1927. I think that Nagini would be hanging around the area where Tom Riddle hangs around and 'plays' with the other kids (in snake form), he'll get attached more and more to Nagini and discover that he's a Parselmouth (because he can speak to Nagini) and slowly realise his abilities as a wizard, which is when the problems start with the other orphans.  What are your theories?"

What do you think who killed Ariana Dumbledore because its not clear?  My opinion is that Dumbledore did it. It‘s a bit sad but let me explain why. He was a very powerful wizard and taught DADA. He later changed to transfiguration. It‘s not clear why he did but maybe it is because he accidentally killed Ariana and never wanted to ever make curses. Also Aberforth said Dumbledore had sacrificed a lot for his rise of power.     I really like Dumbledore but I just wanted to share my thoughts with you

By ensuring Harry would be a tri wizard champion he put him through trials he would have never gone through normally. This in part gives Harry the confidence to start the DA. It is also true that even though he was setting Harry up, Barty Crouch JR ended up teaching Harry far more than any other DADA teacher apart from of course Lupin."

That movie was so over complicated and confusing. I loved the magic, cinematography and characters. Even the acting was solid but the plot was burdened by so DAMN much. They needed to cut some out and spend that additional time explaining the plot and character motivations. I hope Fantastic Beats doesn't become JK Rowling's Star Wars prequels. She is a great story teller and world builder but she needs experienced screenwriters and filmic storytellers to reshape her vision for the screen. I could easily see Crimes of Grindelwald being a 600 page JK Rowling novel that was crammed into two hours. I'm so pissed, I loved everything about it except the bloated and complicated plot. PLEASE JK and Warner Brothers, listen to the critics and fix this for the next film. (Also, don't have Queenie just come back to the good side again...she made her bed, make her sleep in it and build a character we love into a conflicted evil character to the end!)"

3492,spoilers saw crimes of grindenwald my review hi everyone i am a long time   universe fan read all the books and saw all the movies when i came out from the theater after  i was very pleased it had a lot of new stuff nicely fixed into existing universe moreover it expanded the lore on magical creatures which in my opinion were integral part of the world all along so it is consistently magical it was ok plotwise not complicated not stupid characters were sane believable but not in crimes of grindelwald ok first things first what were the crimes all we are shown is that he is most wanted revolutionary who wants to get wizards in control of muggles because they are dumb in short typical arch villain with dictatorship ambitions we had similar shit with voldemort but he was a magical nazi dude but with voldemort we were told that he killed lots of people had a private army of death eaters and killed  parent's for security reasons not with grindelwald what we are shown is that what he wants but not his motivation and that he and dumbledore were gay and loved each other that's all no crimes i also did not like neither johnny depp as grindelwald nor the character appearance at all i did not understood those boots what's up with those the dude is clearly not a goth and nobody around wears that stuff since you can warm and dry yourself with a wand white eye villain that was a cliche imo and johnny depp i like him but not in this movie this villain should've been charismatic revolutionary flaming human torch of progress not an overgrown edge lord with no facial mimic whatsoever gary oldman could've been a good choice for the role but he is too british for the german descent hero but he at least has living facial muscles queenie situation and motivation is just plain dumb queenie is a rare person who sees into other's minds clearly she sees true colors of each around her and falls in love with jacob because of that he is a great human being then with that much of insight of humans she naturally should be a very wise one too since she saw a lot of shit around her and must've learned on that and it was like that in previous movie but not in crimes here we see a semi hysterical damsel who is driven with need be wed even though she knows jacob's reasons of declining that and so on the even bewitches him with that love potion which is plainly crazy and then after their reunion at the end of the movie she joins grindelwald for no reason whatsoever the only reason i could think of is that jk rowling wanted a good character in overall team of baddies so somebody would be kind in edge lord's evil castle in next movies newt and tina situation is unnecessary it is a plot device to get newt to paris to do dumbledore's chores oh well this is dumbledore at his prime as manipulative as his lover believable i loved that jude law was chosen as dumbledore he's a great actor i don't think the dark side of everyone's beloved professor will be shown in the next movies but i can bet that jude will nail it creedence and nagini it is interesting who are creedence parents but it is more interesting how nagini eventually sides with wizard nazis i also don't thing creedence is that powerful everyone are led to believe since that final mountain artillery session is not something exceptional in wizarding world there are spells and trinkets for that leta lestrange is overall useless to the plot and can be harmlessly removed along with creedence being corvus and how leta is bad and bla bla bla honestly her school years flashback does not show her as bad you talk shit about me now you don't tall biatch i also dont think zoë kravitz did an outstanding job of the character as i saw every review state this she seemed very tired all the time no facial mimic only somber glanses from under the brows and edgy teen grade problems also since corvus and leta are dead who held the lestrange name onwards into belatrix lestrange missing chain conclusion jk rowling needs help with writing or has to be a consultant who sets the universe around not the heros and their characters the only bright thing for me in this

testral driven carriag chase,"(spoilers) Saw Crimes of Grindenwald, my review Hi everyone. I am a long time Harry Potter universe fan, read all the books and saw all the movies. When I came out from the theater after FantasticBeasts I was very pleased - it had a lot of new stuff, nicely fixed into existing universe. Moreover, it expanded the lore on magical creatures, which in my opinion were integral part of the world all along, so it is consistently ""magical"". It was OK plotwise, not complicated, not stupid, characters were sane, believable.  But not in Crimes of Grindelwald. Ok, first things first. What WERE the crimes? All we are shown is that he is most wanted revolutionary, who wants to get wizards in control of muggles, because they are dumb in short. Typical arch-villain with dictatorship ambitions, we had similar shit with Voldemort, but he was a magical nazi dude. But with Voldemort we were told that he killed lots of people, had a private army of death eaters and killed Harry's parent's for security reasons. Not with Grindelwald. What we are shown is that what he wants, but not his motivation. And that he and Dumbledore were gay and loved each other. That's all. No crimes.   I also did not like neither Johnny Depp as Grindelwald nor the character appearance at all. I did not understood those boots, what's up with those? The dude is clearly not a goth, and nobody around wears that stuff since you can warm and dry yourself with a wand. White eye-villain? That was a cliche imo. And Johnny Depp. I like him, but not in this movie. This villain should've been charismatic revolutionary, flaming human torch of ""progress"". Not an overgrown edge-lord, with no facial mimic whatsoever. Gary Oldman could've been a good choice for the role, but he is too british for the ""german"" descent hero. But he at least has living facial muscles.  Queenie situation and motivation is just plain dumb. Queenie is a rare person, who sees into other's minds clearly. She sees true colors of each around her, and falls in love with Jacob because of that, he is a great human being. Then, with that much of insight of humans, she naturally should be a very wise one too, since she saw A LOT of shit around her, and must've learned on that. And it was like that in previous movie.   But not in Crimes. Here we see a semi-hysterical damsel, who is driven with need be wed, even though she knows Jacob's reasons of declining that and so on. The even bewitches him with that love potion, which is plainly crazy, and then after their reunion at the end of the movie, she joins Grindelwald FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. The only reason I could think of is that JK Rowling wanted a ""good"" character in overall team of baddies, so somebody would be kind in edge-lord's evil castle in next movies.   Newt and Tina situation is unnecessary, it is a plot device to get Newt to Paris to do Dumbledore's chores. Oh well. This is Dumbledore at his prime, as manipulative as his lover. Believable.   I loved that Jude Law was chosen as Dumbledore, he's a great actor. I don't think the dark side of everyone's beloved professor will be shown in the next movies, but I can bet that Jude will nail it.  Creedence and Nagini. It is interesting who are Creedence parents, but it is more interesting how Nagini eventually sides with wizard nazis. I also don't thing Creedence is THAT powerful everyone are led to believe, since that final mountain artillery session is not something exceptional in wizarding world, there are spells and trinkets for that.  Leta Lestrange is overall useless to the plot and can be harmlessly removed, along with Creedence being Corvus, and how Leta is bad, and bla-bla-bla. Honestly, her school years flashback does not show her as bad. ""You talk shit about me? now you don't, tall biatch"". I also dont think Zoë Kravitz did an outstanding job of the character, as I saw every review state this. She seemed very tired ALL THE TIME. No facial mimic. Only somber glanses from under the brows and edgy, teen grade problems. Also, since Corvus and Leta are dead, who held the Lestrange name onwards into Belatrix Lestrange? Missing chain.  Conclusion: JK Rowling needs help with writing, or has to be a consultant who sets the universe around, not the heros and their characters. The only bright thing for me in this movie was chinese dragon-cat, who looked cool, had cool abilities and more or less sane sequences, that did not wither my eyes with flashes as intro testral-driven carriage chase."

I just want to say.... WHY IN MERLIN'S BEARD ARE REPLICA WANDS NOT THE CORRECT LENGTH????   I mean, usually the error is within 1 to 0.5 inches. Is it so hard to make a wand 0.5 inches shorter?   I just bought the elder wand. I remember the cannon length being just about 40 cms (15-16 inch) so i messure it... sure enough, 39.3 cm (15.55 in)   ""Yeesss, a correct wand length for once!"" I thought, then i looked the correct dimensions.... 15.0 inches... ie 38.5 cm!   Voldemorts' wand? Well, cannonically 13.5 inch (34.29 cm) noble collection replica? 36.5!!!    Dont get me started on London Studio's replicas! Harry's 11 inch (27.95 cm) is instead 34.8!!! An almost full 7 cms longer!!!      Why in the bloody hell???

Been reading posts on this sub lately and got to thinking.  How is it possible that nobody knew Mad-Eye Moody well enough to realize that someone had been impersonating him for over 10 months?  Sure, Polyjuice Potion makes you look and sound exactly like another person, but it doesn't magically tell you what they're like as a person.  And yet, nobody at Hogwarts knew him well enough to catch any mistakes that the impostor may have made.  Yes, I do know that Moody had been the magical version of a bounty hunter for decades, which probably made him one of the most paranoid people alive.  And the real guy had all sorts of magical stuff that'd warn him if anyone was coming after him for any reason.  But still.  Nobody knew him well enough to realize that he was acting weird for *10 months!*"

From the first action scene where Grindelwald is seen sparing lives during his escape, to each and every killing moments where Avada Kedavras are delivered by his followers without explicitly heard orders from their leader... to the very last action scene where people killed by the blue flames have been warned, aggressive or treacherous... I left the movie theater under the impression that Grindelwald wasn't guilty of any crime at all  (the more questionable are the self defense kills in the Père Lachaise cemetery). And I find this beautiful.  In this case, the Crimes of Grindelwald are those of his followers, and they are motivated by His rhetoric. It gives much more depth to the entire universe of J.K. Rowling, and I find this beautifully executed."

https //scifi stackexchange com/questions/129193/how did  know that the portkey was layered but it's rooted in the fact that the headmaster hired a close friend despite a consensus this person was unhinged and the friend wound up being a serial killer the headmaster didn't notice his old friend was actually someone completely different this is different than the close friend the headmaster hired two years ago who attacked students as a werewolf or the hire four years ago who attacked students in the murder dungeon why is that in a school again or the hire three years ago who attacked students and tried to wipe their memory same year the board of trustees voted to have the headmaster removed for incompetency in fact the ministry wouldn't be here at all even given all this if the

books with swears in them i can't imagine what they'd say if we were practicing torture methods in gym class  umbridge doesn't believe cedric was murdered or voldemort is back um should she the facts people died at a death game dumbledore brought back a game cancelled because of all the deaths dragon provoking was round two and someone died that isn't super duper unexpected  is traumatized and not making much sense after returning  is immediately assaulted by a teacher he starts babbling things like ' the person i fear most came back from the dead and all these important people in my life were death eaters oh no not the three death eaters sitting with you at the time those were the only three that didn't show and my dead parents were there too then the portkey brought me back to here for some reason ' okay keep in mind other students had been confudus'd or imperious'd already during the event the story is full of holes with an obvious alternate explanation the portkey thing is the smallest part that doesn't make sense https //scifi stackexchange com/questions/18122/why was the triwizard cup portkey in goblet of fire two way and you defeated voldemort again to escape the serial killer in the room has claimed responsibility for the death of the student which kind of fits dumbledore makes a terrible case he doesn't say ' this is kind of my fault ' or ' let's talk about this away from the traumatized children ' he says ' you have to get rid of all your prison guards right now ' hold up dumbledore for a smart guy that wasn't a brilliant thing to say you sort of sounds like a crank nobody else believes  maybe that's why not just the minister of magic and the major newspaper but the international wizemgemot too think dumbledore is crazy of course  claims all those people are bought and paid for but do have any independent reason to believe that about the international community it's not unheard of for famous people to become ranting conspiracy theorists in their old age and occam's razor agrees with dolores and almost everyone else in the wizarding world on this one if this makes dolores evil is like the whole wizarding world evil too  she has  write lines for detention in his own blood leading to permanent scars this is definitely icky but lets look at it in context this is a milder wizard detention than others we've seen the morally unimpeachable mcgonagall's detention pick for first year students out past curfew was going into the forbidden forest unaccompanied except by a fearful dog to hunt down a thing that was killing unicorns wait what everyone almost died to a monster unsurprisingly until a centaur saved them against its nature especially in comparison to what filch admits happened in living memory writing lines doesn't seem so bad gt it's just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by gt your wrists from the ceiling for a few days i've got the chains still gt in my office keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed filch  can't stay out of detention it's extra gross because of the blood component but that's mostly for ick factor the scars clearly aren't meant to be permanent other students have them wear right off but  keeps getting detention unjustly he stands up the very first day of class and shouts at the teacher that she's a liar he disrupts constantly he gets into fist fights and tries to start an army at school from umbridge's perspective she has a very distributed young student and giving him detention far lighter than mcgonagall assigned to mischievous freshman is about in line with what we've seen in universe  she tries to stop dumbledore's army umbridge gets a credible tip that a troublesome student is trying to checks notes start an army to overthrow her and the government what does she do requests that official school clubs register with the school something that almost every school in the world already does it's also a good way to allocate funding two birds one stone she doesn't go on the war path or interrogate anyone out the gate it's only when the students go ahead and secretly start revolution club anyways that she starts a low key investigation with the support of many of the existing students at the school you know the ones who want to learn from the book and not foster guerilla armies  she suspends the griffindore quidditch team nothing she has done has gotten through to  he's still on a downward spiral that spoiler leads to him getting his godfather killed and wrecking dumbeldore's office literally no adult is supporting this kid emotionally other members of the quidditch team the weasley twins are so well known for their misbehavior that it's a meme they wind up dropping out and ruining exams maybe this is what will get through to them that they need to behave can you imagine if half of the soccer team at your highschool was constantly in detention and violent telling the team they need to behave academically to maintain their sport sounds pretty reasonable to me what happens when dolores gets overruled the very first game the players get into fist fights yikes guess she was right btw what's mcgonagall's game here in going over umbridge's head mcgonagall believes there's a serial killer mounting a coup and this is the hill she dies on  she files for more power what other options did she have she was a government auditor brought in because students were routinely dying or getting maimed and she literally can't discipline students by checks notes kicking them off a sports team she's being blocked at the most basic levels of discipline  she audits the teachers firing good ol' hagrid and trelawney gt 'i just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old gt fraud hermione gt gt the fact that hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge gt within the school over the next few days but to  indignation gt hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it this is strong evidence in her favor if she was really just trying to set up  and dumbledore she would have immediately gone to fire mcgonagall and snape his two closest allies after all she had wide latitude in interpreting the audit results but she doesn't she passes mcgonagall with flying colors and she questions sanpe on his former ties to terrorism and evident lack of full trust from the headmaster both fair questions trelawney isn't even a real teacher she's just a pawn in some long term chess game that dumbledore is playing he laughs that he'd give her a raise after her third actual prediction the trio feels bad for hagrid but hermione had long said he was a terrible sometimes dangerous teacher with no qualifications who was hired because why again the trio didn't even want to take his class even as his close personal friend not to mention all the class he's been skipping or the several dangerous human eating monsters he's secretly brought to or near campus the school has had a lot of hiring problems recently most famously the serial killer masquerading as dumbledore's best friend these are the exact type of things a responsible auditor would scrutinize  she threatens  with an unforgivable curse and azkaban let's look at the scene a lot of waving her wand and dramatically flipping over fudge's picture not a lot of actual spellcasting if you think umbridge is evil then the will to do this fits with her style but even so it should seem extremely out of character she follows the book to the t she doesn't fire mcgonagall or snape even when legalistically she could because she's religiously bound by the law she concedes immediately when dumbledore hires a new divinitation professor and insists trelawny stays on campus even though it's all highly irregular she always diligently files for more power she doesn't stretch the power she already has bureaucracy is her favorite thing in the world can you really imagine her casting unforgivable curses not just in front of a ton of witnesses but the children of important and powerful ministry officials like malfoy sure they like her but that sounds like a rumor that'll spread and for what gain to save some time that doesn't need to be saved this seems like textbook every teacher or procedural cop show ever oh if you don't confess right this second we'll expel you/throw you in prison/tell your parents/whatever threatening emptily is very in character and it worked sort of actually doing it would be wildly un umbridgey and downright stupid  she insults the centaurs out of universe centaurs may be stand ins for any number of marginalized groups but in universe they don't really make great metaphors they brutally attack each other and school characters repeatedly we don't see them doing almost anything else she seems afraid of them immediately and they violently assault her leaving her catatonic in the hospital they were provoked surely but saying they were justified is a lot of latitude we see this with werewolves too out of universe we think of them as symbols of discrimination but in universe the only two werewolves we see are lupin and greyback the former a certified good guy attacks and almost kills his best friend and students because he loses control in his first book and the latter gleefully attacks and murders people constantly without projecting our out of universe biases i'm not sure we have enough information to say whether the metaphor really holds up  she sends the dementors after  but does she gt 'it means that i think they were ordered there ' said dumbledore gt 'i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of gt dementors to go strolling through little whinging ' barked fudge gt 'not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the gt ministry of magic these days ' right dumbledore thinks voldemort did it in fact this is the exact thing dumbledore warned fudge about at the end of the last book in the next book it's confirmed voldemort is controlling the dementors and in this book there's a prison break that highly suggests it how would umbridge have done this without a paper trail waltz up to the most guarded prison on earth and politely ask the guards more to the point why would she did she genuinely hate this kid she'd never met so much to take such a huge personal risk again it's wildly out of character everything we directly see her do is to the letter legal she loves laws so why'd she say she did it well it's in the same monologue as   challenges whether her threat is serious and she goes 'oh i'm super duper serious i even sent those dementors just like you thought i did ' right sure this seems like more evidence that  was empty threats even when umbridge is headmaster she doesn't expel  without cause even though she could without risk but she risks it all to kill him out the gate hmm  she participates in a court against non pure bloods not a great look but keep in mind she'd spoiler had a horcrux on for months at this point when ron had to carry the same horcrux on and off for a little while he straight up abandons his friends and the fate of the world and goes home to his brother ginny hung out with a diary horcrux and tried to murder half the school and a few chickens and a cat dumbledore got hoodwinked by a horcrux in like  seconds could be unrelated admittedly we don't damn those characters so let's give umbridge the same benefit  she uses veritaserum on students snape says gt now the use of this potion is controlled by very strict ministry gt guidelines and she seems like the exact person in place to file for that kind of approval what do characters outside the trio think percy praises her fudge has promoted her to undersecretary and importantly scrimgeour keeps her onboard too we can nitpick the first two but scrimgeour is a pretty ethical dude he dies under torture to keep  safe madam bones seems to work closely with her and everyone loves bones the people who have worked with her all give her the marks of a practical and diligent public servant conclusion through the eyes of a teenager umbridge is the ultimate evil just like we all thought our least favorite teacher was in high school but with higher stakes i think this is a good thing umbridge is written well as a character with enough internal justification for her actions that perspective matters and that's rare in a children's story chalk full of serial killers taken together a little supervision in a school where children are constantly dying or being put in near death scenarios sounds not just great but the minimum responsibility of the government dumbledore may be a great resistance warrior but he's a questionable educator  might be a decent chosen one but he's not a model student umbridge may not be a good enabler of prophecy but do we need to keep ragging on the one teacher who actually wants to school to be a place of learning no offense to mr binns,genuin take

school to be a place of learn no offens to mr binn,"Genuine take: Umbridge is a good guy with an unfair rap - and I have evidence **Genuine take: Professor Umbridge is a sane and moral actor, who seems evil only when viewed through the eyes of a particular teenager.** The evidence is an analytical look at her major decisions in pseudo-chronological order:  1. **She interferes at Hogwarts**   &gt; ""'I'll tell you what it means,' said Hermione through gritted teeth. &gt; 'It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.'""   Terrific, oversight seems very reasonable. The ministry is only there because last year the headmaster decided to bring back a sporting event that was cancelled because of *too many deaths*, and a student immediately died again. The surrounding events are confusing, (readers [have](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/18122/why-was-the-triwizard-cup-portkey-in-goblet-of-fire-two-way) [a lot](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/23194/during-priori-incantatem-how-did-cedric-bertha-lily-and-james-know-so-much-i?rq=1) [of questions](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/129193/how-did-harry-know-that-the-portkey-was-layered)), but it's rooted in the fact that the headmaster hired a close friend despite a consensus this person was unhinged, and the friend wound up being a serial-killer. The headmaster didn't notice his old friend was actually someone completely different. This is different than the close friend the headmaster hired two years ago who attacked students as a werewolf... or the hire four years ago who attacked students in the murder-dungeon (why is that in a school, again?)... or the hire three years ago who attacked students and tried to wipe their memory (same year the board of trustees voted to have the headmaster removed for incompetency)... In fact, the ministry wouldn't be here at all, *even given all this*, if the headmaster had been able to hire a new DADA teacher.    ----------   2. **She doesn't want to teach *applied* DADA**. Makes sense to me, ([other](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/7436/does-hogwarts-teach-non-magical-classes) [readers](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/7436/does-hogwarts-teach-non-magical-classes?noredirect=1& lq=1) [are confused](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/18556/did-defense-against-the-dark-arts-before-barty-crouch-teach-any-actual-defense) about the curriculum too); the kids aren't learning math, should murder class really be anything more than academic? Yes, the last teacher had them practice torture spells, but I agree with Umbridge tbh, probably not a terrific idea. You can disagree with her pedagogy here, but it's hard to form a case this is ""evil"". Muggle parents get upset over books with swears in them, I can't imagine what they'd say if we were practicing torture methods in gym class.   ----------   3. **Umbridge doesn't believe Cedric was murdered or Voldemort is back**. Um... should she? The facts:  - **People died... at a death game.** Dumbledore brought back a game cancelled because of all the deaths - Dragon-Provoking was round two - and someone died. That isn't.... super duper unexpected.    - **Harry is traumatized and not making much sense** After returning Harry is immediately assaulted by a teacher. He starts babbling things like '*the person I fear most came back from the dead and all these important people in my life were Death Eaters. Oh no not the three death eaters sitting with you at the time, those were the ONLY three that didn't show. And my dead parents were there too! Then the portkey brought me back to here for some reason*'. Okay... Keep in mind other students had been confudus'd or imperious'd already during the  event.  - **The story is full of holes, with an obvious alternate explanation**. The portkey thing [is the smallest part that doesn't make sense](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/18122/why-was-the-triwizard-cup-portkey-in-goblet-of-fire-two-way). And you defeated Voldemort AGAIN to escape?! The serial killer in the room has claimed responsibility for the death of the student, which kind of fits.   - **Dumbledore makes a terrible case**. He doesn't say: '*this is kind of my fault*,' or '*let's talk about this away from the traumatized children*'. He says: '*you have to get rid of ALL your prison guards RIGHT NOW*.' Hold up Dumbledore, for a smart guy that wasn't a brilliant thing to say, you sort of sounds like a crank.   - **Nobody else believes Harry** Maybe that's why not just the minister of magic and the major newspaper, but the International Wizemgemot too think Dumbledore is crazy. Of course, Harry claims all those people are bought-and-paid-for... but do have any independent reason to believe that about the international community? It's not unheard of for famous people to become ranting conspiracy theorists in their old age, and Occam's razor agrees with Dolores *and almost everyone else in the wizarding world* on this one. If this makes Dolores evil, is like, the whole wizarding world evil too?    ----------   4. **She has Harry write lines for detention, in his own blood, leading to permanent scars**. This is definitely icky, but lets look at it in context.    - **This is a milder wizard detention than others we've seen** The morally unimpeachable McGonagall's detention pick for *first year students out past curfew* was going into the *forbidden forest*, unaccompanied except by a fearful dog, to hunt down a thing that was killing unicorns. Wait, what? Everyone almost died to a monster, unsurprisingly, until a centaur saved them against its nature. Especially in comparison to what Filch admits happened in living memory, writing lines doesn't seem so bad:  &gt; ""It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by &gt; your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still &gt; in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed"" - Filch    - **Harry can't stay out of detention** It's extra gross because of the blood component, but that's mostly for ick factor - the scars clearly aren't meant to be permanent (other students have them wear right off) - but Harry *keeps* getting detention. Unjustly? He stands up the very first day of class and shouts at the teacher that she's a liar. He disrupts constantly. He gets into fist fights, and tries to start an army at school. From Umbridge's perspective, she has a very distributed young student, and giving him detention far lighter than McGonagall assigned to mischievous freshman is about in-line with what we've seen in-universe.   ----------   5. **She tries to stop Dumbledore's Army**. Umbridge gets a credible tip that a troublesome student is trying to - checks notes - start an army to overthrow her and the government. What does she do? Requests that official school clubs register with the school, something that almost every school in the world already does. (It's also a good way to allocate funding - two birds one stone!) She doesn't go on the war path or interrogate anyone out the gate. It's only when the students *go ahead and secretly start revolution club anyways* that she starts a low-key investigation, with the support of many of the existing students at the school. You know, the ones who want to learn from the book, and not foster guerilla armies.   ----------   4. **She suspends the Griffindore Quidditch team**.   - Nothing she has done has gotten through to Harry - he's still on a downward spiral that (SPOILER) leads to him getting his godfather killed and wrecking Dumbeldore's office. Literally no adult is supporting this kid emotionally. Other members of the Quidditch team - the Weasley twins - are so well known for their misbehavior that it's a meme; they wind up dropping out and ruining exams. Maybe this is what will get through to them that they need to behave - can you imagine if half of the soccer team at your highschool was constantly in detention and violent? Telling the team they need to behave academically to maintain their sport sounds pretty reasonable to me.   - What happens when Dolores gets overruled? The *very first game* the players get into fist fights. Yikes, guess she was right. Btw, what's McGonagall's game here in going over Umbridge's head - McGonagall believes there's a serial killer mounting a coup and this is the hill she dies on?   ----------   5. *She files for more power*. What other options did she have? She was a government auditor brought in because students were routinely dying or getting maimed, and she literally can't discipline students by - checks notes - kicking them off a sports team? She's being blocked at the most basic levels of discipline.    ----------   6. **She audits the teachers, firing good ol' Hagrid and Trelawney**.   &gt; ""'I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old &gt; fraud."" - Hermione. &gt;   &gt; ""The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge &gt; within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation, &gt; hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it"".   This is strong evidence in her favor. If she was really just trying to set up Harry and Dumbledore, she would have immediately gone to fire McGonagall and Snape, his two closest allies. After all, she had wide latitude in interpreting the audit results. But she doesn't, she passes McGonagall with flying colors  and she questions Sanpe on his former ties to terrorism and evident lack of full trust from the headmaster - both fair questions. Trelawney isn't even a real teacher, she's just a pawn in some long term chess game that Dumbledore is playing (he laughs that he'd give her a raise after her third actual prediction). The trio feels bad for Hagrid, but Hermione had long said he was a terrible (sometimes dangerous) teacher with no qualifications who was hired because... why again? The trio didn't even want to take his class, even as his close personal friend. Not to mention all the class he's been skipping, or the *several* dangerous human-eating monsters he's secretly brought to or near campus. The school has had a lot of hiring problems recently, most famously the serial killer masquerading as Dumbledore's best friend: these are the exact type of things a responsible auditor would scrutinize.   ----------   7. **She threatens Harry with an unforgivable curse and Azkaban.** Let's look at the scene: a lot of waving her wand and dramatically flipping over Fudge's picture. Not a lot of actual spellcasting. If you think Umbridge is evil, then the will to do this fits with her style, but even so, it should seem *extremely* out-of-character. She follows the book to-the-t. She doesn't fire McGonagall or Snape, even when legalistically she could, because she's religiously bound by the law. She concedes immediately when Dumbledore hires a new Divinitation professor and insists Trelawny stays on campus even though it's all highly irregular. She always diligently files for more power, she doesn't stretch the power she already has - bureaucracy is her favorite thing in the world. Can you really imagine her casting unforgivable curses not just in front of a ton of witnesses, but the children of important and powerful Ministry Officials, like Malfoy? Sure, they like her, but that sounds like a rumor that'll spread. And for what gain? To save some time that doesn't need to be saved. This seems like textbook every teacher or procedural-cop-show ever: ""oh if you don't confess right this second we'll expel you/throw you in prison/tell your parents/whatever."" Threatening emptily is very in-character - and it worked (sort of). Actually doing it would be wildly un-Umbridgey and downright stupid.    ----------   8. **She insults the centaurs**. Out of universe, centaurs may be stand-ins for any number of marginalized groups. But in universe... they... don't really make great metaphors. They brutally attack each other and school characters repeatedly. We don't see them doing almost anything else. She seems afraid of them immediately and they... violently assault her leaving her catatonic in the hospital. They were provoked, surely, but saying they were justified is a *lot* of latitude. We see this with Werewolves too - out of universe, we think of them as symbols of discrimination, but in-universe, the only two Werewolves we see are Lupin and Greyback. The former - a certified ""good guy"" - attacks and almost kills his best friend and students because he loses control in his first book, and the latter gleefully attacks and murders people constantly. Without projecting our out-of-universe biases, I'm not sure we have enough information to say whether the metaphor really holds up.   ----------   9. **She sends the dementors after Harry**. But does she?   &gt; ""'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore.   &gt; 'I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of &gt; Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!' barked Fudge.   &gt; 'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the &gt; Ministry of Magic these days.'""  Right, Dumbledore thinks Voldemort did it. In fact, this is the exact thing Dumbledore warned Fudge about at the end of the last book. In the next book it's confirmed Voldemort is controlling the dementors, and in this book there's a prison break that highly suggests it. How would Umbridge have done this without a paper trail? Waltz up to the most guarded prison on Earth and politely ask the guards? More to the point, *why* would she? Did she genuinely hate this kid she'd never met so much to take such a huge personal risk? Again, it's wildly out of character - everything we *directly* see her do is to-the-letter legal. She *loves* laws. So why'd she say she did it? Well, it's in the same monologue as (8) - Harry challenges whether her threat is serious and she goes 'oh I'm super duper serious, I even sent those dementors just like you thought I did!!'. Right, sure. This seems like more evidence that 8 was empty threats. Even when Umbridge is headmaster, she doesn't expel Harry without cause even though she could without risk, but she risks it all to kill him out the gate? Hmm.   ----------   10. **She participates in a court against non pure-bloods**. Not a great look. But keep in mind she'd (SPOILER) had a Horcrux on for months at this point. When Ron had to carry the same Horcrux, on and off, for a little while, he straight up abandons his friends and the fate of the world and goes home to his brother. Ginny hung out with a diary Horcrux and tried to murder half the school and a few chickens and a cat. Dumbledore got hoodwinked by a horcrux in like 2 seconds (could be unrelated, admittedly). We don't damn those characters, so let's give Umbridge the same benefit.   ----------  11. **She uses Veritaserum on students**  - Snape says   &gt; ""Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry &gt; guidelines""   and she seems like the exact person in place to file for that kind of approval.  ----------   **What do characters outside the trio think?**  Percy praises her. Fudge has promoted her to undersecretary. And importantly, Scrimgeour keeps her onboard too. We can nitpick the first two, but Scrimgeour is a pretty ethical dude - he dies under torture to keep Harry safe. Madam Bones seems to work closely with her and everyone loves Bones. The people who have worked with her all give her the marks of a practical and diligent public servant.  **Conclusion:**  Through the eyes of a teenager, Umbridge is the ultimate evil - just like we all thought our least-favorite teacher was in high school, but with higher stakes. I think this is a good thing - Umbridge is written well as a character with enough internal justification for her actions that perspective matters, and that's rare in a children's story chalk full of serial killers. Taken together, a little supervision in a school where children are constantly dying or being put in near-death scenarios sounds not just great, but the minimum responsibility of the government. Dumbledore may be a great resistance warrior, but he's a questionable educator. Harry might be a decent chosen-one, but he's not a model student. Umbridge may not be a good enabler-of-prophecy, but do we need to keep ragging on the one teacher who actually wants to school to be a place of... learning (no offense to Mr. Binns)?"

3008,how aragog could have come to hagrid  through newt theory hi there for a while now we have known that the acromantula aragog prior to coming into hagrid s possession travelled to england as an egg in the pockets of a traveller almost certainly newt s suitcase yet something did not make sense from the start why would an experienced magizoologist the best in his field probably at the peak of his sucess and establishment at  give a significantly large egg that he should recognize to a thirteen year old boy unless he experiences the classic mistake of being too secure in his own abilities that every human especially those in high professions is met with sooner or later there may be another way jk rowling stated that the next movie will take place in  and i m pretty sure this is also when newt and tina finally get together and marry/have their first child now said child may have a few friends why not the son of mr hagrid ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ friends from the north we know that they used to live in the forrest of dean in england where hagrid was born but never learned what mr hagrid was doing for a living but since he fell in love with and married a giant that might just be his expertise who knows maybe he even is/becomes friends with newt being kind of an outsider in the wizarding community as well due to his interest in the giant species which is even heavier frowned upon than magical creatures all the way into the  i wouldn t put it past that they start visiting each other and newt s child/ren along with their cousins etc quickly bond with young hagrid who is happy that they are friendlier to him than most kids having grown up learning from their entire small family and alongside all kinds stranger creatures of course he is at least seven years the senior of the oldest child but i can see him as a gentle older brother figure i can also see him getting along well with newt maybe this is exactly where his interest in magical creatures began __________________________________________________ a brave little sibling now when hagrid enters hogwarts the oldest child of newt and tina is at least  years old and  around the time he is expelled just the age to start making more or less thought through decisions what if he or she learns that hagrid is afraid of going back to hogwarts after his father s death because his grief is still too strong what if the child cannot stand the thought of him being alone with this and steals an egg from newt s case or the hospital maybe simply because it s big and somehow makes sure hagrid doesn t tell anyone maybe sneaking a package into his hogwarts luggage signed with a newt scamander sigil who knows maybe newt had the idea of giving him a pet as well though a more harmless one which his child either didn t know about or found out too late either way the truth eventually surfaces along with hagrid s expulsion and i m sure the poor child will be in great distress thinking it is fully to blame for it yet i m pretty sure noone will be mad at the child since it only wanted hagrid to be happy/not alone and was more than willing to break the rules for it sounds like an excuse the scamander parents would accept it would be a cute story about friendship and even a light in the story of how hagrid was expelled in the way that he could be used as a scrapegoat by tom riddle because of something latter would only find once and much later a true friend

known that the Acromantula Aragog, prior to coming into Hagrid’s possession, travelled to England as an egg, in the pockets of a traveller - almost certainly Newt’s suitcase.  Yet, something did not make sense from the start - why would an experienced magizoologist, the best in his field, probably at the peak of his sucess and establishment at 45/46, give a significantly large egg that he should recognize to a thirteen-year old boy?  Unless he experiences the classic mistake of being too secure in his own abilities that every human, especially those in high professions, is met with sooner or later, there may be another way …  JK Rowling stated that the next movie will take place in 1935, and I’m pretty sure this is also when Newt and Tina finally get together and marry/have their first child.  Now, said child may have a few friends … why not the son of Mr. Hagrid?  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________   **Friends from the north**  We know that they used to live in the Forrest of Dean in England where Hagrid was born, but never learned what Mr. Hagrid was doing for a living … but since he fell in love with and married a giant, that might just be his expertise.  Who knows, maybe he even is/becomes friends with Newt, being kind of an outsider in the wizarding community as well due to his interest in the giant species (which is even heavier frowned upon than magical creatures, all the way into the 1990s).  I wouldn’t put it past that they start visiting each other and Newt’s child/ren, along with their cousins etc., quickly bond with young Hagrid, who is happy that they are friendlier to him than most kids (having grown up learning from their entire small family and alongside all kinds stranger creatures). Of course, he is at least seven years the senior of the oldest child, but I can see him as a gentle older brother figure :)  I can also see him getting along well with Newt - maybe this is exactly where his interest in magical creatures began?   __________________________________________________   **A brave little sibling**  Now, when Hagrid enters Hogwarts, the oldest child of Newt and Tina is at least 6 years old - and 7/8 around the time he is expelled… just the age to start making more or less thought-through decisions.  What if he or she learns that Hagrid is afraid of going back to Hogwarts after his father’s death, because his grief is still too strong?  What if the child cannot stand the thought of him being alone with this and steals an egg from Newt’s case or the hospital (maybe simply because it’s big), and somehow makes sure Hagrid doesn’t tell anyone (maybe sneaking a package into his Hogwarts luggage, signed with a Newt Scamander sigil?) ?  Who knows, maybe Newt had the idea of giving him a pet as well, though a more harmless one … which his child either didn’t know about or found out too late.  Either way, the truth eventually surfaces along with Hagrid’s expulsion, and I’m sure the poor child will be in great distress, thinking it is fully to blame for it. Yet I’m pretty sure noone will be mad at the child, since it only wanted Hagrid to be happy/not alone and was more than willing to break the rules for it - sounds like an excuse the Scamander parents would accept :)  It would be a cute story about friendship, and even a light in the story of how Hagrid was expelled … in the way that he could be used as a scrapegoat by Tom Riddle because of something latter would only find once and much later -  a true friend.  __________________________________________________________________________   What do you think? Could this be the way in which Hagrid received Aragog?  (I hope I got all the dates right - it was a little difficult since Hagrid was born in december)  Thank you very much for reading :)"
3942,the chastity case theory spoiler alert hello people oh   this movie keeps me by the mental screen with it s endless clues to future sequels and possibilities for character stories what i want to discuss today is the mystery around mary lou barebone s adoptive daughter chastity something is definitly odd about her and today i want to theorize on what she could be enjoy _________________________________________ the silent observer chastity so far seems to kind of fade away in the background aside credence and modesty she still is kind of an authority figure for the children who come to the salemer s house and gives orders to them yet there is something that makes me suspicious she keeps observing credence or watches the situation as if she was ordered to and when he is shortly before an outbreak of magic she seems to be alarmed as if knowing what is about to happen we don t get to know much about her in the entire movie and yet she always is present like literally waiting to show more of herself and her story almost as if jk rowling was building her up in silence to later reveal her indeed great part in this story but what is it about her why is she observing credence what are her true intentions i thought about it today for a while and i figured there is actually more to her just not to her my theory is that for a great part of the movie we only see someone who took the real chastitiy s place ______________________________________________ a macusa spy the macusa has been keeping an eye on the first salemers for quite a while when the movie takes place they were no serious threat but one that certainly should not be underestimated through their constant propaganda and dependence on existence of magic people my theory is that they wanted to be informed as well as possible about this group s intentions and send a spy to the orphanage they most likely decided observed and then abducted the actual chastity barebone if they didn t use a spell for the disguise they definitely required her hair for the polyjuice potion thus to keep her alive and yes polyjuice can give elder people the appearance of a younger person for a certain amount of time i strongly believe this spy didn t just give them information but also suspected after a while that either credence or modesty could be magical and here we get to something that might fit with a spy for macusa ____________________________________________________________________ percival graves investigation how did graves know about modesty who gave him the information that a wizard or witch might be among the children in the orphanage what if the actual graves and later grindelwald got the information from the spy at the orphanage what if she knew about obscurials and asked him to investigate we know is the head of the auror section in the american ministry of magic and certainly whoever took chastities place is one by the end we see the girl s body lying on the ground yet if she was magic she could have dissaparated and replaced her body with a convincing magic fake one ______________________________________________________________ a dead body the script describes that her corpse is seen lying on the floor after credence had his obscurial outbreak at the orphanage yet when he did break out she was suddenly gone from the chair she had been sitting on while watching the scene and it might be possible that in the spy business of the magic world it is common to be able to leave a fake dead body a trained wizard may find out quickly that it isn t real but a muggle they are easily fooled using magic how could they ever find out it was fake if macusa replaced the real chastity with a spy from the ministry a fellow fan said to me that this might be one reason why tina was banned from the investigation on the second salemers they already had a spy so let s assume she is a trained auror mabye on polyjuice maybe even a senior as we both agreed there would be no problem if she just disaparated once creed s magic started to explode _____________________________________________ where is chastity so if a spy entered and left the second salemers without being spotted where is the real chastity things go dark now i believe that if the macusa doesn t have any other magic in use for shape shifting the girl migh be held captive and kept alive to use her hair for polyjuice much in the fashion of mad eye moody i don t think this is impossible we have seen the macusa s death sentence policy their attidude towards muggles and i still believe from grindelwald s words by the end that there might even be something going on with him also since she was confirmed dead actually it s both possible that they obliviate her and let her go under a new identity maybe change her memory since she is an orphan with no actual relations outside the second salemers or they decide since her body was found it s too dangerous to let her go will we see her again i do believe so i think at some point of the story one of the characteres most likely creed will be brought to a secluded area within the ministry who knows if they won t try to exploit him as well and meet her there maybe spotting her in another cell and rescuing her i wonder how the story will go on since she most likely will have no idea about the obscurial attacks in new york and creed s new life ________________________________________________ so what do you think is it possible that chastities death was fake and are her and the spy s stories yet to come anyway let me know in the comments if you want to add something to this theory maybe i m completely wrong and there is an entirely different explanation for chastitie s behaviour thank you very much for reading and a big

Something is definitly odd about her, and today I want to theorize on what she could be…  Enjoy :)  _________________________________________   **The silent observer**  Chastity so far seems to kind of fade away in the background aside Credence and Modesty. She still is kind of an authority figure for the children who come to the Salemer’s house and gives orders to them.  Yet there is something that makes me suspicious … she keeps observing Credence, or watches the situation, as if she was ordered to… and when he is shortly before an outbreak of magic, she seems to be alarmed, as if knowing what is about to happen.  We don’t get to know much about her in the entire movie, and yet she always is present, like literally waiting to show more of herself and her story, almost as if JK Rowling was building her up in silence, to later reveal her indeed great part in this story… But what is it about her? Why is she observing Credence, what are her true intentions?I thought about it today for a while and I figured there is actually more to her… just not to her. My theory is that, for a great part of the movie … we only see someone who took the real Chastitiy’s place.    ______________________________________________   **A MACUSA spy?**  The MACUSA has been keeping an eye on the First Salemers for quite a while when the movie takes place. They were no serious threat, but one that certainly should not be underestimated through their constant propaganda and dependence on existence of magic people. My theory is that they wanted to be informed as well as possible about this group’s intentions and send a spy to the orphanage. They most likely decided, observed and then abducted the actual Chastity Barebone. If they didn’t use a spell for the disguise, they definitely required her hair for the polyjuice potion, thus to keep her alive.  And yes, polyjuice can give elder people the appearance of a younger person for a certain amount of time.  I strongly believe this spy didn’t just give them information, but also suspected after a while that either Credence or Modesty could be magical.  And here we get to something that might fit with a spy for MACUSA…   ____________________________________________________________________   **Percival Graves’ investigation**  How did Graves know about Modesty? Who gave him the information that a wizard or witch might be among the children in the orphanage?  What if the actual Graves and later Grindelwald got the information from the spy at the orphanage? What if she knew about obscurials, and asked him to investigate? We know is the head of the auror section in the american ministry of magic, and certainly whoever took Chastities place is one.  By the end, we see the girl’s body lying on the ground… yet if she was magic, she could have dissaparated and replaced her body with a convincing magic fake one...     ______________________________________________________________    **A dead body**  The script describes that her corpse is seen lying on the floor after Credence had his obscurial outbreak at the orphanage… yet, when he did break out, she was suddenly gone from the chair she had been sitting on while watching the scene … and it might be possible that in the spy business of the magic world, it is common to be able to leave a fake dead body… a trained wizard may find out quickly that it isn’t real, but a muggle… they are easily fooled using magic. How could they ever find out it was fake?   If MACUSA replaced the real Chastity with a spy from the ministry… a fellow fan said to me that this might be one reason why Tina was banned from the investigation on the Second Salemers… they already had a spy.  So, let’s assume she is a trained auror, mabye on Polyjuice, maybe even a senior, as we both agreed - there would be no problem if she just disaparated once Creed’s magic started to explode.  _____________________________________________   **Where is Chastity?**  So, if a spy entered and left the Second Salemers without being spotted… where is the real Chastity?  Things go dark now.  I believe that, if the MACUSA doesn’t have any other magic in use for shape-shifting, the girl migh be held captive and kept alive to use her hair for polyjuice, much in the fashion of Mad-Eye Moody. I don’t think this is impossible. We have seen the MACUSA’s death sentence policy, their attidude towards muggles… and I still believe from Grindelwald’s words by the end that there might even be something going on with him. Also, since she was confirmed dead… actually, it’s both possible that they obliviate her and let her go under a new identity (maybe change her memory) since she is an orphan with no actual relations outside the Second Salemers, or they decide, since her body was found, it’s too dangerous to let her go.   **Will we see her again?**   I do believe so. I think at some point of the story, one of the characteres, most likely Creed, will be brought to a secluded area within the ministry (who knows if they won’t try to exploit him as well) and meet her there, maybe spotting her in another cell and rescuing her. I wonder how the story will go on since she most likely will have no idea about the obscurial attacks in New York and Creed’s new life.  ________________________________________________   So, what do you think? Is it possible that Chastities death was fake? And are her and the spy’s stories yet to come?   Anyway, let me know in the comments if you want to add something to this theory. Maybe I’m completely wrong and there is an entirely different explanation for Chastitie’s behaviour.  Thank you very much for reading, and a big thanks to my fellow fan rebelliouspuritanboy on Tumblr for helping me with this :)"

Now I talked a bit about this on why Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite movie but i wanted to talk a little bit more on this.     Lycanthropy is a disease. And Rowling treats it like that. So many forms of media that feature vampires or werewolves show werewolves as like these creatures that sometimes have to go away when there's a full moon. Sure it's painful but it doesn't impact their lives in any other way aside from the fact that, whenever there's a full moon they gotta go. But in Harry Potter you can see Lupin getting weaker and more agitated. In the movie he's limping and struggling. Even having to take time off of class because of how bad he feels. It's not just some inconvenience, it is a disease.  & #   I love that. It's such a good way of not only enhancing our world view but also shedding light on something that most people would think to be pretty great. At least i did. ""Once in awhile i transform into this super powerful creature of the night? Sign my ass up!"" But it's so much more then that. It's painful and irritating. You can see it and experience it. After watching Harry Potter i didn't wanna be a werewolf anymore. It just looks like suffering and it's supposed to.      Now I'm not gonna sit here and claim the Rowling is the first to do it, since I don't know. But I will comfortably say that her depiction of Lycanthropy is one of my favorites."

First of all, all series gave us a different world which belongs to wizards and they were different. The fashion is especially important to create this effect. When you looked Dumbledore in old movies, you could feel this, but in this movie, the line separate the two world is a little bit vanished. All wizards are almost like Clark Kent. They are hiding as a normal people but if there are trouble, they take off their glasses and begin to fly. Has the fashion developed later in the wizarding world ? When dumbledore decide to wear his clothes which we saw in Harry Potter movies ?   Second, all movie is like a theater with its stages and there are no connectivity between these stages. If it was a final project in an art school, it would be fail. Was there no one watch this movie before it was delivered? Or did they complete it too fast?    This movie would far more better than this and should be, because the actors and the Harry Potter universe have a great potential. They shouldn’t waste it."

Might turn out to be Graves.  He was obviously a popular character from the first film with a lot of folk admiring colin farrells performance and im pretty sure I might have spotted a few clues on his possible return.  First off, it would make complete sense thst Graves would want a new identity, probably feeling ashamed about being tricked by Grindelwald and putting others at risk, not to mention how others might treat him going forward.  They mention his name at least once and Jacob laughs, almost like its a made up name. Newt stresses for the second time in the movie that he's a auror to really establish that point. Lastly, the first film makes it clear Tina and Graves did have at least a working relationship before she was demoted and he his identity was assumed by Grindelwald, so perhaps with her being upset over Newts ""engagement"" and him feeling ashamed they somehoe comforted each other."

Even if they didn't yet have the wand  they knew the lore about the wand's allegaince.  If they couldn't make a move against each other it would prevent them from stealing it from one another and switching allegiance.  But then the allegiance would be to both of them and if either was disarmed the wand would default to the other. So maybe that's how Dumbledore got the wand at the end when Tina disarmed Grindelwald it switch to Dumbledore but still obey Grindelwald since they cant make a move against the other one.
3634,spoilers after finally seeing crimes of grindelwald i'm honestly surprised with all the mixed reviews and fan impressions i've read here i was expecting to hate it but i thought it was great not excellent but for sure not as awful as some people here are making it out to be the main thing i want to bring up is that it's not that hard to understand could things have been explained more clearly definitely but with all the fuss everyone was making and all the stories i've heard about lifelong  not being able to understand the plot i was expecting to walk out scratching my head i'm a casual hp fan and i felt that though there were only one or two confusing bits all this we couldn't even summarize the plot after we've seen it seems to be coming from people who weren't paying attention because basically everything made sense it was just a little muddled a fair criticism and one i agree with i'm especially surprised that people didn't understand the credence/corvus baby switch because i thought that was made pretty clear in our group of  only one person felt they had a tough time understanding the movie and it was because they had last seen the first movie  years ago to be fair i'm a fan of the first movie more so than other people i think so i was looking forward to this in truth i felt that the plot was better explained in this movie than in the first one the first movie took me a rewatch to fully understand the obscurus thing but i don't feel like anything in this movie confused me that much obviously there were things i didn't think worked spoilers ahead i think we were given a very poor explanation for queenie to join grindelwald this is the most frustrating thing i thought there were some abrupt scenes and it wasn't always clear which city we were in between london paris new york i wish nagini had been given more to do less mad about this because she'll obviously be in the sequels not enough dumbledore jude law was great some timeline discrepancies mcgonagall credence being a dumbledore etc but i suspect some of these will be explained away in future movies the final battle with grindelwald was great until there was the giant blue flame dragon thing which they had to contain i felt that was overkill and the battle should have ended in the crypt with grindelwald there i got a sense that this is a place setting movie to prepare for future installments hence all the many plots but again i think if you're an astute viewer this won't really confuse you at all now for the things i think really worked johnny depp as grindelwald hell yes whatever doubts people had should be erased by this movie he was absolutely  and stole the show i think the score by james newton howard was beautiful newt as a character remains really endearing and likable in a shy awkward sort of way his love subplot with tina was lovely flashbacks to hogwarts and newt/leta's childhood was very poignant and beautifully done it was also awesome to

Grindelwald... I'm honestly surprised! With all the mixed reviews and fan impressions I've read here I was expecting to hate it, but I thought it was great. NOT excellent, but for sure not as awful as some people here are making it out to be.  The main thing I want to bring up is that it's not that hard to understand. Could things have been explained more clearly? Definitely. But with all the fuss everyone was making and all the stories I've heard about ""lifelong Potterheads not being able to understand the plot"" I was expecting to walk out scratching my head. I'm a casual HP fan and I felt that though there were only one or two confusing bits. All this ""We couldn't even summarize the plot after we've seen it!!!!"" seems to be coming from people who weren't paying attention because basically everything made sense...it was just a little muddled (a fair criticism and one I agree with). I'm especially surprised that people didn't understand the Credence/Corvus baby switch because I thought that was made pretty clear. In our group of 7, only one person felt they had a tough time understanding the movie and it was because they had last seen the first movie 2 years ago.  To be fair, I'm a fan of the first movie (more so than other people I think) so I was looking forward to this. In truth I felt that the plot was better explained in this movie than in the first one (the first movie took me a rewatch to fully understand the Obscurus thing, but I don't feel like anything in this movie confused me that much).   Obviously there were things I didn't think worked (SPOILERS AHEAD):  * I think we were given a very poor explanation for Queenie to join Grindelwald (this is the most frustrating thing) * I thought there were some abrupt scenes and it wasn't always clear which city we were in between London, Paris, New York * I wish Nagini had been given more to do (less mad about this because she'll obviously be in the sequels) * Not enough Dumbledore (Jude Law was great) * Some timeline discrepancies (McGonagall, Credence being a Dumbledore, etc) but I suspect some of these will be explained away in future movies * The final battle with Grindelwald was great, UNTIL there was the giant blue-flame-dragon thing which they had to contain. I felt that was overkill and the battle should have ended in the crypt with Grindelwald there. * I got a sense that this is a ""place-setting"" movie to prepare for future installments, hence all the many plots, but again I think if you're an astute viewer this won't really confuse you at all.  Now for the things I think REALLY worked:  * Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Hell yes. Whatever doubts people had should be erased by this movie, he was absolutely fantastic and stole the show I think. * The score by James Newton Howard was beautiful * Newt as a character remains really endearing and likable in a shy, awkward sort of way. His love subplot with Tina was lovely. * Flashbacks to Hogwarts and Newt/Leta's childhood was very poignant and beautifully done. * It was also awesome to be back in Hogwarts present-day. * Really fantastic visual effects * Jude Law (again) * It retains a lot of the heart and humor of the original. Granted, not as much humor as the first one, but Jacob, the Niffler(s), and a few other characters provide some comic relief in a genuine, heartfelt way.  Things that I think everyone is nitpicking:  * The plot being difficult to understand (just watch the movie and pay attention, people) * Nagini (yes we needed more, but we will obviously see her in the sequels. She needed to be introduced at some point) * Credence reveal and other timeline discrepancies. Perhaps mistakes, perhaps will be explained away * ""It's not as good as Harry Potter!!!"" Of course not, these movies didn't have a book series with already-developed and lovable characters to be excited about. As far as original movie stories go, I've been happy with all of the characters so far.  TL;DR: Movie isn't that confusing. It's not perfect and was probably not as good as the first one, but I felt it was a worthy sequel to the first and appears to be setting the stage for what will probably be a really exciting next chapter in the story."

If we just put aside the fact that she might have been a complete fraud and just said these things for no reason, then let's consider why she prophesied his death and suffering so much.   Since Harry was a horcrux and was harbouring a part of Voldemort's soul, maybe she was predicting the future for Voldemort too. Particularly during PoA, Voldemort had suffering in the near future - being reborn and living as some kind of disgusting gremlin thing.   Then throughout the series he was undergoing even more suffering because his soul was slowly being destroyed, one piece at a time, and then ultimately dies in DH.  Of course, Harry also did deserve some of the predictions of suffering, but barring the killing of his horcrux in the Forbidden Forest, most of it was emotional.   & #   Please let me know if I've missed something here..."

I always thought it was pretty funny how in POA Ron and Harry, who in the past two books show that they are always willing to get to the bottom of a mystery, always wanting to follow the clues to the answer, completely dismiss Hermione’s impossible class schedule!  There are a few references throughout the book (Ron seems to be the one to bring it up the most) talking about how on earth Hermione can be attending two classes at the same time, or how she’s able to handle all of her schoolwork. But every time it’s brought up, they essentially shrug their shoulders and go “meh. Not my business.”  I totally get how this works for the story, I just always found it funny how the first two books set up Harry and Ron (and Hermione of course) as these “investigators” or “detectives” who can’t let a mystery pass them by without doing everything they can to solve it, and then when something REALLY FUCKING INTERESTING is going on with their BEST FRIEND of two years, they treat it like a vaguely interesting piece of trivia. Lol."

3680,people who think grindlewald is lying about credence s identity they re wrong spoilers hearing a lot of talk about the reveal at the very end of the movie not making sense this is odd to me as this reveal makes the first movie make a lot more sense here is why  grindlewald going to america after an obscurial makes more sense after this movie how did gg know to go and look for the obscurial in the first place well i think he must have found out that the kendra dumbledore died on the ship to america all from the lestrange servant newt was sent to america to find credence and grindlewald was there too i think dumbledore knew who credence is or at least suspected him to be the child of the prophecy  so grindlewald goes to america to find the child only to discover that an obscurial is on the loose in new york think about this he knew ariana was an obscurial he was there when she died he wasn t after the obscurial power altogether he was after a weapon against dumbledore he deduces that credence is related to dumbledore  in tcog he purposefully leads credence to the lestrange servant and then has her killed before she can tell him more this drives credence to him  he verifies his belief that credence isn t the child of the prophecy isn t a lestrange at all from the records from the french ministry of magic he places this record for leta and co to find again driving credence to grindelwald  i believe the phoenix we see at the end of this movie is fawkes i believe credence is aurelius and grindlewald is not lying to him when he tells him this  why would kendra hide their brother from aberforth and albus because it s credence is their half brother the result of kendra s relationship with someone besides her husband who was in azkaban at the time  lastly why doesn t dumbledore tell anyone about credence in the hp books well dumbledore is infamously secretive i doubt aberforth even knows i mean albus doesn t need another black eye from his brother i

better stori,"People who think Grindlewald is lying about Credence’s identity. (They’re wrong.) *Spoilers* Hearing a lot of talk about the reveal at the very end of the movie not making sense. This is odd to me as this reveal makes the first movie make a lot more sense. Here is why:  1. Grindlewald going to America after an obscurial makes more sense after this movie. How did GG know to go and look for the obscurial in the first place. Well, I think he must have found out that the Kendra Dumbledore died on the ship to America, all from the Lestrange servant. Newt was sent to America to find Credence, and Grindlewald was there too. I think Dumbledore knew who Credence is, or at least suspected him to be the child of the prophecy.  2. So Grindlewald goes to America to find the child, only to discover that an obscurial is on the loose in New York. Think about this: he knew Ariana was an obscurial. He was there when she died. He wasn’t after the obscurial power altogether, he was after a weapon against Dumbledore. He deduces that Credence is related to Dumbledore.   3. In TCOG, he purposefully leads Credence to the Lestrange servant, and then has her killed before she can tell him more. This drives Credence to him.  4. He verifies his belief that Credence isn’t the child of the prophecy, isn’t a Lestrange at all, from the records from the French Ministry of Magic. He places this record for Leta and co to find. Again, driving Credence to Grindelwald.   5. I believe the Phoenix we see at the end of this movie is Fawkes. I believe Credence is  Aurelius, and Grindlewald is not lying to him when he tells him this.  6. Why would Kendra hide their brother from Aberforth and Albus? Because it’s Credence is their half brother, the result of Kendra’s relationship with someone besides her husband—who was in Azkaban at the time.  7. Lastly: why doesn’t Dumbledore tell anyone about Credence in the HP books? Well, Dumbledore is infamously secretive. I doubt Aberforth even knows. I mean, Albus doesn’t need another black eye from his brother.  I realize some people hated this movie. But damn if this isn’t the pinnacle JK of plot lines and Dumbledore drama. I realize the movie has issues, but the story is engrossing and doesn’t try to hold your hand at all. If they canceled FB series tomorrow, I’d be fine with it as long as JK finished the story in book form. If FBCOG was a book, I’d bet it’d be one of her better stories."

758,draco malfoy the boy who made choices one of the reasons the draco was the boy who had no choice thing bothers me so much aside from how deeply it undercuts his both his agency and personal responsibility is that the the choices draco did make were so important he chose to lower his wand on the tower he chose not to kill dumbledore he made a choice as to the kind of person he wanted to be he chose not to identify  in the manor lucius was right if the malfoy s had been the ones to capture   they d have been showered in glory by voldemort and yet draco still didn t make it happen he

draco had choices he made choices he was used and manipulated by voldemort but he was fully on board with his mission until the reality of what he had to do sunk in he could have made things much easier for himself he stubbornly refused snape s offer of help because he wanted all the gory and it s interesting to me that the people who claim he had no choice tend to overlap a lot with people who claim draco was robbed of a redemption arc he wasn t his character arc was complete in the books and that makes no sense if you want him redeemed first you have to allow him responsibility for his

want it reveal that he d been a soft good guy all along and have  beg hi forgiv for misjudg him mayb that s extrem but i think there s at least a grain of truth in it,"Draco Malfoy–The Boy Who Made Choices One of the reasons the “Draco was the boy who had no choice” thing bothers me so much, aside from how deeply it undercuts his both his agency and personal responsibility, is that the the choices Draco did make were *so important*.  He chose to lower his wand on the tower. He chose not to kill Dumbledore. He made a choice as to the kind of person he wanted to be.   He chose not to identify Harry in the Manor. Lucius was right, if the Malfoy’s had been the ones to capture Harry Potter they’d have been showered in glory by Voldemort. And yet, Draco still didn’t make it happen.   He also chose to break Harry’s nose on the train and to cast an Unforgivable at him. Those choices are also important aspects of his character. You can’t understand Draco if you reduce him to a mindless pawn.  Draco had choices. He made choices. He was used and manipulated by Voldemort, but he was fully on board with his mission until the reality of what he had to do sunk in. He could have made things much easier for himself. He stubbornly refused Snape’s offer of help because he wanted all the gory.  And it’s interesting to me that the people who claim he had no choice tend to overlap a lot with people who claim Draco was robbed of a redemption arc. (He wasn’t. His character arc was complete in the books.) And that makes no sense. If you want him redeemed, first you have to allow him responsibility for his choices so he can atone for them.   I don’t think people really wanted him redeemed. I think they wanted it revealed that he’d been a soft, good guy all along and have Harry beg his forgiveness for misjudging him. Maybe that’s extreme, but I think there’s at least a grain of truth in it."

For those who remember it was none other than Professor McGonagall, who obtained it from the Ministry if Magic.   So, for those confused about the McGonagall cameo in the new Fantastic Beasts, I theorize that it is no one other Minerva McGonagall herself utilizing a time turner.   For clarification, yes Pottermore states that the use of a time-turner should be limited to 5 hours or less, however it is indisputable that Professor McGonagall is a master of her craft. She is arguably one of the best witches in the magical world at transfiguration. So it goes without saying that she would be more adept at time-travel, and such the usage of a time-turner, than the average witch or wizard."

If Voldemort had never heard it (or even heard of it), he wouldn't have detoured from his original plan of domination to attack Harry and his parent – and we all know how that went. His following, influence and power would've continued to increase and he would've been incredibly hard to defeat, if able to at all.  & #   Even if the same fate happened upon him – he was beaten (without making a Harry-horcrux) and slowly returned to power.

While Harry being a horcrux might have complicated things – if he didn't have the obsession and just focused on his plans then I can't see how they would've stopped him.  & #   Ultimately, without Sybill Trelawney, they would've been hard-pressed to defeat the Dark Lord – not because of what she said, but because of how Voldemort reacted to it.

3344,   was bad here's how i would've changed it ok first off sorry if you liked the movie but i thought it was bad like almost incomprehensible the plot was a mess the reveals were meaningless and even when the movie started to actually have focus it had been so boring and contrived that the set up for the next one was exhausting to get through j k rowling clearly writes books and not movies and that was apparent as the lack of focus or coherence can only be explained by an author who wants to have a myriad of storylines without the appropriate amount of time to cover them all so much goes nowhere and i think that could be easily fixed first the opening is fine good action engaging and easy to follow gets the plot moving i'd be fine keeping that the way it is after that it makes sense to follow newt who should be the definitive main character like in the last one establish his home life and have him meet his brother and establish his engagement to leta at the ministry drop the stupid tina thinks newt is marrying leta subplot the ministry scene can go down the way it did only with way less exposition have newt request to have his travel ban lifted and establish that it's in order to go to new york to see tina that gives him and the audience clear set goals have the ministry offer newt a job as a auror the catch being that he needs to find and kill creedence as newt is an expert on obscurials instead of having newt turn this down because of not wanting to pick sides have him turn it down because he's not a killer and instead of having the ministry hire some nameless goon to track him down have it be leta herself this offers some major conflict for later on have newt being tracked or whatever and dumbledore manages to get in contact with him anyway and the scene with newt and albus should go similarly to the movie except it should be dumbledore not the ministry who tips off newt that credence is in paris this establishes that dumbledore is one step ahead of them also have newt's change of heart come from the fact that dumbledore wants newt to rehabilitate credence rather than killing him when queen and jacob arrive at newt's place have it be for an actual reason instead of having it be seemingly inconsequential drop the meaningless subplot with the love spell and instead have queenie say that her and jacob are getting married secretly in england and then drop the bombshell that tina was tasked with tracking grindelwald by the american ministry and is now missing this further incentivizes newt to engage in this mission and he reveals to them that he has a lead as to where grindelwald might be instead of it just being jacob and newt queenie should also be joining them in illegally traveling to paris meanwhile in paris establish that credence is looking for clues of his heritage where he comes across the circus and sees nagini having him empathize with her have him meet with her after the show and have them establish a relationship rather than having a relationship that the audience didn't see later you can have creedence watching another performance only when things do go wrong have it be because credence saw nagini being abused and his obscurial came out thus making his presence in paris publicly known when the french ministry does show up to investigate have tina be one of the aurors working undercover for the american ministry yusuf kama whose presence felt entirely forced in the movie can be tina's superior and due to tina's knowledge of the obscurial is visibly suspicious of her have newt and co arrive at paris shortly after this happened and have newt do some magical creature nonsense to find out that tina had been in paris and have them be able to track down the circus that credence was at the scene where the ministry arrives at hogwarts and questions dumbledore as well as leta's flashback was essential to establishing the plot point of the blood oath for the audience as well as giving leta a bit more backstory and should probably be kept minus the nonsensical mcgonagall cameo the main change i would've made is to have dumbledore intentionally reveal newt's location to the ministry and therefore have him set up the later events as he has a habit for manipulating actions in order to reach an end goal at this point grindelwald would've heard about the attack at the circus and sends his followers to search for credence there have them searching the circus at the same time as newt and co and have queenie be able to read their minds and tell that they're working for grindelwald using the magical  they subdue them and with queenie's legilimacy are able to derive grindelwald's location before aurors come to arrest the followers tina is involved in arresting the followers and notices that the swooping evil was what had restrained them and puts together that newt is in paris credence and nagini still go to the orphanage where credence grew up and again they're left with more questions than answers the only difference being that instead of grindelwald's followers attacking credence is instead told that as a baby he was transported by a young girl rather than an adult this ties into the mystery element that wasn't properly expunged upon in the movie also if a scene needs to establish grindelwald as a proper villain have him learn about credence searching for answers and order the murder of this woman/house elf hybrid later newt and co are revealed to have stolen hairs off of the followers of grindelwald and on dumbledore's advice head to the paris safe house which is the home of nicolas flamel there flamel can have a similar scene as in the film except this time he serves a purpose which is to provide the trio with poly juice potion queenie and newt drink the potion and disguise themselves as grindelwald's followers to gain access to grindelwald's hideout and hopefully learn of credence's location while jacob stays with flamel tina is working at the ministry of france looking through newt's records from the english ministry when she stumbles across leta's file she's about to read it when yusuf calls her into his office and locks the door tina notices a strange mark on his arm when yusuf asks her how long she had been working for grindelwald tina denies this under the threat of death before finally admitting to being an american spy on the case to find credence barebone yusuf smiles telling her he gave her veretiserum earlier and says that he trusts her and wants her to help him track him down before grindelwald tina says she knows someone who might help newt and queenie make it into grindelwald's safe house where they try to act inconspicuous despite newt's social inadequacy grindelwald shows up and queenie whispers t newt that she can't read his thoughts newt notices a small metal vial on grindelwald's waist grindelwald speaks with them casually about his cause before asking his other followers to leave he then addresses newt by name and asks him about new york newt instinctively pulls out his wand but grindelwald casually disarms him saying they are fighting for the same thing and addressing queenie directly says that he wants harmony between the muggles and the wizards and freedom for them to marry who they like this gives queenie a more direct line of reasoning for her to change sides at the end queenie asks if they are free to leave to which grindelwald allows queenie to do so but asks newt to stay behind newt says he'll meet her at the safe house with jacob grindelwald asks newt what albus has been telling him with newt responding that he hasn't talked to dumbledore since hogwarts grindelwald chastises him for lying and asks him if he's comfortable being a puppet grindelwald's followers start to re enter the room when newt pulls out from his pocket the size changing dragon from the first film and manages to escape with help from his  credence and nagini are walking down the street when they are stopped by a wizard handing out cards credence flips the card over and the lettering transforms into an image of gellert grindelwald tina and yusuf investigate the orphanage where they find the dead woman with no marks on her searching through the orphanages registration records they find that credence was originally transferred over  years ago under an unknown name and taken abroad to new york the ministry including leta and newts brother arrive at the safe house on dumbledore's tip and arrest jacob and queenie for traveling across borders illegally before newt arrived back at the house after the incident with grindelwald leta demands to know where newt is to which queenie responds that he was last at grindelwald's hideout they demand they tell them the location after which they'll obliviate jacob which queenie begs them not to do they take them down to the french ministry for questioning where at the same time tina/yusuf arrive to review the records on credence credence and nagini travel to the location on grindelwald's card where he is greeted by none other than grindelwald who is threatened by credence for abandoning him in new york grindelwald apologizes saying that his lineage was destined for greatness credence demands to know where he came from which grindelwald said will be answered in due time if he listens to what he has to say grindelwald asks him to come to his rally later and his heart will tell him what's right he tells credence to wait for his sign then apparatus away newt is hiding from grindelwald's followers when he receives a letter from a mysterious owl saying that's he's needed in the ministry in paris and to bring help newt heads to the ministry pretending to be his brother theseus and manages to get in to the lower levels when he sees that queenie and jacob are being held for questioning his nifflers create a distraction while he manages to get them out when he runs into theseus the two duel and newt starts losing when leta arrives and surprisingly disarms theseus she tells newt they need to get out now tina is examining credence's records when she realizes that the date of credences adoption lines up with the disappearance of a pure blood wizard baby by the name of corvus lestrange just then she hears a commotion as newt has kept his case on him and used a shrinking charm to conceal it allowing him to use a thunderbird in order to fight off ministry officials tina grabs her wand and hurries downstairs to where newt is tina runs into newt as he's running with jacob and queenie toward the exit and she begrudgingly helps him by using her password to get to the ground level as they're all about to reach the exit however yusuf and the ministry guards cut them off and order their arrest on site the reunited group are all jailed in the dungeon below similar to the first one where tina and newt as well as jacob and queenie share emotional scenes yusuf comes down and demands to know where credence is from newt threatening to torture his friends which newt responds that he doesn't know tina tells him he knows credences real name is corvus lestrange queenie reads his mind and realizes he's working for grindelwald confronted by this yusuf orders their execution then leaves newt's bow truckle picks the lock and the gang manage to escape as leta overrides security and returns all their wands newt asks her if she ever had a brother which she responds she didn't want him to hate her for what she did queenie seems unable to read her mind either theseus joins them despite newt's protests saying that stopping grindelwald and finding credence is more important than keeping his job at the ministry leta says that she thinks she knows where credence is but they need to hurry in paris black ribbons cascade over the city only seen by wizards in the film to call grindelwald's followers to an undisclosed location newt with tina jacob leta queenie and theseus apparate in a graveyard leta explains that this is her family's tomb and that the lestrange name died with corvus we see another figure apparate into view credence accompanied by nagini they pull their wands out at him except newt who tries to explain to credence that they don't want to hurt him credence asks if any of them have the answers and if he's actually leta's long lost brother leta gives the same exposition about the switched babies as in the movie and tells credence she wished she knew more credence is hurt by this when suddenly a blue ring of fire appears as grindelwald is starting his speech to his followers tina realizes this was a set up to get them here and there is an apparition lock meaning they can't escape she puts together that leta had set them up and to the heartbreak of theseus leta was working for grindelwald which she also confesses to imploring the rest to just hear him out the begrudgingly start to listen to grindelwald as the ministry shows up to break up the rally with theseus joining them newt notices that vial and releases a niffler into the crowd the speech scene was done really well in the film the only thing i would change is the aftermath when grindelwald draws his flaming circle that kills people unloyal to him queenie and other would be enticed to join his side while tina thesues etc attempt to fight him off when grindelwald is winning and close to killing newt that should be when leta distracts him by offering to join him however she intentionally avoids the fire and duels grindelwald betraying him for her love for newt holding him off just long enough for newt and theseus to escape also instead of credence reluctantly joining grindelwald the fighting should cause his obscurus to come out resulting in the ministry fighting him then to hint at the twist a phoenix should come and help fight off the attackers grindelwald tells credence in his obscurus form to join him which credence does resulting in grindelwald leaving and our heroes except for queenie who joined grindelwald left alone and saddened after losing leta the niffler still gets the vial and we're still left on the same cliffhanger reveal of aurelius dumbledore only the movie behind it is much more focused overall the changes where mostly to the second act which relied on an onfocused low stakes plot with an often times non linear or unconnected narrative that only came together through coincidence as opposed to common themes or a better plot i tried to keep the main revelations the same while altering character motivations to be more believable/in character,   wa bad here' how i would'v chang it ok first off sorri if you like the movi but i thought it wa bad like almost incomprehens the plot wa a mess the reveal were meaningless

dumbledor onli the movi behind it is much more focus overal the chang where mostli to the second act which reli on an onfocus low stake plot with an often time non linear or unconnect narr that onli came togeth through coincid as oppos to common theme or a better plot i tri to keep the main revel the same while alter charact motiv to be more believable/in charact,"Fantastic Beasts 2 was bad. Here's how I would've changed it Ok first off, sorry if you liked the movie, but I thought it was bad. Like, almost incomprehensible. The plot was a mess, the reveals were meaningless, and even when the movie started to actually have focus it had been so boring and contrived that the set-up for the next one was exhausting to get through. J.K. Rowling clearly writes books and not movies, and that was apparent as the lack of focus or coherence can only be explained by an author who wants to have a myriad of storylines without the appropriate amount of time to cover them all. So much goes nowhere, and I think that could be easily fixed.  & #   First, the opening is fine. Good action, engaging, and easy to follow, gets the plot moving. I'd be fine keeping that the way it is. After that, it makes sense to follow Newt, who should be THE definitive main character, like in the last one. Establish his home life, and have him meet his brother and establish his engagement to Leta at the ministry. Drop the stupid ""Tina thinks Newt is marrying Leta subplot""  & #   The ministry scene can go down the way it did, only with way LESS exposition. Have Newt request to have his travel ban lifted, and establish that it's in order to go to New York to see Tina. That gives him and the audience clear set goals. Have the ministry offer Newt a job as a auror, the catch being that he needs to find and kill Creedence, as Newt is an expert on Obscurials. Instead of having Newt turn this down because of ""not wanting to pick sides"" have him turn it down because he's not a killer. And, instead of having the ministry hire some nameless goon to track him down, have it be Leta herself. This offers some major conflict for later on.  & #   Have Newt being tracked or whatever, and Dumbledore manages to get in contact with him anyway, and the scene with Newt and Albus should go similarly to the movie, except it should be Dumbledore, not the ministry, who tips off Newt that Credence is in Paris. This establishes that Dumbledore is one step ahead of them. Also, have Newt's change of heart come from the fact that Dumbledore wants Newt to rehabilitate Credence rather than killing him.  & #   When Queen and Jacob arrive at Newt's place, have it be for an actual reason, instead of having it be seemingly inconsequential. Drop the meaningless subplot with the love spell and instead have Queenie say that her and Jacob are getting married secretly in England. And then drop the bombshell: that Tina was tasked with tracking Grindelwald by the American ministry and is now missing. This further incentivizes Newt to engage in this mission, and he reveals to them that he has a lead as to where Grindelwald might be. Instead of it just being Jacob and Newt, Queenie should also be joining them in illegally traveling to Paris.  Meanwhile, in Paris, establish that Credence is looking for clues of his heritage, where he comes across the circus and sees Nagini, having him empathize with her. Have him meet with her after the show and have them establish a relationship, rather than having a relationship that the audience didn't see. Later you can have Creedence watching another performance, only when things do go wrong, have it be because Credence saw Nagini being abused and his obscurial came out, thus making his presence in Paris publicly known. When the French ministry does show up to investigate, have Tina be one of the aurors, working undercover for the American ministry.  Yusuf Kama, whose presence felt entirely forced in the movie, can be Tina's superior, and, due to Tina's knowledge of the obscurial, is visibly suspicious of her.  & #   Have Newt and co. arrive at Paris shortly after this happened, and have Newt do some magical creature nonsense to find out that Tina had been in Paris, and have them be able to track down the circus that Credence was at.  & #   The scene where the ministry arrives at Hogwarts and questions Dumbledore, as well as Leta's flashback was essential to establishing the plot point of the blood oath for the audience as well as giving Leta a bit more backstory, and should probably be kept, minus the nonsensical McGonagall cameo. The main change I would've made is to have Dumbledore intentionally reveal Newt's location to the ministry, and therefore have him set up the later events, as he has a habit for manipulating actions in order to reach an end goal.  & #   At this point, Grindelwald would've heard about the attack at the circus, and sends his followers to search for Credence there. Have them searching the circus at the same time as Newt and co., and have Queenie be able to read their minds and tell that they're working for Grindelwald. Using the magical beasts they subdue them and, with Queenie's legilimacy, are able to derive Grindelwald's location before aurors come to arrest the followers.  Tina is involved in arresting the followers and notices that the swooping evil was what had restrained them, and puts together that Newt is in Paris.  & #   Credence and Nagini still go to the orphanage where Credence grew up, and again they're left with more questions than answers. The only difference being that instead of Grindelwald's followers attacking, Credence is instead told that as a baby, he was transported by a young girl, rather than an adult. This ties into the mystery element that wasn't properly expunged upon in the movie. Also, if a scene needs to establish Grindelwald as a proper villain, have him learn about Credence searching for answers and order the murder of this woman/house elf hybrid later.  & #   Newt and co. are revealed to have stolen hairs off of the followers of Grindelwald, and, on Dumbledore's advice, head to the Paris safe house, which is the home of Nicolas Flamel. There, Flamel can have a similar scene as in the film, except this time he serves a purpose, which is to provide the trio with poly juice potion. Queenie and Newt drink the potion and disguise themselves as Grindelwald's followers to gain access to Grindelwald's hideout and hopefully learn of Credence's location, while Jacob stays with Flamel.  & #   Tina is working at the ministry of France, looking through Newt's records from the English ministry when she stumbles across Leta's file. She's about to read it when Yusuf calls her into his office and locks the door. Tina notices a strange mark on his arm when Yusuf asks her how long she had been working for Grindelwald. Tina denies this under the threat of death, before finally admitting to being an American spy on the case to find Credence Barebone. Yusuf smiles, telling her he gave her veretiserum earlier, and says that he trusts her and wants her to help him track him down before Grindelwald. Tina says she knows someone who might help.  & #   Newt and Queenie make it into Grindelwald's safe house, where they try to act inconspicuous despite Newt's social inadequacy. Grindelwald shows up, and Queenie whispers t Newt that she can't read his thoughts. Newt notices a small metal vial on Grindelwald's waist. Grindelwald speaks with them casually about his cause, before asking his other followers to leave. He then addresses Newt by name, and asks him about New York. Newt instinctively pulls out his wand but Grindelwald casually disarms him, saying they are fighting for the same thing, and, addressing Queenie directly, says that he wants harmony between the muggles and the wizards, and freedom for them to marry who they like. This gives Queenie a more direct line of reasoning for her to change sides at the end. Queenie asks if they are free to leave, to which Grindelwald allows Queenie to do so, but asks Newt to stay behind. Newt says he'll meet her at the safe house with Jacob. Grindelwald asks Newt what Albus has been telling him, with Newt responding that he hasn't talked to Dumbledore since Hogwarts. Grindelwald chastises him for lying, and asks him if he's comfortable being a puppet. Grindelwald's followers start to re-enter the room, when Newt pulls out from his pocket the size changing dragon from the first film and manages to escape with help from his beasts.  & #   Credence and Nagini are walking down the street when they are stopped by a wizard handing out cards. Credence flips the card over and the lettering transforms into an image of Gellert Grindelwald.  & #   Tina and Yusuf investigate the orphanage where they find the dead woman with no marks on her. Searching through the orphanages registration records, they find that Credence was originally transferred over 20 years ago under an unknown name, and taken abroad to New York.  & #   The ministry, including Leta and Newts brother, arrive at the safe house on Dumbledore's tip and arrest Jacob and Queenie for traveling across borders illegally, before Newt arrived back at the house after the incident with Grindelwald. Leta demands to know where Newt is, to which Queenie responds that he was last at Grindelwald's hideout. They demand they tell them the location, after which they'll obliviate Jacob, which Queenie begs them not to do. They take them down to the French ministry for questioning, where at the same time Tina/Yusuf arrive to review the records on Credence.  & #   Credence and Nagini travel to the location on Grindelwald's card, where he is greeted by none other than Grindelwald, who is threatened by Credence for abandoning him in New York. Grindelwald apologizes, saying that his lineage was destined for greatness. Credence demands to know where he came from, which Grindelwald said will be answered in due time, if he listens to what he has to say. Grindelwald asks him to come to his rally later, and his heart will tell him what's right. He tells Credence to wait for his sign, then apparatus away.  & #   Newt is hiding from Grindelwald's followers when he receives a letter from a mysterious owl saying that's he's needed in the ministry in Paris and to bring help. Newt heads to the ministry, pretending to be his brother Theseus, and manages to get in to the lower levels when he sees that Queenie and Jacob are being held for questioning. His nifflers create a distraction while he manages to get them out, when he runs into Theseus. The two duel, and Newt starts losing when Leta arrives, and surprisingly disarms Theseus. She tells Newt they need to get out now. Tina is examining Credence's records when she realizes that the date of Credences adoption lines up with the disappearance of a pure blood wizard baby by the name of Corvus Lestrange. Just then she hears a commotion, as Newt has kept his case on him and used a shrinking charm to conceal it, allowing him to use a thunderbird in order to fight off ministry officials. Tina grabs her wand and hurries downstairs to where Newt is. Tina runs into Newt as he's running with Jacob and Queenie toward the exit, and she begrudgingly helps him by using her password to get to the ground level. As they're all about to reach the exit, however, Yusuf and the ministry guards cut them off and order their arrest on site. The reunited group are all jailed in the dungeon below, similar to the first one, where Tina and Newt, as well as Jacob and Queenie, share emotional scenes. Yusuf comes down and demands to know where Credence is from Newt, threatening to torture his friends, which newt responds that he doesn't know. Tina tells him he knows Credences real name is Corvus Lestrange. Queenie reads his mind and realizes he's working for Grindelwald. Confronted by this, Yusuf orders their execution then leaves. Newt's bow truckle picks the lock and the gang manage to escape as Leta overrides security and returns all their wands. Newt asks her if she ever had a brother, which she responds she didn't want him to hate her for what she did. Queenie seems. unable to read her mind either. Theseus joins them, despite Newt's protests, saying that stopping Grindelwald and finding Credence is more important than keeping his job at the ministry. Leta says that she thinks she knows where Credence is, but they need to hurry.  & #   In Paris, black ribbons cascade over the city only seen by wizards in the film to call Grindelwald's followers to an undisclosed location.  & #   Newt, with Tina, Jacob, Leta, Queenie, and Theseus, apparate in a graveyard. Leta explains that this is her family's tomb, and that, the Lestrange name died with Corvus. We see another figure apparate into view, Credence, accompanied by Nagini. They pull their wands out at him except Newt, who tries to explain to Credence that they don't want to hurt him. Credence asks if any of them have the answers, and if he's actually Leta's long lost brother. Leta gives the same exposition about the switched babies as in the movie, and tells Credence she wished she knew more. Credence is hurt by this, when suddenly a blue ring of fire appears, as Grindelwald is starting his speech to his followers. Tina realizes this was a set up to get them here, and there is an apparition lock, meaning they can't escape. She puts together that Leta had set them up, and to the heartbreak of Theseus, Leta was working for Grindelwald, which she also confesses to, imploring the rest to just hear him out.  & #   The begrudgingly start to listen to Grindelwald as the ministry shows up to break up the rally, with Theseus joining them. Newt notices that vial and releases a niffler into the crowd. The speech scene was done really well in the film, the only thing I would change is the aftermath.  & #   When Grindelwald draws his flaming circle that kills people unloyal to him, Queenie and other would be enticed to join his side while Tina, Thesues etc. attempt to fight him off. When Grindelwald is winning, and close to killing Newt, that should be when Leta distracts him by offering to join him, however she intentionally avoids the fire  and duels Grindelwald, betraying him for her love for Newt, holding him off just long enough for Newt and Theseus to escape. Also, instead of Credence reluctantly joining Grindelwald, the fighting should cause his Obscurus to come out, resulting in the ministry fighting him. Then, to hint at the twist, a phoenix should come and help fight off the attackers. Grindelwald tells Credence, in his Obscurus form, to join him, which Credence does, resulting in Grindelwald leaving and our heroes, except for Queenie who joined Grindelwald, left alone and saddened after losing Leta. The niffler still gets the vial, and we're still left on the same cliffhanger reveal of Aurelius Dumbledore, only the movie behind it is much more focused.  & #   Overall the changes where mostly to the second act which relied on an onfocused low stakes plot with an often times non-linear or unconnected narrative that only came together through coincidence as opposed to common themes or a better plot. I tried to keep the main revelations the same while altering character motivations to be more believable/in character.  & #   & #   & #"

Too many plotlines, too many characters, too many POVs and way too less time is what would happen when you do this.  But the ironic thing is that this is coming from the same people who want full feature movies with every detail of what happened in the potter series. Like, if harry was only a movie series and they had given more time to kreacher in the ootp, more than half the theatre would have left saying it was unneccesary inclusion in the movie even though his role in the series is of paramount importance later.  So, all I'm trying to say is that we wanted novel like movies and we got them. Five of them. Full with different plot lines and character threads for each person. I think it'll all make sense in the end. Just have a little faith in Jo and believe that she knows what she's doing.  After all, she is the same person who wrote the potter series in the first place."
2241,things i'd love to see in   land so my bf and i went to the wizarding world of   at ush recently and we spent the drive home contemplating things we would like to see in the future i realize there are a billion logistical issues for why certain things can't happen such as space wait time etc but anyway  a sorting ceremony in the three broomsticks i know it would break canon as the sorting ceremony happens in the great hall but anyway wouldn't it be a fun attraction if as you are eating your bangers and mash you watch people getting sorted into houses it'd be even better if the hat was a puppet and the person placing the hat on your head was a rad ventriloquist then you'd be able to whisper house that you want a la' movie  and sort of choose your own house in the way that  did rather than it being totally random like the hat that you can buy and try on in filch's emporium of course that would be a somewhat secret that you would need to know prior to being sorted otherwise the hat would just shout out a random house certainly it would be hard for the person holding the hat to hear you and there's already not enough room in the three broomsticks for people to eat a rush

fun especially if you and your crew get wands at the beginning of the maze that act like laser tag guns there could be blast ended skrewts and scary things that boggarts would turn into dementors

1520,what do you think of the marauders i believe the marauders may be some of the most popular characters in the   universe maybe even more than the trio what do you think of them though we only see one chapter of them yet it has spawned reams of fan fiction and countless web pages of fan art i think they are a fun addition but honestly i don t like them that much for starter i admit they were flawed but ultimately good kids except wormtail that being said i don t think they have anything in common with the golden trio apart from sneaking around they aren t and weren t kind like the golden trio and have a haughtiness and self regard that fred and george fellow mischief makers lacked honestly if the trio and marauders went to school i m not sure they d be friends together including  and james funnily enough of all the marauders i like james the least he honestly strikes me as a kid who has had pretty much born good at everything and never really had to struggle to get what he wanted ever i liked sirius a lot more sure he s got a vis iou s streak but it sort of makes sense coming from the family he comes from like he is one of the good guys but still had something of his family s violent streak luring snape to the werewolf trying to kill peter remus is fine but a bit flaky i m sorry he s a werewolf but i sort of thought he used that as a crutch/ excuse to leave tonks and his child to be i don t see how you can be friends with two notorious trouble makers and not be implicated himself he probably got into trouble with james and siri both just not as much wormtail is well wormtail this isn t to say i like snape i thought he was kind of wierd and unpleasant and the whole obsession/ generation of lily was kind of unhealthy even if he was bullied by james it s not like he was filled with joy and good will out to make the world a better place idk i liked him more before the whole he loved lily all along thing was revealed it didn t seem so extraordinarily that a sort of mean unpleasant person would be committed to doing the eighth thing when push came to shove,what do you think of the maraud i believ the maraud may be some of the most popular charact in the   univers mayb even more than the trio what do you think of them though we onli see one chapter of them yet it ha spawn ream of fan fiction and countless web page of fan art i think they are a fun addit but honestli i don t like them that much for starter i admit they were flaw but ultim good kid except wormtail that be said i don t think they have anyth in common with the golden trio apart from sneak around they aren t and weren t kind like the golden trio and have a haughti and self regard that fred and georg fellow mischief maker lack honestli if the trio and maraud went to school i m not sure they d be friend togeth includ  and jame funnili enough of all the maraud i like jame the least he honestli strike me as a kid who ha had pretti much born good at everyth and never realli had to struggl to get what he want ever i like siriu a lot more sure he s got a vi iou s streak but it sort of make sens come from the famili he come from like he is one of the good guy but still had someth of hi famili s violent streak lure snape to the werewolf tri to kill peter remu is fine but a bit flaki i m sorri he s a werewolf but i sort of thought he use that as a crutch/ excus to leav tonk and

you think of them though we onli see one chapter of them yet it ha spawn ream of fan fiction and countless web page of fan art i think they are a fun addit but honestli i don t like them that much for starter i admit they were flaw but ultim good kid except wormtail that be said i don t think they have anyth in common with the golden trio apart from sneak around they aren t and weren t kind like the golden trio and have a haughti and self regard that fred and georg fellow mischief maker lack honestli if the trio and maraud went to school i m not sure they d be friend togeth includ  and jame funnili enough of all the maraud i like jame the least he honestli strike me as a kid who ha had pretti much born good at everyth and never realli had to struggl to get what he want ever i like siriu a lot more sure he s got a vi iou s streak but it sort of make sens come from the famili he come from like he is one of the good guy but still had someth of hi famili s violent streak lure snape to the werewolf tri to kill peter remu is fine but a bit flaki i m sorri he s a werewolf but i sort of thought he use that as a crutch/ excus to leav tonk and hi child to be i don t see how you can be

came to shove,"What do you think of the Marauders? I believe the Marauders may be some of the most popular characters in the Harry Potter universe.  Maybe even more than the trio. What do you think of them though?  We only see one chapter of them yet it has spawned reams of fan fiction and countless web pages of fan art.  I think they are a fun addition, but honestly I don’t like them that much.  For starter, I admit they were flawed but ultimately “good” kids ( except Wormtail).  That being said I don’t think they have anything in common with the golden trio ( apart from sneaking around.) They aren’t and weren’t kind like the golden trio and have a haughtiness and self regard that Fred and George ( fellow mischief makers) lacked.  Honestly if the trio and Marauders went to school I’m not sure they’d be friends together ( including Harry and James).  Funnily enough of all the Marauders I like James the least.  He honestly strikes me as a kid who has had pretty much born good at everything and never really had to struggle to get what he wanted ever.  I liked Sirius a lot more. Sure he’s got a Vis IOU’s streak but it sort of makes sense coming from the family he comes from. Like he is one of the good guys but still had something of his family’s violent streak ( luring Snape to the werewolf, trying to kill Peter)  Remus is fine, but a bit flaky. I’m sorry he’s a werewolf, but I sort of thought he used that as a crutch/ excuse to leave Tonks and his child to be. I don’t see how you can be friends with two notorious trouble makers and not be implicated himself. He probably got into trouble with James and Siri both, just not as much.  Wormtail is well, Wormtail 🐀.  This isn’t to say I like Snape. I thought he was kind of wierd and unpleasant, and the whole obsession/ generation of Lily was kind of unhealthy. Even if he was bullied by James it’s not like he was filled with joy and good will, out to make the world a better place. Idk I liked him more before the whole “he loved Lily all along thing “ was revealed. It didn’t seem so extraordinarily that a sort of mean, unpleasant person would be committed to doing the eighth thing when push came to shove"

I didn't go in having any expectations and I was delighted with the result.   I noticed something that stood out to me and I thought others who are far smarter than I in these matters would be able to answer my question.  [Spoilers Ahead!]  [My observation came to when Grinddelwald was revealed at the end. I noticed, as others have, that he was not using the Elder Wand. I believe we all can agree that he did possess the Wand as it showed him taking it as a youth in the Deathly Hallows.](/spoiler)  [What interested me was that Tina disarmed him before he was captured. Wouldn't the rules of possession of the Elder Wand, as stated in the Deathly Hallows, say that Tina became the master of the Wand after disarming its master? We see this happen when Draco disarms Dumbledore in The Halfblood Prince and again when Harry rips a generic Wand from Draco's hand in the Deathly Hallows. By this reasoning, since Tina disarmed Grindlewald, even from a normal wand, the Elder Wand would have given its allegiance to Tina.](/spoiler)  [So either this is a large inconsistency in the plot or it is intended which means Grindlewald would need to defeat Tina at a later time.](/spoiler)  Thoughts?

Oooookay, nobody asked for this, but what's wrong with giving this minor character a backstory all the same? Why *not* flesh her out, whether the fans demanded it or not?  I don't get that line of thinking. Were people really this attached to the idea of Nagini as just a plain, simple snake, or did the Harry Potter fandom suddenly start to dislike giving more focus and detail to side characters? Or is it just because this is yet another subplot in a movie that has too much going on already?"

At moments he was actually quite mean for example in the Deathly hollows when he screamed at Ron to leave. He just wasn't a nice guy in my eyes he was a bit selfish even since he wanted to win the war all by himself. But when you read the books or watch the movies you feel like he is the hero who fullfilled his prophecy. I guess that's why they say that ""everyone is a hero of their own story"""

It is what it is and there are more important things in life to focus  People are mentioning that McGonagall shouldn’t have been at Hogwarts in 1927, but she was also there when Leta and Newt were students which would be in the 19-teens. In those flashbacks she appears to be, and this would make sense for the profession, in her mid-to-late twenties, which would place her birth around 1890. This makes her nearly 50 years older than we were led to believe from JK Rowling’s backstory of her on Pottermore. It also means she is over 100 years old when Harry goes to Hogwarts.  I understand that magical folk live longer with an average life expectancy around 115 years, but to change this detail of her doesn’t just change our perception of her age, but it does change her life experiences.  In the backstory we were given she is born in 1935 which means she would have been a little kid during World War II. But now she was actually an adult for World War I, which we hear impacted the wizarding world too.  I saw somewhere that she was a student while Dumbledore was transfiguration teacher, but clearly now that is not possible. In fact, it becomes less likely she was a student while Dumbledore was a teacher at all given how close they are in age.  This also means that when she is Headmistress during the Cursed Child she is close to 130 years old.   Overall, this really doesn’t matter, especially to casual viewers, but to those of us who enjoy the details it makes it a little frustrating and slightly more difficult to suspend our disbelief."

They had the audience vote beforehand to have “correct” answers.  Here is the link: [video](https://youtu.be/gtPqBgH0xY0)  Do you agree with the results?  The people voted: Ironman - Ravenclaw Captain America - Gryffindor Thor - Gryffindor Hawkeye - Hufflepuff Spider-Man - Hufflepuff Nebula - Slytherin Groot - Hufflepuff Nick Fury - Slytherin Captain Marvel - Gryffindor Scarlet Witch - Ravenclaw Shuri - Ravenclaw Loki - Slytherin  Personally, I mostly agree. I would see Ironman in Slytherin, because he is definitely cunning and ambitious. Thor I would put into Hufflepuff - he is so loyal to Loki, even after everything that happened. Same with Nebula, she does everything she does out of loyalty to either Thanos or Gamora. And Scarlet Witch - no idea where to put her. Not Ravenclaw though. And not Hufflepuff either.  What do you think?"

This is a theory that just came to me the other day (I haven’t seen it elsewhere yet).   So we know that Dumbledore put off facing Grindelwald for a long time because he was afraid of finding out the truth of who killed Arianna. How would facing Grindelwald uncover the truth of that moment? Did Dumbledore think Grindelwald had a better memory than himself? I don’t think so. I think the answer lies in the Elder Wand. Here is where the speculation comes in.   What if Arianna, through her misbehaving obscurus, got her hands on the Elder wand by defeating its previous owner? And Gellert and Albus knew this? What if the fight that broke out between them and Aberforth was over defeating or even killing Arianna to claim ownership of it? And in the heat of the battle someone did kill her and then, seizing the moment, Gellert grabbed the wand and ran.   Now I know what you’re thinking. If Albus was the one that killed Arianna then the Elder wand wouldn’t have worked for Gellert all these years. But this is where the blood pact comes in. I think the blood pact is allowing the Elder wand to work for both of them. That’s why it isn’t resisting him like Voldemort. However, I think Albus knows that in a duel the Elder wand would not kill him and reveal that he was the one who killed Arianna and is the rightful owner of the wand."

Some teachers like Sprout give out 10 points per easy question answered so assuming Hermione is not the only nerd at school the point totals should be in the  thousands at least. With so many students and so many classes having them below 500 just doesn't make sense."

A small number of thoughts I had listening to the Deathly Hallows for the umpteenth time.  Curious for opinions.  1. In Deathly Hallows we learn about 'taboo'. What the deatheaters do to you know who's name after taking the ministry. A word/phrase gets cursed. Uttering said word/phrase will break protective enchantments and create a magical disturbance, making the speaker trackable.  WHY didn't the ministry taboo the unforgivable curses? Criminals would be easier to catch, no?  2. DH again: Why do I read people saying on so many places that you know who flying adds nothing... ?  It's made clear to the readers later on how significant this is. Olivander says: ""yes, if you are any wizard at all you can channel you powers through almost any instrument. The best results however must always be achieved where there is the best affinity between wizard and wand"".  Making clear that 1. You don't ""need"" an instrument. 2. You Know Who flying without enchanted broomstick is immeasurably harder and thus attesting to his prowess. Which is why everyone is surprised.   Needed a place to dump my thoughts, Thanks for listening to my TedxTalk."

It has been more than 20 years since the first book of the series has been published, but it still has not lost its topicality. Furthermore, it continues to be so popular that the author continues to extend Harry Potter world with movies like “[Fantastic Beasts and where to find them”.](https://www.pottermore.com/fantastic-beasts)Along with the younger Potterheads, Harry Potter series have attracted a wide adult audience as well.

3435,dumbledore's ancestry so one of the themes in original series is that it doesn't matter where you come from you can be very well muggle born and still achieve great things it's also important that voldemort embrace his heritage as descendant of legendary wizard and dismiss his non magical roots he even value things of legendary ancestry as more powerful and worthy like with his horcruxes it works well for most of time but in the seventh book we learn that  is also descendant of powerful ancient wizarding family perevells so ultimately despite the overall theme we have chosen one destined to defeat evil wizard it still works in some way because we have all those other characters that don't need ancient heritage to stand their own and the other themes include friendship cooperation he wouldn't done it all by himself anyway and then it turns out that the other most important person in defeating voldemort who also was the one to defeat the other world threatening evil wizard also comes from mighty family which even has it's own legends that also turn out to be true and they're basically associated with one of most powerful magical creatures he also has far less flaws that  he usually doesn't need any help it and when he ask for it it's because he himself found that it's the way to go and designed whole plan for others to follow he knew that  will eventually defeat voldemort and is the only one who can dumbledore is all powerful but he also happens to be part of family where everyone can get pet phoenix is there another family with such a strong trait perhaps the most close one is  that are able to pass down valuable heirloom for generations that is also very strong magic item and has actual usage so is dumbledore such a might wizard because he is wise patient or caring or because he is just dumbledore doesn't it totally undermine what rowling achieved with hermione and the likes do this story need characters like this it certainly doesn't need

that it doesn't matter where you come from. You can be very well Muggle-born and still achieve great things. It's also important that Voldemort embrace his heritage as descendant of legendary wizard and dismiss his non-magical roots. He even value things of legendary ancestry as more powerful and worthy, like with his Horcruxes. It works well for most of time, but in the seventh book we learn that Harry is also descendant of powerful, ancient wizarding family (Perevells). So ultimately, despite the overall theme, we have chosen one destined to defeat evil wizard. It still works in some way because we have all those other characters that don't need ancient heritage to stand their own and the other themes include friendship, cooperation, he wouldn't done it all by himself anyway.  And then it turns out that the other most important person in defeating Voldemort, who also was the one to defeat the other world-threatening evil wizard, also comes from mighty family which even has it's own legends that also turn out to be true and they're basically associated with one of most powerful magical creatures. He also has far less flaws that Harry, he usually doesn't need any help it and when he ask for it it's because he himself found that it's the way to go and designed whole plan for others to follow (he knew that Harry will eventually defeat Voldemort and is the only one who can). Dumbledore is all powerful but he also happens to be part of family where everyone can get pet phoenix. Is there another family with such a strong trait? Perhaps the most close one is Perevells/Potter that are able to pass down valuable heirloom for generations that is also very strong magic item and has actual usage. So is Dumbledore such a might wizard because he is wise, patient, or caring or because he is just Dumbledore?  Doesn't it totally undermine what Rowling achieved with Hermione and the likes? Do this story need characters like this? It certainly doesn't need forced plot-twist that are connecting everything for the sake of suprise and fan service."

The one talked about plot of CoG has been that the Elder Wand should have resisted Grindelwald because it supposedly belongs to Tina since she summoned the wand at the end of the first film.  In my opinion, this isn't a plot hole at all. And I think there are two reasons for it.  First, at the end of the first film, Grindelwald wasn't disarmed. By anyone. He simply dropped his wand. Here is an excerpt from the script:  &gt;  Out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around Graves like a whip. Graves tries to hold it off as it tightens, but staggers, struggles, and falls to his knees, dropping his wand. &gt;  &gt; TINA  &gt; *Accio.*  And second, Tina merely summoned the wand. She doesn't disarm Grindelwald with the Expelliarmus spell, which we know transfers the allegiance of a wand to the caster of the spell.  It's been some years since I read the books and I'm not that knowledgeable on Potter lore, but I don't think simply summoning a wand makes you its master.  The movie did have its flaws, sure, but I don't think this was one of them.  What are your thoughts?"

I know there are many more inconsistencies throughout the film but something as big as this really makes me question how much thought was put into the story.   I am even put off from reading fan theories as i fear more thought is put into those than the actual film.  It feels like somewhere a dice is being rolled to come up with things like ""OOOH lets give Albus an extra brother no one knew about"" -.-  I am mostly mad at how HUGE the potential was to develop all the characters we know and grew up with and expand on the wizarding universe and how much they FUCKED IT UP"

SPOILER ALERT !  First post here. I’m french so feel free to make fun of me for my writing (or anything else).  I’d like to submit an Harry Potter theory to your attention. After watching Fantastic Beasts 2, I tried to understand how Aurelius could be related to Albus Dumbledore. My theory is quite dark so brace yourselves.  I do not believe Aurelius is Kendra Dumbledore’s son though it would be « almost possible » according to the dates : Kendra dies in november 1899, Credence/Aurelius was born « circa 1901 » from what I gathered. But Kendra, assuming she took her hubsband’s name, would not be a true Dumbledore, would she ?  Therefore, I came up with quite a dreadful theory : what if Ariana was raped by Grindelwald ? Aurelius would be a true Dumbledore. Plus, il would explain why Credence was able to master his Obscurus : he would be the very first biological heir of a previous Obscurus and this side of him would be « natural ». It would also explain why he is so powerful : biological heir of Dumbledore AND Grindelwald.  Finally, it could explain the dispute between Albus Dumbledore and Grindelwald and why the dark wizard fled Godric’s Hollow. It would also explain why Grindelwald knows so much about Credence. In the movie, I do believe he says to Credence that Albus is his brother, but let’s face it : would he really say « hey, dude ! By the way, I’m your father because I raped your mother when she was 12 » ? That wouldn’t serve his purpose (killing Dumbledore) really well now, would it ?  What do you think ?"

I didn't like it at first, but now it's an obsession. I've got several theories.  I've been told that JKR confirmed that AD and GG were gays, but what I see is something different. I put the blame on the presence of Flamel and some light reading on alchemy, one of my favourite subjects. I know that this is entertainment, but it can be more, and my theory is that it is more. That the audience is reading it 'too literal'. One doesn't play with the figure of Nicholas Flamel in vain.   What I've seen is that AD and GG have very similar personalities, and both oppose Scamander's. Fascinating triangle.   GG is the grand deceiver. I liked very much how he's written as the great manipulator. How he was when played by Colin Farrell and then by Depp. Both did a great job.  AD manipulates too, but softer. He's the guy who always knows what the other person needs to hear, that he admires Newt because bla bla, and Leta, and Theseus. He's also a player. It's just that he's more subtle than GG. He doesn't risk that much.  Scamander, on the other hand, has an amazing talent to connect with all. That's why he's so good with beasts. He persuades. I adore the scene in which he seduces the Chinese dragon. Must say that I've never liked the actor before. He's done an amazing job here.   Perhaps GG and AD are gays, but to me it goes beyond, it reaches their  nature and greed and ambition and power. They both have the same power, but play it differently.   Am I the only one seeing symbolism in the characters, in sentences, ideas blah blah?   Is there much different in the books?"

Okay this is something that has bugged me since I had read the last book and was wondering if anyone has insights to this. When Harry visits Snape's memories in the pensieve during DH, Dumbledore asks Snape to tell him that Harry is a Horcrux and should sacrifice himself because he knows that at that time Harry would have planned things so that it truly does mean the end of Voldemort. Assuming Dumbledore thought that Harry would have destroyed all the Horcuxes at that point and would survive the Voldemort's curse because of the blood connection, how did he think Harry would surely defeat Voldemort in a one to one duel? We know that the reason Harry ultimately defeated him was because he came to be the owner of the Elder wand in fortuitous circumstances, but Dumbledore had intended the ownership of the Elder wand to die with him. How was he so sure that Harry would then defeat even a Horcrux less Voldemort?"

Maybe we could begin to see a Dumbledore who doesn't believe in that early in the series and see him develope in that way latter on.  I think that he just really liked Newt and maybe he new it was Leta's fault and Newt convinces him to not rant her out. (Talking about Newt's expulsion, we know it was caused by endangering student's lives, but was really caused by Leta)  I am hoping to see this because it is a huge part of Dumbledore's phylosophy and I am curious to know who will make him think that way (or to better put that: who will deserve a second chance but not get one and how will Dumbledore know about that).  Could it be Grindelwald?  In DH Dumbledore says Grindelwald has felt remorce for what he has done.  Could he have started to fell that earlier but had gone to far to turn back?  It could be Credence who it seems will go with Grindelwald and join the enemy.  But deep down he is a suffering boy who doesn't know who he trully is nor where he comes from."

Here's a witch who'd fight for what she believes is right and go on unapproved adventures because she doesn't want a desk job, just like Newt. I think from the moment Tina dejectedly lead Newt from the auror's place to her less exciting and quite stale Wand Permit Office (full of desks), he felt at least a sense of empathy or understanding for her position. They weren't immediately friends but I think that connection was at least there.  Kudos really to J. K. Rowling."

Gryffindor? Please Read first &lt;3 It’s obvious that we’ve come to terms with the fact that Slytherins are misunderstood and falsely ridiculed people. I have done extensive (and a bit unnecessary ) amounts of research and have come to one conclusion.   I am a total Slytherin.  Everything i’ve watched and read about slytherins and what traits they tend to posses match up with mine.   I don’t quite feel like explaining my entire personality to you but here is an example.  I’m never a straight forward person. I admire the way of thoughtfully planning your actions (even though i sometimes forget to) and it just appears idiotic to me to just throw yourself into something and get unjustly praised for it. That only proves you have the luck of a fool.  I have mixed morals. They are all over the place accustomed to my beliefs only.  The dilemma is however, that i feel like a Harry.   Correct me if i’m wrong, but we all have traits that apply to each house. It is what person we choose and wish to be that really determines our house. Gryffindors are typically people that want to be brave and want have a gryffindor spirit.   It’s not like i’m nothing like a gryffindor and i’m just hungry for the clout of being one. But what we value is what makes our house (just like the founders). Ultimately, the will to put others before yourself is what i prize most in a persons character.  Finally all the trolls that are going to comment “take the test!1!1!1” I already have. 1000 times. The full test with all the questions available on pottermore have me gryffindor.   i’m starting to realize that tests are supposed to lead you in the right direction, but my fear of heights isn’t going to determine nor give me an accurate representation of my house.  P.S. i’m not here to ask you to tell me what house i’m in. (Although feel free) I just need someone to tell me whether it’s right to identify as a gryffindor for reasons that are just, even though my personality and values match slytherin????  I feel like if i’m in gryffindor i won’t be true to myself now that i know what slytherins are like and how i fit in SO much, a little too much. But i feel like in slytherin i won’t be comfortable with the whole “strive through with a one-minded system that will lead you to greatness”   Gryffindor is what i value and admire, but slytherin is who i am personality wise"

Part 1] Favorite Character Survey! Hi everyone,  I posted earlier this week with a survey asking for this sub's favorite character from the Harry Potter series (If you haven't voted, feel free to do so [here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0U10qPVmdm3cU8JZOUWl3tgqOWz71Br3SxLgTe5Se1IB5Fw/viewform?usp=sf_link)). After giving it a few days, the responses have stopped coming in, so I am now sharing the results!  I received **42 responses** representing **17** unique answers. For now, it's a good start and there are some interesting trends early on, but I'd love to gather even more.  I compiled all of the results into the following [graphs](https://imgur.com/a/yA3xiUi) which you I are clear enough to flip through. If you're interested, the data was organized onto the graphs after being transferred from the voting form to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TquhGIZc1HJFdSpT0E9wjpEvcE3XhO1KyR9Bsr64RGw/edit?usp=sharing).  With the amount of votes received having such a variety of responses (we could barely go 2 votes before getting another new character named), the list quickly sorts itself out into tiers.   So far we get the following:  Character | # Votes | Gryffindor | Hufflepuff | Ravenclaw | Slytherin ---------|-------|----------|----------|---------|--------- Sirius Black | 6 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 Hermione Granger | 5 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 Luna Lovegood | 5 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 0 Ginny Weasley | 4 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 Ron Weasley | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 Remus Lupin | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0  before any form of pattern fades away with the less-popular characters (so far!).  **Interesting Findings**  * Ravenclaw leads the houses with 17 votes (G:12, H:8, S:5).  * Hermione has received 0 votes from her own house, but finds herself in 2nd place due to strong support from Ravenclaw (and Hufflepuff!).  * Sirius Black is the only character with votes from every house.  * Severus Snape's two votes are both from Slytherins, while Harry Potter's two come from Gryffindor.  * 0 respondents listed themselves as unsorted.  Thanks for voting and for reading! If more responses come in, I will update the graphs/spreadsheets and report back with some hopefully more clear trends."

I am both a major Harry Potter and tabletop campaign fan, and I have been posting tabletop campaigns on my YouTube channel for the past 6 years (including a recent Pokemon tabletop campaign) . This year's campaign is a Wizarding World of Harry Potter campaign that focuses on what the Wizarding World is like internationally outside of Hogwarts and Ilvermorny. We wish to increase the representation and diversity of characters in this universe by exploring life in Mahoutokoro (Japan), Castelobruxo (Brazil), Uagadou (Africa), Koldovstoretz (Russia), and more!  It will be divided into 2 Acts : (a) while characters are still students in school (b) while they are full grown adults in the Wizarding World. We hope it will be interesting to watch these characters grow and evolve from children to adults, when they may be more focused on their careers, families, etc.  The viewers auditioned to participate, and the top candidates were interviewed so viewers could ""vote"" on their favorites to be a part of the campaign.

Mostly everyone accepts that he *becomes* a good person eventually, but I believe that Draco was *always* a good person and that he just always made the wrong choices. Draco Malfoy was child with almost no self-identity -- it was all drowned out by this father at a young age. He was an impressionable child and his father taught him all of the wrong things and all of the wrong behaviors. It took him almost 18 years to figure out that he had been brainwashed by his father into doing bad things.  Draco had the worst father figure in the series; I'd say Lucius Malfoy was even worse than Uncle Vernon. Lucius Malfoy makes Uncle Vernon look like fucking Santa Claus."
3561,the mirror of erised and why what dumbledore saw sticks to the canon a lot of people are complaining about the fact that the mirror of erised isn't used correctly in this movie because it's showing the past i disagree i think that while it is showing the past it's also showing dumbledores deepest desire although he loved grindlewald he knows he has to be the one to take him down and knowing dumbledore he's probably feeling very guilty about everything happening and how he can't stop it what he wants more than anything at that time is to have not made the blood pact while obviously the mirror shows him making the pact i think this was possibly just an easier way to portray the thought to the big screen not much more to back this up than just a gut feeling/reaction to what i saw curious to know if anyone else felt this way,the mirror of eris and whi what dumbledor saw stick to the canon a lot of peopl are complain about the fact that the mirror of eris isn't use correctli in thi movi becaus it' show the past i disagre i think that while it is show the past it' also show dumbledor deepest desir although he love grindlewald he know he ha to be the one to take him down and know dumbledor he' probabl feel veri guilti about everyth happen and how he can't stop it what he want more than anyth at that time is to have not made the blood pact while obvious the mirror show him make the pact i think thi wa possibl just an easier way to portray the thought to the big screen not much more to back thi up than just a gut feeling/react to what i saw curiou to know if anyon els felt thi way,the mirror of eris and whi what dumbledor saw stick to the canon a lot of peopl are complain about the fact that the mirror of eris isn't use correctli in thi movi becaus it' show the past i disagre i think that while it is show the past it' also show dumbledor deepest desir although he love grindlewald he know he ha to be the one to take him down and know dumbledor he' probabl feel veri guilti about everyth happen and how he can't stop it what he want more than anyth at that time is to have not made the blood pact while obvious the mirror show him make the pact i think thi wa possibl just an easier way to portray the thought to the big screen not much more to back thi up than just a gut feeling/react to what i saw curiou to know if anyon els felt thi way,"The mirror of Erised and why what Dumbledore saw sticks to the canon A lot of people are complaining about the fact that the mirror of Erised isn't used correctly in this movie because it's showing the past. I disagree. I think that, while it is showing the past, it's also showing dumbledores deepest desire. Although he loved grindlewald, he knows he has to be the one to take him down and knowing Dumbledore, he's probably feeling very guilty about everything happening and how he can't stop it. What he wants more than anything at that time is to have not made the blood pact. While obviously the mirror shows him making the pact, I think this was possibly just an easier way to portray the thought to the big screen. Not much more to back this up than just a gut feeling/reaction to what I saw. Curious to know if anyone else felt this way!"

I think how young they all were is important storywise.  It's always much more of a gut punch to me when I remember that Lily and James were just 21 at the time of their death.  They seemed so adult when I first read it, but rereading it now they seem so much tragically younger."
3922,the obscurus in the suitcase the truth theory spoiler hi there before we start this i have to make a confession i already made a theory on tumblr on the obscurus and where newt could have gotten it from and completely messed it up concerning the timeline it s deleted now today i m trying again because i m still convinced that we haven t been told the truth about this parasite in newt s suitcase so enjoy ___________________________________________ information so far when we are introduced to the obscurus in the movie we are told it s a parasite that is created when a young wizard or witch surpresses his magical powers it feeds on the powers but when it becomes too strong or when the wizard experiences strong negative emotions it breaks out becomes one with the wizard causes destruction around or kills it s host _______________________________________________________ newt s obscurus in the movie newt claims to have managed to seperate the obscurus from it s host a young girl in sudan yet when he tells the story to credence he suddenly leaves out her heritage and said story starts to sound identical to ariana dumbledore s it should also be pointed out that when asked what makes albus dumbledore so fond of him he refuses to answer something is going on here __________________________________________________ ariana s obscurus so could it be that he is actually been watching over ariana s obscurus this is where we get to my mistake from the last version of this theory ariana died in  when newt was only two years old he never met her in person but her brother he knew well but can an obscurus survive for an unlimited amount of time really i can only sum up what we get to see i can t wrap my mind around it yet the obscurus is said to be unable to survive outside the host yet when newt states this it s clearly alive and has been for the entire movie but i think this was just wrong words he probably meant that it can t harm anyone outside it s host the obscurus is said to be a parasite but it seems to be made out of energy can it die does it sleep until finding a new energy source does newt feed it with magic is he doing research on it considering the last point we can actually build up a story starting back in hogwarts ___________________________________________________ the story of albus dumbledore and newt scamander newt scamander and albus dumbledore had always been getting along very well and when dumbledore heard of a possible expelling of his student he of course wanted to help yet he knew that this student would also possibly be able to help him with a problem he had been keeping for years after his sister had died her obscurus remained he couldn t get himself to try kill it since it was part of his sister so he kept it locked away and started to research in order to help those who would be infected in the future without sucess he couldn t find a solution and then he met newt scamander the young man had an extrodinary talent concerning magical creatures and dumbledore found that someone like him could possibly find a solution so when he got expelled from hogwarts dumbledore offered to make possible he could keep his wand but just like with snape he asked something in return he introduced the young man to his secret and tragic family story and asked him to research on the parasite that had been destroying his sister for years newt agreed and hid it inside his suitcase to observe and research on it for the following years of course this had to be kept secret so he made up a story about a girl in sudan that he managed to seperate it from and when he talked to credence he told him the story of dumbledores sister he never had met _____________________________________________________ this is the secret that newt has been keeping just like he was asked to but when will we know for sure i think at one point in the story newt either opens up to someone about the secret or is given verita serum i m certainly looking foward to it so what do you think has newt been keeping ariana dumbledore s obscurus leave a comment if you have something to add thank you very much for reading,the obscuru in the suitcas the truth theori spoiler hi there befor we start thi i have to make a confess i alreadi made a theori on tumblr on the obscuru and where newt could have gotten it from and

___________________________________________ inform so far when we are introduc to the obscuru in the movi we are told it s a parasit that is creat when a young wizard or witch surpress hi magic power it feed on the power but when it becom too strong or when the wizard experi strong neg emot it break out becom one with the wizard caus destruct around or kill it s host _______________________________________________________ newt s obscuru in the movi newt claim to have manag to seper the obscuru from it s host a young girl in sudan yet when he tell the stori to credenc he suddenli leav out her heritag and said stori start to sound ident to ariana dumbledor s it should also be point out that when ask what make albu dumbledor so fond of him he refus to answer someth is go on here __________________________________________________ ariana s obscuru so could it be that he is actual been watch over ariana s obscuru thi is where we get to my mistak from the last version of thi theori ariana die in  when newt wa onli two year old he never met her in person but her brother he knew well but can an obscuru surviv for an unlimit amount of time realli i can onli sum up what we get to see i can t wrap my mind around it yet the obscuru is said to be unabl to surviv outsid the host yet when newt state thi it s clearli aliv and ha been for the entir movi but i think thi wa just wrong word he probabl meant that it can t harm anyon outsid it s host the obscuru is said to be a parasit but it seem to be made out of energi can it die doe it sleep until find a

it s host a young girl in sudan yet when he tell the stori to credenc he suddenli leav out her heritag and said stori start to sound ident to ariana dumbledor s it should also be point out that when ask what make albu dumbledor so fond of him he refus to answer someth is go on here __________________________________________________ ariana s obscuru so could it be that he is actual been watch over ariana s obscuru thi is where we get to my mistak from the last version of thi theori ariana die in  when newt wa onli two year old he never met her in person but her brother he knew well but can an obscuru surviv for an unlimit amount of time realli i can onli sum up what we get to see i can t wrap my mind around it yet the obscuru is said to be unabl to surviv outsid the host yet when newt state thi it s clearli aliv and ha been for the entir movi but i think thi wa just wrong word he probabl meant that it can t harm anyon outsid it s host the obscuru is said to be a parasit but it seem to be made out of energi can it die doe it sleep until find a new energi sourc doe newt feed it with magic is he do research on it consid the last point we can actual build up a stori start back in hogwart ___________________________________________________ the stori of albu dumbledor and newt scamand newt scamand and albu dumbledor had alway been get along veri well and when dumbledor heard of a possibl expel of hi student he of cours want to help yet he knew that thi student would also possibl be abl to help him with a problem he had been keep for year after hi sister had die her obscuru remain he couldn t get himself to tri kill it sinc it wa part of hi sister so he kept it lock away and start to research in order to help those who would be infect in the futur without sucess he couldn t find a solut and then he met newt scamand the young man had an extrodinari talent concern magic creatur and dumbledor found that someon like him could possibl find a solut so when he got expel from hogwart dumbledor offer to make possibl he could keep hi wand but just like with snape he ask someth in return he introduc the young man to hi secret and tragic famili stori and ask him to research on the parasit that had been destroy hi sister for year newt agre and hid it insid hi suitcas to observ and research on it for the follow year of cours thi had to be kept secret so he made up a stori about a girl in sudan that he manag to seper it from and when he talk to credenc he told him the stori of dumbledor sister he never had met _____________________________________________________ thi is the secret that newt ha been keep just like he wa ask to but when will we know for sure i think at one point in the stori newt either open up to someon about the secret or is given verita serum i m certainli look foward to it so what do you think ha newt been keep ariana dumbledor s obscuru leav a comment if you have someth to add thank you veri much for read,"The Obscurus in the suitcase - the truth? (theory (spoiler)) Hi there :)  Before we start this, I have to make a confession: I already made a theory on tumblr on the Obscurus and where Newt could have gotten it from - and completely messed it up concerning the timeline. It’s deleted now.  Today I’m trying again - because I’m still convinced that we haven’t been told the truth about this parasite in Newt’s suitcase. So enjoy :)  ___________________________________________   **Information so far**  When we are introduced to the Obscurus in the movie, we are told it’s a parasite that is created when a young wizard or witch surpresses his magical powers. It feeds on the powers, but when it becomes too strong or when the wizard experiences strong negative emotions, it breaks out, becomes one with the wizard, causes destruction around or kills it’s host.   _______________________________________________________   **Newt’s obscurus**  In the movie, Newt claims to have managed to seperate the obscurus from it’s host, a young girl in Sudan…  Yet when he tells the story to Credence, he suddenly leaves out her heritage and said story starts to sound **identical to Ariana Dumbledore’s**.  It should also be pointed out that when asked what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of him, **he refuses to answer.**  Something is going on here…   __________________________________________________   **Ariana‘s obscurus?**  So… could it be that he is actually been watching over Ariana’s obscurus?  This is where we get to my mistake from the last version of this theory. Ariana died in 1899, when Newt was only two years old.  He never met her in person … but her brother he knew well.  But can an obscurus survive for an unlimited amount of time?   **Really? I can only sum up what we get to see, I can’t wrap my mind around it yet.**   * The Obscurus is said to be unable to survive outside the host - yet when Newt states this, it’s clearly alive and has been for the entire movie… but I think this was just wrong words, he probably meant that it can’t harm anyone outside it’s host. * The Obscurus is said to be a parasite - but it seems to be made out of energy… can it die? Does it sleep until finding a new energy source? Does Newt feed it with magic? Is he doing research on it?  Considering the last point, we can actually build up a story, starting back in Hogwarts.  ___________________________________________________   **The story of Albus Dumbledore and Newt Scamander**  Newt Scamander and Albus Dumbledore had always been getting along very well, and when Dumbledore heard of a possible expelling of his student, he of course wanted to help - yet he knew that this student would also possibly be able to help him with a problem he had been keeping for years…  After his sister had died, her obscurus remained - he couldn’t get himself to try  kill it since it was part of his sister, so he kept it locked away and started to research, in order to help those who would be infected in the future - without sucess.  He couldn’t find a solution … and then he met Newt Scamander  The young man had an extrodinary talent concerning magical creatures, and Dumbledore found that someone like him could possibly find a solution. So, when he got expelled from Hogwarts - Dumbledore offered to make possible he could keep his wand, but just like with Snape - he asked something in return.  He introduced the young man to his secret and tragic family story  - and asked him to research on the parasite that had been destroying his sister for years. Newt agreed, and hid it inside his suitcase, to observe and research on it for the following years.  Of course, this had to be kept secret - so he made up a story about a girl in Sudan, that he managed to seperate it from - and when he talked to Credence, he told him the story of Dumbledores sister he never had met.  _____________________________________________________   This is the secret that Newt has been keeping  just like he was asked to. But when will we know for sure?  I think at one point in the story, Newt either opens up to someone about the secret or is given Verita Serum.  I’m certainly looking foward to it :)  So, what do you think? Has Newt been keeping Ariana Dumbledore’s obscurus? Leave a comment if you have something to add :)  Thank you very much for reading :)"

3689,credence s true identity and how it doesn t even add up with the first   spoilers let s remember the events of fbawtft and try to tie them to this final plot twist aurelius dumbledore evidence  in the first movie grindelwald or graves was looking for a child he didn t even know the child s age or gender let s remember he even believed the obscurial was credence s sister the little blond girl modesty how could he have believed even one second that modesty could be aurelius aurelius is a male name and modesty a girl is ten years younger than credence evidence  he had credence under his nose knew he was a wizard with unknown parents yet he didn t do the math and told himself oh maybe this boy is aurelius dumbledore no because the only thing that mattered to him was the obscurus the dark parasite not the obscurial the carrier of it it didn t matter if the obscurus was a girl a boy a child or a teenager to make short at this point the identity of the obscurial didn t matter conclusion he wasn t looking for aurelius dumbledore but for an obscurus in the first movie so two options now between the two movies grindelwald learned the true identity of credence which is very convenient and convoluted waw the obscurus i was looking for is also albus brother what a coincidence second option he was lying to credence during the last scene in fact we can be sure that grindelwald was partially lying since he said your own brother wants to destroy you we know dumbledore doesn t want to destroy him and he is the one who told newt that credence is leta s brother so dumbledore doesn t even know that credence is his brother was grindelwald lying about the rest probably it s not the first time he lies to credence playing on his deepest desire remember in fb1 he was an abused boy who was looking for love then grindelwald was like you are special you are going to be a wizard you matters acting all touchy touchy because he needed someone to find the child then grindelwald thought he achieved his goal left credence behind and told him he didn t know who his parents were he was nothing special and was probably a squib all his promises were lie it s the same pattern here what is credence s greatest desire during the movie finding his family how convenient for grindelwald to suddenly be like i know how you parents are and albus dumbledore your brother wants to kill you grindelwald needs a weapon against dumbledore and an obscurial is the perfect one probably because of ariana credence is foolish and angry right now no wizards in their right mind would attack dumbledore but since he isn t really part of the magic community he doesn t fear him so he is going to do it proof grindelwald told his partisans when they asked him why credence mattered so much if i ask you to go to hogwarts and kill dumbledore would you do it no they wouldn t because they aren t suicidal i m sure if modesty was revealed to be the obscurial in the first movie then grindelwald would have been modesty your true name is adela dumbledore and your brother wants to kill you random thought there is like  years between dumbledore and credence was kendra still fertile to give birth to another son it s canon that percival went to azkaban in  i don t know if it s possible to conceive a child in azkaban because credence doesn t look to be  years old what about the phoenix then

the dumbledor dure hi youth he wait for the phoenix to die and resurrect as a chick he know where credenc wa live in pari so he put the phoenix under hi window at night and voilà the trick is done,"Credence’s true identity and how it doesn’t even add up with the first Fantastic Beasts (SPOILERS). Let’s remember the events of FBAWTFT and try to tie them to this final plot twist, “Aurelius Dumbledore”:  - Evidence 1: In the first movie, Grindelwald (or Graves) was looking for a “child”. He didn’t even know the child’s age or gender. Let’s remember, he even believed the Obscurial was “Credence’s sister”, the little blond girl, Modesty. How could he have believed, even one second, that Modesty could be Aurelius? Aurelius is a male name and Modesty, a girl, is ten years younger than Credence.   - Evidence 2 : He had Credence under his nose, knew he was a wizard with unknown parents. Yet he didn’t do the math and told himself “Oh maybe this boy is Aurelius Dumbledore?”  - No because, the only thing that mattered to him was the Obscurus (the dark parasite), not the Obscurial (the carrier of it). It didn’t matter if the Obscurus was a girl, a boy, a child or a teenager. To make short, at this point, the identity of the Obscurial didn’t matter.   - Conclusion : he wasn’t looking for Aurelius Dumbledore but for an Obscurus in the first movie.   So two options now :  - Between the two movies , Grindelwald learned the “true identity” of Credence which is very convenient and convoluted. (Waw the Obscurus I was looking for is also Albus brother! What a coincidence!).  - Second option, he was lying to Credence during the last scene.   - In fact, we can be sure that Grindelwald was partially lying since he said “your own brother wants to destroy you”. We know Dumbledore doesn’t want to destroy him and he is the one who told Newt that Credence is Leta’s brother. So Dumbledore doesn’t even know that Credence is “his brother”.   - Was Grindelwald lying about the rest? Probably.   - It’s not the first time, he lies to Credence, playing on his deepest desire. Remember? In FB1, he was an abused boy who was looking for love. Then Grindelwald was like “You are special” “You are going to be a wizard” “You matters” acting all touchy touchy because he needed someone to find the “child”. Then, Grindelwald thought he achieved his goal, left Credence behind and told him he didn’t know who his parents were, he was nothing special and was probably a Squib. All his promises were lie.   - It’s the same pattern here. What is Credence’s greatest desire during the movie? Finding his family. How convenient for Grindelwald to suddenly be like “I know how you parents are and Albus Dumbledore, your brother, wants to kill you.” Grindelwald needs a weapon against Dumbledore and an Obscurial is the perfect one (probably because of Ariana). Credence is foolish and angry right now, no wizards in their right mind would attack Dumbledore but since he isn’t really part of the magic community, he doesn’t fear him, so he is going to do it.   - Proof : Grindelwald told his partisans when they asked him why Credence mattered so much. “If I ask you to go to Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore, would you do it?” No they wouldn’t because they aren’t suicidal.   - I’m sure if Modesty was revealed to be the Obscurial in the first movie then Grindelwald would have been “Modesty, your true name is Adela Dumbledore and your brother wants to kill you”.  Random thought:   - There is like 25 years between Dumbledore and Credence, was Kendra still fertile to give birth to another son?   - It’s canon that Percival went to Azkaban in 1891. I don’t know if it’s possible to conceive a child in Azkaban because Credence doesn’t look to be 36 years old.   - What about the Phoenix then? Grindelwald catch or buy a Phoenix. Maybe the Phoenix was with him all along and stolen from the Dumbledore during his youth. He waits for the Phoenix to die and resurrect as a chick. He knows where Credence was living in Paris, so he put the Phoenix under his window at night and voilà, the trick is done."

While discussing that a horcrux could be anything, Harry touches the ring and it begins to spin rapidly and Harry sees rapid images flash within his mind. The scene then cuts back to Harry and his neck moves the way it did in Order of the Pheonix — when Harry’s connecting to Voldemort.   We then see Dumbledore staring intently at Harry, potentially truly recognizing Harry as a horcrux for the first time because of the exceptional reaction the two horcrux carriers (Harry and the ring) just had to each other.   While Dumbledore was obviously sure at this point Voldemort had made multiple horcruxes and that Harry and Voldemort were undeniably connected, perhaps it was in this single moment during the movies Dumbledore realized WHY Harry and Voldemort where so similar. WHY they were connected.   What do you guys think?"

Hear me out about this. Let me first say the Grindelwald is not Hitler. Hitler had no reason to get rid of Jews like he did. Grindelwald on the other hand kinda has just motives for wanting to expose wizard kind. You even hear him say that he doesn’t want to kill all muggles but only the necessary amount. Plus we have to remember the position they are in. To most wizards it isn’t fair how they cannot be free and cannot marry who they want and express themselves. After thinking for a while can we really consider him being a villain. Yes he does some very bad things but as he said in his mind he is doing it for the greater good. He wants to forcefully expose wizard kind. You can also see the regret he has after killing the muggle family in Paris. That look to me means that he is making the hard choices for the greater good. Also we have to consider the ministry now as well. Like they are true villain of this movie. Anyone who listens to him must be arrested. Have you heard of free speech. They choose to listen. They were not forced. Also Travers practically put Dumbledore on house arrest because he won’t help them. It is not like they can make him. Bottom line, how can we consider him a villain when he wants to help wizards. And until we know whether he wants to get rid of most if not all of Muggles like Vinda Rosier, or just want to harm some more to forcefully expose Wizard kind and rule with them or over them. He wants wizards free. Is that so bad no matter the cost."

In Deathly Hallows, we finally get an explanation as to why Petunia hates the magical world: She was super jealous that her sister Lily got to be a witch but she didn't. She developed a lifelong hatred of the magical world as a means of being in self-denial about her jealousy.  So what about Vernon? Has Rowling ever given his backstory that caused him to hate wizards?  The closest I've ever heard is that Vernon was having lunch with James one day, he asked James what kind of car he drove, and when James described his broomstick, Vernon felt insulted, like he was being played for a fool.  That's ... honestly kind of shallow, don't you think? I mean, that sounds like the sort of thing that could easily be fixed with a simple apology. Sure, James was an arrogant jackass as a kid. We see as much in OotP, Chapter 28 (""Snape's Worst Memory""), but Lupin and Sirius explain to Harry that Lily fell in love with James after James had matured up. So by the time he and Vernon are meeting, it seems odd that James would have made no effort to apologize for offending Vernon and clarify what he was saying.  But even if James never did that, it feels kind of shallow of Vernon to assume that literally every witch or wizard in existence was arrogant to the point of seeing muggles as inferior. When was the last time you met one person who was a part of any group, who you met only once in your entirely life, and developed a lifelong hatred of everyone in that group as a result of that one interaction?  Then again, maybe Vernon really is just that much of a shallow asshole. But if Rowling went to such lengths to give depth to Petunia, the why not Vernon too?"

2619,fiendfyre hellfire so this is either really obvious and i'm just now noticing or this is gonna sound off the wall i didnt read this just my own showerthoughts but is fiendfyre from/of hell so jk obviously won't say one way or the other for obvious reasons however after thinking on it it seems rather obvious for one the name fiend which is associated/synonymous with demons demons from hell then we have the effects  mentions the being biting the stuff that the fire burns and crabbe is stated to not be able to control it so the spell does this of its own accord without help from the caster perhaps because the fire is summoned straight from the pits of hell with the fiends/demons still in it the monsters within are beings often thought of as demonic like chimera serpents and dragons while dragons are real animals in  maybe there's dragon like beings in  hell idk we never see  hell ask bellatrix it's said this spell is powerful dark magic why would a fire spell be explicitly dark magic regular fire is a spell a first year can cast it's nearly impossible to control both of these make sense if you consider that it's from hell lastly it can destroy a horcrux because the fire burns souls it's one of two substances in the world that can destroy a horcrux so to recap it's from hell because it's named after demons literally has demons within it is explicitly stated to be evil and has the capability to destroy something housing a soul obviously this will never be confirmed since jk doesn't want to go constantine and that's fine still an interesting thought,fiendfyr hellfir so thi is either realli obviou and i'm just now notic or thi is gonna sound off the wall i didnt read thi just my own showerthought but is fiendfyr from/of hell so jk obvious won't say one way or the other for obviou reason howev after think on it it seem rather obviou for one the name fiend which is associated/synonym with demon demon from hell then we have the effect  mention the be bite the stuff that the fire burn and crabb is state to not be abl to control it so the spell doe thi of it own accord without help from the caster perhap becaus the fire is summon straight from the pit of hell with the fiends/demon still in it the monster within are be often thought of as demon like chimera serpent and dragon while dragon are real anim in  mayb there' dragon like be in  hell idk we never see  hell ask bellatrix it' said thi spell is power dark magic whi would a fire spell be explicitli dark magic regular fire is a spell a first year can cast it' nearli imposs to control both of these make sens if you consid that it' from hell lastli it can destroy a horcrux becaus the fire burn soul it' one of two substanc in the world that can destroy a horcrux so to recap it' from hell becaus it' name after demon liter ha demon within it is explicitli state to be evil and ha the capabl to destroy someth hous a soul obvious thi will never be confirm sinc jk doesn't want to go constantin and that' fine still an interest thought,fiendfyr hellfir so thi is either realli obviou and i'm just now notic or thi is gonna sound off the wall i didnt read thi just my own showerthought but is fiendfyr from/of hell so jk obvious won't say one way or the other for obviou reason howev after think on it it seem rather obviou for one the name fiend which is associated/synonym with demon demon from hell then we have the effect  mention the be bite the stuff that the fire burn and crabb is state to not be abl to control it so the spell doe thi of it own accord without help from the caster perhap becaus the fire is summon straight from the pit of hell with the fiends/demon still in it the monster within are be often thought of as demon like chimera serpent and dragon while dragon are real anim in  mayb there' dragon like be in  hell idk we never see  hell ask bellatrix it' said thi spell is power dark magic whi would a fire spell be explicitli dark magic regular fire is a spell a first year can cast it' nearli imposs to control both of these make sens if you consid that it' from hell lastli it can destroy a horcrux becaus the fire burn soul it' one of two substanc in the world that can destroy a horcrux so to recap it' from hell becaus it' name after demon liter ha demon within it is explicitli state to be evil and ha the capabl to destroy someth hous a soul obvious thi will never be confirm sinc jk doesn't want to go constantin and that' fine still an interest thought,"Fiendfyre = Hellfire? So this is either really obvious and I'm just now noticing, or this is gonna sound off the wall. I didnt read this, just my own showerthoughts, but is fiendfyre from/of Hell?    So JK obviously won't say one way or the other for obvious reasons. However, after thinking on it, it seems rather obvious.   For one, the name. Fiend, which is associated/synonymous with demons. Demons from Hell. Then we have the effects. Harry mentions the being biting the stuff that the fire burns. And Crabbe is stated to not be able to control it, so the spell does this of its own accord without help from the caster. Perhaps because the fire is summoned straight from the pits of Hell with the fiends/demons still in it. The monsters within are beings often thought of as demonic, like chimera, serpents, and dragons. While dragons are real animals in Potterverse, maybe there's dragon-like beings in Potterverse Hell?  Idk, we never see Potterverse Hell. Ask Bellatrix.   It's said this spell is powerful dark magic. Why would a fire spell be explicitly dark magic?  Regular fire is a spell a first year can cast. It's nearly impossible to control. Both of these make sense if you consider that it's from Hell.   Lastly, it can destroy a horcrux. Because the fire burns souls. It's one of two substances in the world that can destroy a horcrux.   So to recap. It's from Hell because it's named after demons, literally has demons within it, is explicitly stated to be evil, and has the capability to destroy something housing a soul.   Obviously this will never be confirmed since JK doesn't want to go Constantine. And that's fine. Still an interesting thought."

128,i think i've had a third turnaround on snape so i saw all the movies before having read the books obviously the first turn was seeing the prince's tale in the final movie although in the movies he's not even that terrible in the first place besides killing dumbledore which was way more telegraphed what with snape seeing  under the tower snape sorta bad gt snape good the second was when i was finally reading the books about a year ago and it was revealed that snape was the one who heard the prophecy and ultimately got the  killed by telling voldemort i was pretty buzzed up and i cried my eyes out in hatred and at the fact that i'd been tricked into liking snape by the movies he was the absolute worst and anything good he did he did only out of a duty to serve lily's memory snape good gt snape terrible since then i've read through the series a couple more times and read many discussions on this sub and for the most part i had fallen into the snape is grey lot i still think that he's a giant douche almost all the time and most of the good things he did he did not because he was good but just out of a sense of duty to lily since he got her killed one could argue that doing good things for the wrong reasons is the first step towards goodness but i didn't think snape would ever take any further steps towards it he's too rooted in bitterness still so this morning i was re listening to an episode of binge mode hp specifically the episode on the prince's tale they were talking about how as snape was dying he was desperate to share his memories to be understood and here's where i came to the third turn i realized that a ton of the content of the prince's tale didn't need to be there snape didn't need to be so open with  he could have gotten the message across that  was a horcrux in far fewer memories and without putting his shame out there for  to see furthermore he knows that  will go to die after seeing the memories so he's not sharing them in the hopes that everyone will appreciate his sacrifice it means that much to him just that  understands him i have always been reluctant to believe that snape cared for  but here's the proof of course that doesn't retroactively make him a good person throughout the story so snape as a character still falls into morally grey but i now firmly believe that at the least snape died as a good character who truly cared for  and i think that's enough for me to switch over to team snape thoughts,i think i'v had a third turnaround on snape so i saw all the movi befor have read the book obvious the first turn wa see the prince' tale in the final movi although in the movi he' not even that terribl in the first place besid kill dumbledor which wa way more telegraph what with snape see  under the tower snape sorta bad gt snape good the second wa when i wa final read the book about a year ago and it wa reveal that snape wa the one who heard the propheci and ultim got the  kill by tell voldemort i wa pretti buzz up and i cri my eye out in hatr and at the fact that i'd been trick into like snape by the movi he wa the absolut worst and anyth good he did he did onli out of a duti to serv lily' memori snape good gt snape terribl sinc then i'v read through the seri a coupl more time and read mani discuss on thi sub and for the most part i had fallen into the snape is grey lot i still think that he' a giant douch almost all the time and most of the good thing he did he did not becaus he wa good but just out of a sens of duti to lili sinc he got her kill one could argu that do good thing for the wrong reason is the first step toward good but i didn't think snape would ever take ani further step toward it he' too root in bitter still so thi morn i wa re listen to an episod of bing mode hp specif the episod on the prince' tale they were talk about how as snape wa die he wa desper to share hi memori to be understood and here' where i came to the third turn i realiz that a ton of the

11,how is blood status determined can someone clarify this the beginnings of blood status are simple wizard/witch wizard/witch pure blood wizard/witch muggle half blood muggle muggle muggle born sounds simple right my question is if you re muggle born like lily or hermione but then are magic and then you have kids do you count as a muggle or a witch would their kids be pure blood if they got together with another wizard/witch is there some grey area they just never talk about this specifically applies to  who i m fairly confident is referred to as pure blooded,how is blood statu determin can someon clarifi thi the begin of blood statu are simpl wizard/witch wizard/witch pure blood wizard/witch muggl half blood muggl muggl muggl born sound simpl right my question is if you re muggl born like lili or hermion but then are magic and then you have kid do you count as a muggl or a witch would their kid be pure blood if they got togeth with anoth wizard/witch is there some grey area they just never talk about thi specif appli to  who i m fairli confid is refer to as pure blood,how is blood statu determin can someon clarifi thi the begin of blood statu are simpl wizard/witch wizard/witch pure blood wizard/witch muggl half blood muggl muggl muggl born sound simpl right my question is if you re muggl born like lili or hermion but then are magic and then you have kid do you count as a muggl or a witch would their kid be pure blood if they got togeth with anoth wizard/witch is there some grey area they just never talk about thi specif appli to  who i m fairli confid is refer to as pure blood,How is blood status determined? Can someone clarify this? The beginnings of blood status are simple  Wizard/Witch + Wizard/Witch = Pure Blood Wizard/Witch + Muggle = Half Blood Muggle + Muggle = Muggle Born Sounds simple right?  My question is...if you’re Muggle born like Lily or Hermione but then are magic and then you have kids do you count as a Muggle or a witch? Would their kids be pure blood if they got together with another wizard/witch? Is there some grey area they just never talk about? This specifically applies to Harry who I’m fairly confident is referred to as pure blooded.

3882,no more tricks theory hi there there is a chance that credence will probably have a hard time trusting tina in the upcoming movie but unfortunately it likely won t be just her hope i can sum up all the possible reasons enjoy ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ authority issues ever since his near death by the hand of the aurors of macusa credence certainly holds a grudge against the wizarding administration in america not only because of the attack but also for their failure in finding him in years he may have heard that children in non magic families can be detected by authorities though he may find that since he successfully surpressed his magic for years they may not be responsible nor for not noticing grindelwald s infiltration though there is a chance that he believes they secretly collide with him which i wouldn t put past either also through the attack he may have problems trusting authorities in general now though this is not unfounded credence has endangered the secrecy of the wizarding world killed three no majes and was proven to be almost impossible to control he must know the international wizarding police will try to eliminate him at any cost this was also supported by skender in a deleted scene by the end of the first movie who stressed that he d face a capital punishment if he stayed in america grindelwald s part during the last movie also certainly has added to his paranoia no matter how conscious he was when the dark lord was arrested the story must have circled through magic newspapers everywhere later on how is he supposed to trust anyone s face or anyone who offers his help no matter how convincingly supportive these issues will also make it much harder for strangers like jacob queenie or theseus to approach him but the chance of someone tricking him these ways is only the beginning of his suspicions _________________________________________________________________________________________ official problems i ve mentioned in a previous theory that credence may not trust tina any longer when she tried to calm him down during the last movie he was attacked and at least briefly severely injured he may have misunderstood the situation and especially now that she has joined the auror s division once more think that she seeks to deliver him to authorities upon gaining his trust even if queenie managed to bring back the memory of how she protected him from mary lou will he believe her intentions were good will he believe in this memory at all according to hp wiki he had dreams of the incident after his obliviation but does he believe them or believe them to be tricks another almost similar problem occurs concerning newt during credence journey through europe with circus arcanus  beast and where to find them was published whether he was in england at the right time or the book was translated quickly enough to be mentioned in a newspaper in another country he d need a translator for that but why not there may be many people from different countries at the circus and he certainly wants to keep himself informed especially after grindelwald s escape and he saw a photo of the man he d met in new york a whole new story may have formed in his head and not a good one he knows newt and tina are friends which may make him suspicious in his eyes already but he may have read that newt is working at the beast division in the british ministry of magic he may assume that he was sent to approach him in new york as it is also increasingly public knowledge that he has an astounding talent with magical  even highly dangerous ones such as dragons and credence obscurus form comes undeniably close to this he may have concluded that newt has similar orders as tina hence why he would defend him against grindelwald or rather keeping him from recruting the boy especially considering which certainly was mentioned in a newspaper that he is the younger brother of a famous british auror he may also think as a fellow tumblr user stated that the two of them may plan to use his unique powers for their own purposes or maybe that the ministries seek to use him as a human weapon against grindelwald or to harvest his powers so considering all this the group is facing a solid wall of issues how can they gain his trust how can anyone even get him to listen is there any way he can be convinced _________________________________________________________ because frankly i can t

Hi there :)  There is a chance that Credence will probably have a hard time trusting Tina in the upcoming movie … but unfortunately, it likely won’t be just her…   Hope I can sum up all the possible

He may have heard that children in non-magic families can be detected by authorities – though he may find that since he successfully surpressed his magic for years, they may not be responsible … nor for not noticing Grindelwald’s infiltration, though there is a chance that he believes they secretly collide with him (which I wouldn’t put past either).  Also, through the attack, he may have problems trusting authorities in general now – though this is not unfounded. Credence has endangered the secrecy of the wizarding world, killed three no-majes and was proven to be almost impossible to control… he must know the International Wizarding Police will try to eliminate him at any cost. This was also supported by Skender in a deleted scene by the end of the first movie, who stressed that he’d face a capital punishment if he stayed in America.    Grindelwald’s part during the last movie also certainly has added to his paranoia – no matter how conscious he was when the dark lord was arrested, the story must have circled through magic newspapers everywhere later on… how is he supposed to trust anyone’s face? Or anyone who offers his help, no matter how convincingly supportive?  These issues will also make it much harder for strangers like Jacob, Queenie or Theseus to approach him.  But the chance of someone tricking him these ways is only the beginning of his suspicions…   _________________________________________________________________________________________    **Official problems**  I’ve mentioned in a previous theory that Credence may not trust Tina any longer… when she tried to calm him down during the last movie, he was attacked and, at least briefly, severely injured … he may have misunderstood the situation and, especially now that she has joined the auror’s division once more, think that she seeks to deliver him to authorities upon gaining his trust. Even if Queenie managed to bring back the memory of how she protected him from Mary Lou – will he believe her intentions were good? Will he believe in this memory at all?  According to HP wiki, he had dreams of the incident after his obliviation... but does he believe them? Or believe them to be tricks?  Another almost similar problem occurs concerning Newt … during Credence journey through Europe with Circus Arcanus, “Fantastic Beast and where to find them” was published … whether he was in England at the right time or the book was translated quickly enough to be mentioned in a newspaper in another country (he’d need a translator for that, but why not – there may be many people from different countries at the Circus, and he certainly wants to keep himself informed, especially after Grindelwald’s escape) and he saw a photo of the man he’d met in New York, a whole new story may have formed in his head … and not a good one…  He knows Newt and Tina are friends … which may make him suspicious in his eyes already.

How can anyone even get him to listen?  Is there any way he can be convinced?   _________________________________________________________    Because frankly, I can’t wrap my mind around this yet. Maybe Leta will figure out a surprising way, maybe Maledictus will convince him to give them a chance  … or Newt and Tina simply free all the people and creatures from Circus Arcanus to show that they value life over law. But that’s just my headcannon :)  Anyway, what do you think? How is Credence going to join the group on his own accord? Please let me know :)  Thank you very much for reading :)"

Harry, Ron and Hermione were adamant about never telling anyone else about the existence of the horcruxes until the very end. In Harry's final faceoff with Voldemort, he tells him that his horcruxes are destroyed, heard by everyone present.  I assume that after a good long sleep and a sandwich, Harry, Ron and Hermione debriefed everyone about what they had been doing for the previous nine months. I'm sure Kingsley, as the new Minister of Magic, was particularly interested.  My question is, was this information ever conveyed to the wider population. Maybe the ministry would prefer to keep awareness of such dark magic out of the public eye, so as to not encourage any copycats from following Voldemort's path. But with people like Rita Skeeter always looking for a juicy story, it could have been difficult."

Why did he attempt to kill Molly? He didn't even have that intense of a reaction when Nagini died and it was definitely not because he was afraid to lose the war. Lord Voldemort would never rely on a single Death Eater who didn't even master her wand especially when he thought that he was the master of the Elder Wand. What was the point of this? It was not significant to the plot in any way. Why did JK Rowling have him do it? What did she think? I think it was just stupid and waste of lines. Did she try to humanise him or something? If that was the case, then it was an extremely stupid thing to even try. Bellatrix's death is the only part in the Battle of Hogwarts that I prefer in the movies because there is no scream. I cringed at the scream. Why did she have to do it? I just need to know why it was worth mentioning in the books. And Snape was clearly his favourite at that time, not Bellatrix. It makes no sense that he didn't even regret Snape's death but went all bonkers on the death of a woman who had lost him a piece of his soul less than a day ago. I am not saying that he would regret Snape's death. What I am saying is that Lord Voldemort would never react like that to the death of a mere servant. I cannot accept the scream as canon, no matter what."

First and foremost, location helps. At Alamo, they had a string quartet playing songs from the movies and the 1920’s. We saw amazing cosplayers and you could feel the energy in the theatre once we filed in.  I felt it started strong but my wife said she didn’t follow the carriage scene well. Now knowing the ending, I’m curious why GG has the blood pact to begin with.  I enjoyed enchanted Jacob. Bravo to the actor for making me believe it without question.  I understand it has to touch all fans but the Leta/Newt/Tina thing didn’t grab me much UNTIL I questioned if Leta’s last words were, in fact, directed at Newt.  Some absolutely amazing lines, incredible creatures and I’m thankful they didn’t try to overdue it with the baby nifflers. They were there, they were cute and we got to move on.  I was blown away by Jude Law and Johnny Depp! They each performed brilliantly and sold me on their characters 100%!  Queenie broke my heart, but we can hold out for the imperious curse or something in the tea since it was being so pushy.  GG is such a good liar that we almost believe him at the end but I’m holding out and disagree  My one bone to pick although I absolutely loved watching McGonagall, are we going to skip over the fact that she wasn’t born until 1935???"

1562,i've got an idea for a   video game with portkey games advertising wizards unite on youtube i was thinking idly one day about what kind of game would work most efficiently in the   universe and i came up with this i'd appreciate feedback on what you guys all think of it seeing as you more than likely know your stuff when it comes to this your character is a muggle who basically stumbled into the plot by accident as a terrorist cell of dark wizards has emerged and things are going wrong all over the place you are either immune to memory charms or manage to avoid being hit by one and you end up finding a way to infiltrate the ministry of magic to get answers to everything or find at least somebody accountable noticing how skilled you are at infiltrating  notes that your life has already been ruined even before you got into the ministry and he also takes note of your talent for infiltrating places you are then asked to help stop the terrorists and find out what's going on with the help of ron having george weasley and hermione granger help him in putting together specialized gadgets making wizarding wheezes into what is in essence a covertly outsourced q branch that gives the player magically enchanted gadgets and artefacts to assist in game should you be captured or killed the memories of people who know you well will be modified and the ministry will deny your very existence the story could have elements of the mysteries that the novels have going on in spades thanks to its linear level by level setup but the levels are still large sprawling castles and secret bases non linear in nature with the player given a list of objectives a large level and away you go maybe you'll knock somebody out and break their wand to stop them being a threat or maybe you'll steal all kinds of stuff from them that incriminates them and ask hermione to get rita skeeter to publish an article ruining their reputation forever or maybe you'll just steal all their stuff and bankrupt them i don't know maybe you'll get past some hostiles by using a deluminator to knock out some light sources maybe you'll use a gadget or artefact that allows you to turn invisible and you'll cautiously weave through the guards before the effect wears off or maybe you'll just chuck a golden snitch at them from where they can't see you and slip away undetected because the guards are too busy falling over themselves trying to catch the annoying thing to notice some schmuck sneaking about or maybe you'll just pull out an enchanted club and pick them off one by one knocking them all out not killing them of course j k doesn't like that sort of thing so let's not put it in the game it's not the point after all your enemies however may not think the same way you may think that having a melee weapon to bludgeon enemies into unconsciousness is empowering but up against  guards with the body bind curse or even the killing curse yeah you're going to want to remain stealthy this would provide a large amount of tension with the payoff being the somewhat amusing and deliciously awesome fact that you just won against a bunch of wizards as a mere muggle with simple gadgets that a

Okay, once again **MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!!** If you haven't watched the movie go watch it before you read further, because these are probably the biggest spoilers you could ever hear for something Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts related, except for maybe Half-Blood Prince spoilers. So yeah...you've been warned. Now let's get started! Okay first of all, the beginning! When Grindlewald tricked the MACUSA employees, wow! I was like in my seat in the theater trying not explode! That was the moment when I realized that I was gonna love this movie more than the original one. Second thing, Newt has a BROTHER? Wow... Okay enough about that, more about young Dumbledore! I'm so used to seeing old Dumbledore with white hair and glasses. But, young Dumbledore is like, wow! He's so cool, handsome, basically the wizard anyone and everyone would want to date! Then like he tells Newt to go to Paris, and I'm just like wha...ya know Newt has a travel ban, right? Can't you go yourself? You don't have a travel ban! But, like we do find out why later in the movie so...it's fine. Then we see Newt's basement like wow! It's so amazing! The baby nifflers though so cute! Last but not least, Queenie!!! She so shouldn't have put the spell on Jacob! She really should've let him choose! Whelp, come back later for the other parts! Bye!"

He saw first hand the struggles and torment Harry dealt with his entire childhood. I truly believe Snape is no hero. He acted selfishly though the entire story. It started when he gave Voldemort the information that lead to Lilly and James being killed. Then, the only reason she swapped sides is because he wanted revenge on Voldemort for killing Lilly- and his motivations never changed. It was “always” about losing Lilly. Then his torment of Harry just because Harry was James son despite being VERY aware of his struggles and difficulty. I just don’t buy the story that he was some unsung hero."

He is so desperate for Snape not to realise that he is there (to save getting into trouble) that he helps Moody get the Marauders Map ahead of him. Imagine if Snape had grabbed it, spotted Barty Crouch Jr and realised the plan? Just love that after all these years (always) I still find little pivot points that had to happen a certain way for the stories to progress as they did."

I know it's a hard no right now, but do you think J.K. Rowling will ever cave and novelize these movies?     Writing a novel isn't really something you ""cave"" into doing since it's such a massive, exhausting affair (I assume), so I'm not sure how this would happen. Maybe sometime over the next few years, Rowling will have a change of heart and decide she really wants to make these stories into books. Seems unlikely though.  & #   But *man* it would be great to have full-fledged, detail-rich book versions. The plot would have so much more room to stretch out and things that don't seem to make sense would be much clearer. I think it would also help at the box office. Some people may not care about these movies about this random guy who isn't Harry Potter, but if there were new book installments in J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, I think more people would eat that up and come out to see the films. Having books to base the movies off of would probably benefit the plots too, as Yates would have a ton of scenes to pick from in composing the film.  & #   *Ugh*. I wish this were happening. Does anyone think novelizations (written by Rowling or not) will ever happen? Has anyone been quoted as saying something that suggests they might?"

So I know the title makes absolutely no sense at first, but bear with me here. This has been bothering me for a while.  So Pottermore, a couple months ago, tweeted that wizards, back in the days of old, ""wizards simply relieved themselves where they stood and vanished the evidence.""  I'm sure you all heard it. It was, after all, crucial information in building the Wizarding World's canon.  So how does this relate to Hogwarts? Well, according to Pottermore, Hogwarts was founded some time in the 10th century, well before the advent of modern plumbing in the late 18th century. Pottermore states that modern plumbing wasn't implemented until muggles invented it, which means it's unlikely the Founders were ahead of their time in that particular regard.  This means that the girl's restroom which houses the Chamber was either  A. Originally a girl's bathroom (Slytherin, you dog), and later renovated to add sinks and toilets and the like. Or. B. Not a bathroom at all and made into one at a later date with sinks and toilets and the like.  Seeing as the basilisk ran through pipes hidden throughout the school, I find it difficult to believe that anybody or any crew could renovate and tear apart an entire room without finding the Chamber beforehand.   So what gives?   If wizards doodoo'ed on the floor, how did the chamber remain secret?? These are the hard hitting questions that need answering!  P.S. I like to imagine a magical construction crew of exclusively parselmouths (preferably named Parselmouth Plumbers) that discovered the Chamber and never told anybody. And maybe one of them carved that little snake on the sink.  Or, y'know, Wizards didn't poopookaka on the floor.  Thoughts?"

3200,spoiler theory queenie is snape   hello everybody after seeing   the crimes of grindelwald  times i got out of the theater this last time convinced that queenie is snape   and abernathy is the key to understanding the behavior of queenie and tina in this film abernathy was supervisor of the goldstein sisters at macusa in new york and he was responsible for their activities and knowing their whereabouts how could the goldstein sisters not have noticed their boss at macusa behaving strangely and then disappearing altogether to serve grindelwald it doesn't appear to be explained in the screenplay this is especially curious as in the previous film queenie is shown apparently reading abernathy's mind and manipulating him as she is carrying the suitcase with tina and newt inside so here's the theory once abernathy started acting strange and finally disappeared in order to serve grindelwald and take his place in prison tina and queenie caught on to what was happening queenie could hear everything that was going on in abernathy s head and therefore she and her sister knew more than most others about grindelwald s plan and perhaps how creedance was a part of it when the escape happened the sisters hatched a plan to go to paris to find creedence save him from being killed by aurors from the ministries of several countries and also subtly work against grindelwald along the way the sisters planned to enlist the help of newt scamander and by association dumbledore s help as well it's also important to note that tina and queenie gained new knowledge by becoming friends with newt scamander tina was present at newt s interrogation at macusa so she knows he wasn't really in new york for appaloosa puffskins or even his thunderbird frank it was mostly a cover story for his mission on behalf of dumbledore so following newt's example the sisters develop their own cover story for their trip to europe tina going to paris as her auror self seeking out creedance as she always has and as grindelwald would fully expect her to queenie travelling to england on the pretense of marrying jacob but really to recruit newt scamander to help them queenie left the torn up paris

Hello everybody!  After seeing Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald 3 times, I got out of the theater this last time convinced that **Queenie is Snape 2.0**, and **Abernathy is the key** to understanding the behavior of Queenie and Tina in this film...  & #   Abernathy was supervisor of the Goldstein sisters at MACUSA in New York, and he was responsible for their activities and knowing their whereabouts.  How could the Goldstein sisters *not* have noticed their boss at MACUSA behaving strangely and then disappearing altogether to serve Grindelwald? It doesn't appear to be explained in the screenplay.  This is especially curious, as in the previous film Queenie is shown apparently reading Abernathy's mind and manipulating him as she is carrying the suitcase with Tina and Newt inside...  & #   **So here's the theory:**  Once Abernathy started acting strange and finally disappeared in order to serve Grindelwald and take his place in prison, Tina and Queenie caught on to what was happening.  Queenie could hear everything that was going on in Abernathy’s head, and therefore she and her sister knew more than most others about Grindelwald’s plan and perhaps how Creedance was a part of it.  When the escape happened, the sisters hatched a plan to go to Paris to find Creedence, save him from being killed by aurors from the ministries of several countries, and also subtly work against Grindelwald.   Along the way, the sisters planned to enlist the help of Newt Scamander (and by association, Dumbledore’s help as well).  It's also important to note that Tina and Queenie gained new knowledge by becoming friends with Newt Scamander: Tina was present at Newt’s interrogation at MACUSA, so she knows he wasn't really in New York for appaloosa puffskins or even his thunderbird Frank.....it was mostly a cover story for his mission on behalf of Dumbledore.  So, following Newt's example, the sisters develop their own cover story for their trip to Europe:   Tina going to Paris as her Auror self, seeking out Creedance as she always has (and as Grindelwald would fully expect her to). Queenie travelling to England on the pretense of marrying Jacob, but really to recruit Newt Scamander to help them.    Queenie left the torn up Paris postcard in the London house for Newt to find, so that he could join the sisters in their mission in Paris.   It seems like too much of a coincidence in Paris, when Queenie enters the ministry just after Rosier and her former boss Abernathy. In fact, as Queenie asks very awkwardly and obviously at the ministry where her sister is..... she spills her suitcase just as Vinda Rosier and Abernathy walk past. Queenie should have been able to hear their thoughts and immediately should have recognised her former MACUSA boss with or without his polyjuice potion disguise...  Things appear to have gone a little haywire, however, when Queenie ""drank the tea"" at Grindelwald's hideout, and came under his manipulative influence...  & #   I really believe, along with a few others here, that in the next films Queenie will mirror Severus Snape. She will stay close to Creedance/Aurelius to protect him, and use her skills in legillimancy (and occulancy?) to undermine Grindelwald's plans.  & #   What do you guys think? Does this theory with Abernathy make any sense, or could this be a plot hole in the film?  Sorry for any mistakes, this is only my third post on Reddit and I'm still figuring all this out! :)  Your feedback, comments and corrections would be really appreciated!"

After Newt &  Tina remove the beast from Yusuf’s eye, Tina tries to dash off from Flamel’s saying she has to get back to the ministry to report her findings.  There is no record of Tina working for the French ministry according to the woman working the entrance, and yet Tina tries to report back to the ministry. Was the woman working the main entrance lying? If Queenie &  Tina weren’t talking, did someone else send the postcard to Queenie? Did Grindelwald send the postcard? Was Roselier (spelling, sorry) retrieving Queenie from the rain intentionally set up by Grindelwald months in advance?  This is all pretty random theorizing on my part but I just keep thinking about the amount of time Grindelwald was impersonating Graves, and how closely he was working with Tina at MACUSA. It would make sense if Grindelwald knew about Queenie’s legillimency."

3915,leta and theseus a spy story hi there i've already posted a theory on how the engagement of leta lestrange and theseus scamander was possibly based on love potion or experimental magic yet recently another conclusion popped up in my head what if they're not in love but acting as spies for the two sides of the upcoming war _____________________________ theseus we know so far that theseus is the head of the aurors department in the british ministry of magic when grindelwald escapes in  and starts to gather followers there may be concerns in the ministry that a widely known family of dark wizards the lestranges may soonly be joining his forces they decide it's best to keep an eye on them several and especially one of them that theseus has known for a long time since she was his brothers best friend not only could he have agreed to this because he knows her and her family are at risk to join grindelwald but also because she's known for experiments maybe even skilled at this and allegedly confused and damaged grindelwald could be interested in her talents if she isn't already in and has orders as well ________________________________________________________ leta there are two options what leta's part in this could be she is a follower of grindelwald and was asked to join not only for her blood and knowledge but also for that she had a connection to theseus scamander he's a very active figure in the hunt for grindelwald who surely would like him out of the way yet killing him would not only start a riot within the ministry but also take away the option to spy on it through somebody else yet i'm not sure how that works yet he must have taken care of that she won't get any information yet once he believes she is innocent she knows exactly why theseus is trying to bond with her and feeds him information in small doses to help the other side always making sure the dark side doesn't suspect her yet what if she does that to make the ministry believe she is on their side what if once it's all revealed she secretly still follows grindelwald what if she turns away from him towards the end of the series she is aware of theseus' plan and slowly tries to turn him to the greater good ideology in very small doses so he barely notices it maybe he plays along to fullfill his role as spy but starts to question is ideals and she may be the one who came up with a romantic relationship and eventual engagement knowing he would agree to not to lose her as a source of information __________________________________ to sum it up they may both act as spies for the

1142,revisiting the wizarding world the nostalgia was almost overwhelming as i read through the first four chapters of   and the sorcerer s stone this afternoon it s been quite some time since i ve opened the pages and joined the golden trio at the three broomsticks sipping a butterbeer too long so the time has come once again this time however i thought it best to ask some questions and start a discussion regarding some things i come across in my reading which i ve listed below if you haven t read the series before i suggest not reading on as there s plenty of spoilers gt within the first chapter we come across minerva mcgonagall as first described by vernon dursley  s rather distasteful uncle he crosses paths with mcgonagall twice before we re really introduced to her as her first appearance is as a cat this is her animagus form which is a spell that allows witches and wizards to transform into animals of their choosing it s a complicated spell and not every witch or wizard has an animagi form we re given the hint that this cat that dursley sees is the same due to the markings around her eyes lt gt gt as he dursley pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw was the tabby cat he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes lt gt when dumbledore appears he also notices mcgonagall and addresses her firstly as a cat her description addresses the markings clarifying they re replaced by her glasses lt gt gt he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes lt gt it can be deduced without question that if one was to know mcgonagall s animagus form she d be easily identifiable my question is is this the case for every animagi form from my knowledge of past readings we re made aware of several other witches and wizards who are able to take animal forms but as far as i can remember the only other one we re given a more exact description of is of rita skeeter s and i believe she had distinctive markings too lt gt another question of mine to do with the markings around mcgonagall s eyes to represent her glasses is to they have significance if she is in need of glasses to see does her vision improve as a cat or does it stay the same and instead of it looking silly that a cat is wearing glasses do the markings just disguise them and provide the same visual aid that she needs lt gt gt a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching and its eyes narrowed lt gt does the narrowed eyes mean she s focusing to see if this is who she s been waiting for or do they narrow to demonstrate her focusing lt gt this is just one of the questions i ve developed so far but to keep from overloading both myself and anyone reading i ll stop here i ve posted this on my tumblr as well lt,revisit the wizard world the nostalgia wa almost overwhelm as i read through the first four chapter of   and the sorcer s stone

a cat thi is her animagu form which is a spell that allow witch and wizard to transform into anim of their choos it s a complic spell and not everi witch or wizard ha an animagi form we re given the hint that thi cat that dursley see is the same due to the mark around her eye lt gt gt as he dursley pull into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw wa the tabbi cat he wa sure it wa the same one it had the same mark around it eye lt gt when dumbledor appear he also notic mcgonagal and address her firstli as a cat her descript address the mark clarifi they re replac by her glass lt gt gt he wa smile at a rather sever look woman who wa wear squar glass exactli the shape of the mark the cat had had around it eye lt gt it can be deduc without question that if one wa to know mcgonagal s animagu form she d be easili identifi my question is is thi the case for everi animagi form from my knowledg of past read we re made awar of sever other witch and wizard who are abl to take anim form but as far as i can rememb the onli other one we re given a more exact descript of is of rita skeeter s and i believ she had distinct mark too lt gt anoth question of mine to do with the mark around mcgonagal s eye to repres her glass is to they have signific if she is in need of glass to see doe her vision improv as a cat or doe it stay the same and instead of it look silli that a cat is wear glass do the mark just disguis them and provid the same visual aid that she need lt gt gt a man appear on the corner the cat had been watch and it eye narrow lt gt doe the narrow eye mean she s focus to see if thi is who she s been wait for or do they narrow to demonstr her focus lt gt thi is just one of the question i ve develop so far but to keep from overload both myself and anyon read i ll stop here i ve post thi on my tumblr as well lt,"Revisiting the Wizarding World  The nostalgia was almost overwhelming as I read through the first four chapters of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* this afternoon. It’s been quite some time since I’ve opened the pages and joined The Golden Trio at the Three Broomsticks, sipping a butterbeer. Too long. So the time has come once again. This time, however, I thought it best to ask some questions and start a discussion regarding some things I come across in my reading, which I’ve listed below. If you haven’t read the series before, I suggest **not** reading on, as there’s plenty of spoilers.   & #   &gt;!Within the first chapter, we come across Minerva McGonagall, as first described by Vernon Dursley, Harry’s rather distasteful uncle. He crosses paths with McGonagall twice before we’re really introduced to her, as her first appearance is as a cat. This is her Animagus form, which is a spell that allows witches and wizards to transform into animals of their choosing. It’s a complicated spell and not every witch or wizard has an Animagi form. We’re given the hint that this cat that Dursley sees is the same due to the markings around her eyes. !&lt;  &gt;&gt;!“As he \[Dursley\] pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw...was the tabby cat...He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.”!&lt;  &gt;!When Dumbledore appears, he also notices McGonagall and addresses her firstly as a cat. Her description addresses the markings, clarifying they’re replaced by her glasses. !&lt;  &gt;&gt;!“...he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.”!&lt;  &gt;!It can be deduced without question that if one was to know McGonagall’s Animagus form, she’d be easily identifiable. My question is, is this the case for every Animagi form? From my knowledge of past readings, we’re made aware of several other witches and wizards who are able to take animal forms, but as far as I can remember, the only other one we’re given a more exact description of is of Rita Skeeter’s, and I believe she had distinctive markings too. !&lt;  &gt;!Another question of mine to do with the markings around McGonagall’s eyes to represent her glasses is to they have significance? If she is in need of glasses to see, does her vision improve as a cat? Or does it stay the same, and, instead of it looking silly that a cat is wearing glasses, do the markings just disguise them and provide the same visual aid that she needs? !&lt;  &gt;&gt;!“A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching...and its eyes narrowed.”!&lt;  &gt;!Does the narrowed eyes mean she’s focusing to see if this is who she’s been waiting for? Or do they narrow to demonstrate her focusing? !&lt;  &gt;!This is just one of the questions I’ve developed so far, but to keep from overloading both myself and anyone reading, I’ll stop here. I’ve posted this on my Tumblr as well. !&lt;"

Let me explain  There several possibilities of that:     1). We didn't see what happened between the scenes on the sinking ship. Maybe Corvus' nanny/mother grabbed the wrong baby by mistake while descending to the boat ? Not the first time she didn't notice it wasn't her baby. Maybe she even noticed it wasn't hers, and took another baby who looked more like hers. We only see Leta in another boat assuming there was her brother in another rescue boat, there were probably more than two ?     2). Magic children tend to magically save themselves at young age in dangerous situations, even if they don't know they are wizards/witches. Harry did that running away from Dudley and the bullies. Now, ok corvus would be only 1 year old, but if he is Credence, then he was born extremely powerful. He is somehow exception from all the rules (like that obscurials don't live that long, Credence lives already twice as long as he should have. Maybe baby Corvus apparated into a safe boat, because he was drawning, he was found by someone and given to Barebone.      That all would be so dramatic, considering Leta blemed herself he whole life ..."

never knew you could be such a smooth talker”, she panted, finally done with the buttons. His abdomen was surprisingly strong. She felt she couldn’t get enough of touching him. How did he get such strong abs?  Meanwhile Snape's hands had roamed down to her thighs and found the wand belt, which he unceremoniously teared off. Then he found the jackpot. Hermione screamed as he started to touch her through her lace panties.  “If you don’t stop squirming I’m going to have to tie you to this table, miss Granger” Snape drawled, and Hermione nearly came just from the sound of his voice. How had she never noticed how sexy professor Snape’s voice was?  She couldn’t take the teasing anymore. Blindly she groped for his fly.  “Shut up, and use your wand, professor. Or I will have to report you.”  With a short chuckle Snape undid his fly and belt, pulled down his trousers, parted her underwear to the side and with a powerful thrust he was inside of her. Hermione threw her head back and moaned loudly.  “Excellent use of your wand, sir.” “Shut up, Granger”, he panted and started thrusting, bending down to kiss her at the same time. Hermione moaned into his mouth and grabbed his shoulders for leverage. She felt like she had never been so full in her life.

He cursed under his breath, and swiftly pulled out of her, making her wince from the sudden loss. He tucked himself in, and wandlessly dressed himself. Within seconds he was standing there fully dressed as if nothing had happened, while she was still on the bench with her legs spread. She quickly closed them, suddenly embarrassed about the situation they found themselves in.  “I’ll go out and distract him while you, ah, get yourself decent”, he whispered, clearly not making eye contact with her. She blushed furiously as he strode out of the classroom.  “Oy, Snape”, Hermione heard Ron shout as Snape opened the door. “Have you seen Hermione?”  “As a matter of fact, I have”, she heard Snape answer. “She told me to give you her regards.”  There was a crack and a loud thud, and then silence. Without thinking Hermione ran for the door, only to find Ron unconscious outside, and Snape nowhere in sight. Ron already had a black eye that was swelling up by the second.  She couldn’t help but smile as she dropped Ron’s wand on top of him, then walked away."

But thanks for all the answers in correcting me. I’d like to thank u/franzman86 for all the corrections. Also, thanks to the person who messaged me (who wishes to remain anonymous) about the British ‘CPS’ system. And to the one person who downvoted me, I would like to know why! I spend a lot of time on these, and I want to improve. If these are garbage, please tell that they are, and how I can fix them! Oh, and this one doesn’t make much sense and is pretty short. Wonderful, I know.  *Mistakes I made from the last chapter:* * Apparently you can start High-School in Britain at age eleven (birthday being before or on September 1st). That’s awesome, by the way. * Guns can be effective against wizards. * The CPS system in the 90s was awful and they rarely did anything. I’m glad it’s better now.  *Book:* Philosopher’s Stone, British Version  *Chapter:* 4, The Keeper of the Keys  *Synopsis:* The moment Harry Potter turns eleven, a large man by the name of Hagrid comes to rescue him from the Dursley’s. Here it is discovered that Harry is a wizard, destined to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ironically, in this world, he is famous, everyone knows his name. After the Dursley’s try and fail to keep him in the dark, Harry joins the half-giant to gather his school supplies.  *Reactions from u/Wither_Fire:* * This chapter is the first time someone tells Harry that he looks like his father, but he has his fathers eyes. I’m starting a counter. COUNTER: 1 * This really is an exposition counter. But to a person who would have read this for the first time, fascinating! * We learn of Hagrid’s backstory, and he hasn’t even gotten to the school yet. Wow, J.K. Rowling, already setting up Chamber of Secrets. * Hagrid tries to turn Dudley into a pig, but only manages to put on a tail, saying that he already looked enough like one already. Harry said this a few chapters ago. The author is brilliant at this, giving each character a unique sentence describing their physical appearance. Umbridge is toad like, and Snape has a hooked nose. Trelawny is described by her glasses. Because of this description, when Harry sees the prophecy and recounts a faint image of a woman with large round glasses, we know it’s her. We later on instable know someone by a recurring physical trait. I don’t know if this makes sense or not to anyone else. Oh well (I’m bad at explaining things). * Albus Dumbledore has many titles, one of them being ‘Supreme Mugwump’. Now, what the heck is that? Some sort of Supreme Chancellor (smiles in Sheev)? * Hagrid keeps an owl in his pocket. Shouldn’t this count somehow as animal abuse? * Harry gets his first cake! But in the book, it is spelled correctly. * Hagrid mentions that Voldemort kills the McKinnons (Marlene McKinnon), the Bones (Susan and her mother), and the Prewetts. Wasn’t Molly Weasley’s madden name Prewett? Which makes her two twin brothers Prewetts, too. So Fabian (and the other one who I forgot the name, begins with a G) died by the hands of Voldemort. Also, on another note, she named Fred and George after the initials of her brothers. * A lot of the dialogue in the movie matches up with the ones from the book here, in this chapter. * I love how the letter Harry gets is labeled *The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea*. Wasn’t the hut in the Black Sea? Why wasn’t this more specific? Also, *The Floor*."

Then, he brought it IN the bath with him. And when he dropped it did he just grab it with his hands- no. He struck his head in the water which THEN caused him to hear the singing. Idk- it’s just a funny thought I had at around 2am when I was delusional and tired."

Harry then makes a comment that she shouldn't talk about his parents like that. But Petunia never responds. Then in the Prince's Tale we see Snape telling Lily about Azkaban with Petunia eavesdropping.   So, contrary to what we were led to believe, was the awful boy Snape? Or do we just assume that she later heard James telling Lily again when they were older?  It never quite clicked in my head before that Petunia must remember Snape! I wonder what her reaction would have been if she had a little more interest in Harry and realised Snape was one of his teachers."

699,snape and the incel culture i have a huge problem with people labeling snape as an incel look i don't even like his character or think he was a good guy but imo it's important to clarify things

sorry to disappoint you guys but snape never showed any of those traits in canon never every time he's verbally abusive to a woman it's because he's either a bigot or because he hates  friends snape was a dick to everyone regardless of their gender he didn't target women specifically the only things snape had in common with incels was his ugliness and a woman who never reciprocated his feelings if had any but that's not the point of my post do we have any proof in canon that snape has ever been sexually attracted to anyone in his life anyway i'm convinced that when people say that snape was an incel they mean that he was impossible to love because of his terrible personality and looks and i'm also pretty sure that not every man who's impossible to love has to be an incel not every man who likes a woman who doesn't love them back is an incel either maybe find another word to describe him a ghoul lmao incel doesn't fit to snape's character it's a term people use loosely these days

It’s specially evident when they go from the archives to the cemetery. They have barely finished with the creepy cats and suddenly they’re in a different location like nothing happened. The whole edit is filled with quick jumps and the pace of the movie suffers from that.  Also, there’re like 4 or 5 different scenes that were shown in the trailer and didn’t make it in the final cut.

Check out this excerpt:  &gt;Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carriedknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.  I suppose Harry thought, in a quiet moment, ""Aw, shucks, Dudley is gonna whack me all over the place with that stick."" Little did Harry know that the school he would soon attend *also* required their pupils to carry sticks – albeit ones that could do much more than just hit people. And, needless to say, using these ""sticks"" at school (sometimes against each other) was also good training for later in life.  JKR, you did it again!"

The most important: one they showed us young Newt' holding a raven chick for a reason. Actually for two reasons: we can see it's the same bird that Credence found. And second, it is said that the raven is a symbol of the Lestrange family  2). Grindelwald is incredibly talented in transfiguration. At the beginning of the film he was using transfiguration, not the polyjuice potion (officially confirmed) to change looks with Abernathy for a quite long period, before the tongue was cut off, so he could possibly make a raven look like a phoenix.  3). Yusuf still has scars from Unbreakable vow, so Corvus is possibly still alive.  4). Corvus Sr. and GG knew each other, that's how GG learned about his identity. That's why they stole Lestrange family Tree and modified it, and they killed Irma Dugard.   5). GG is almost always lying and would do anything to kill Dumbledore  6). Corvus Lestrange was shown as the last male Lestrange at the family tree, but we know that Lestrange continued to exist  So my thoughts are that the babies were double swapped, it means, they were swapped first before they went to the ship, because they were aware that Yusuf would try to kill them. Only the woman who was looking after real Corvus, knew that it actually is him, but she died as well. The baby who was with Leta and Irma was crying all the time because he was a random kidnapped baby, who didn't know anyone around him"

this took some detective work and tons of connecting the dots first of all there's a church in godric hallow and the  were buried in the church's graveyard so i'd say there were at the very least semi frequent church goers/members second the fact that the afterlife is not only touched on but also a reality seems to indicate that some level of heaven/afterlife is present this would rule out the entirely naturalistic/scientific worldview if magic itself did not rule it out before lol third christmas is celebrated maybe this is more of a cultural thing but apparently its one of the few cultural holidays other cultural holidays seem to be valentines which is a catholic saint's death anniversary new year halloween and easter in dh the chapter malfoy manor takes place during the easter holidays narcissa malfoy specifically says draco is home from hogwarts on his easter holiday except for new year this are entirely religious holidays i know that all of them have turned into cultural holidays but if you see the red/green color combination for christmas is not used this combination was associated with christmas first in the victorian era england ie  even if this was a muggle thing  years is enough for  colors to bleed to hogwarts i mean jeans and hoodies did this would indicate that they celebrate it not as a  cultual thing for muggle born and half bloods also why would the malfoys celebrate easter if they were not at least christian wizards after all christmas is super cultural but easter not so much at least in my country only christians call it easter holidays non christian call it turism week instead of holy week sure maybe the malfoys dont but hogwarts seems to and this could be maybe cultural but for example there's no indication that festivities like burns night scotland jan  are celebrated based on this only christian holidays seem to be observed/mentioned so at the very least there are either christian wizards or christian seeming wizards no idea on other religions i would not say that in the hp world chrisitanity is true per se and that there's a strictly christian heaven and hell but there appears that there is not only a heaven like place but also some form of hell or torturous afterlife too ie for people who have split their souls like voldemort this is inconclusive but at least for me there seems to be evidence for religious wizards we cant avoid the strongly christian imagery all across the series anyways also if you lived in a world were magic ghosts vampires etc exists why would you disqualify a god from existing sure maybe doing wizardry would seem counter productive for a christian/muslim/jew as they all forbid it but i mean lying cheating porn and pre marital sex is also strongly banned yet people indulge in it freely so i dont see it as such a big issue again lets not discuss the merits of religion just the existence or not of religious wizards lets be civil guys this is a touchy subject and there's no benefit in

1858,i am starting to get annoyed about how people view ravenclaws let me explain in almost every discussion about house traits everyone always just seems to expect ravenclaws to be the ones that get housepoints for beeing smart in class and having all the answers i thinks thats not true in my view ravenclaws would rather be the ones that don t make their homework how they supposed to but rather getting cought up in something mildly relatet to what they were actually supposed to look up in the library for example they were told to look up all the ingredients for a potion but instead they look up one of the ingredients one day and find it so fascinating that they forget the rest and just focus on that one ingredient because it s so interesting to learn about all the properties in my opinion that s more how a ravenclaws mind works general interest in learnig not for having all the correct answers but for the learning itself for cumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge not to brag about it i also think that in every house there are the ones that are very studious and good in class and others that are interestet in other things than being the best student in their class any ravenclaws here to confirm my theory or are there ravenclaws out there who totally do not agree with me i d like to know if it s just me who thinks that ravenclaws are actually not that booksmart intelligent yes but in a think outside the box way and with intrinsic motivation to open their horizon,i am start to get annoy about how peopl view ravenclaw let me explain in almost everi discuss about hous trait everyon alway just seem to expect ravenclaw to be the one that get housepoint for bee smart in class and have all the answer i think that not true in my view ravenclaw would rather be the one that don t make their homework how they suppos to but rather get cought up in someth mildli relatet to what they were actual suppos to look up in the librari for exampl they were told to look up all the ingredi for a potion but instead they look up one of the ingredi one day and find it so fascin that they forget the rest and just focu on that one ingredi becaus it s so interest to learn about all the properti in my opinion that s more how a ravenclaw mind work gener interest in learnig not for have all the correct answer but for the learn itself for cumul knowledg for the sake of knowledg not to brag about it i also think that in everi hous there are the one that are veri studiou and good in class and other that are interestet in other thing than be the best student in their class ani ravenclaw here to confirm my theori or are there ravenclaw out there who total do not agre with me i d like to know if it s just me who think that ravenclaw are actual not that booksmart intellig ye but in a think outsid the box way and with intrins motiv to open their horizon,i am start to get annoy about how peopl view ravenclaw let me explain in almost everi discuss about hous trait everyon alway just seem to expect ravenclaw to be the one that get housepoint for bee smart in class and have all the answer i think that not true in my view ravenclaw would rather be the one that don t make their homework how they suppos to but rather get cought up in someth mildli relatet to what they were actual suppos to look up in the librari for exampl they were told to look up all the ingredi for a potion but instead they look up one of the ingredi one day and find it so fascin that they forget the rest and just focu on that one ingredi becaus it s so interest to learn about all the properti in my opinion that s more how a ravenclaw mind work gener interest in learnig not for have all the correct answer but for the learn itself for cumul knowledg for the sake of knowledg not to brag about it i also think that in everi hous there are the one that are veri studiou and good in class and other that are interestet in other thing than be the best student in their class ani ravenclaw here to confirm my theori or are there ravenclaw out there who total do not agre with me i d like to know if it s just me who think that ravenclaw are actual not that booksmart intellig ye but in a think outsid the box way and with intrins motiv to open their horizon,"I am starting to get annoyed about how people view Ravenclaws Let me explain: In almost every discussion about house traits, everyone always just seems to expect Ravenclaws to be the ones that get housepoints for beeing smart in class and having all the answers.   I thinks thats not true. In my view Ravenclaws would rather be the ones that don‘t make their homework how they supposed to, but rather getting cought up in something mildly relatet to what they were actually supposed to look up in the library. For example they were told to look up all the ingredients for a potion. But instead they look up one of the ingredients one day and find it so fascinating that they forget the rest and just focus on that one ingredient because it’s so interesting to learn about all the properties. In my opinion that’s more how a Ravenclaws mind works. General interest in learnig not for having all the correct answers but for the learning itself, for cumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge not to brag about it.  (I also think that in every house there are the ones that are very studious and good in class and others that are interestet in other things than being the best student in their class.)  Any Ravenclaws here to confirm my theory? Or are there Ravenclaws out there who totally do not agree with me. I‘d like to know if it‘s just me who thinks that Ravenclaws are actually not that booksmart. Intelligent - yes - but in a „think outside the box“-way and with intrinsic motivation to „open their horizon“"

Leta later uses that family tree to convince Credence that he’s not a Lestrange, and that Corvus V died because of her actions.   It’s been shown that Leta was prone to dark magic, and infers later that Newt always can see the good in monsters. I think that Leta may have been in league with Grindewald and intentionally pushed the narrative that Credence wasn’t Corvus to further Grindewald’s goal of using Credence to kill Dumbledore.   Why else would they show Grindewald’s minions placing the family tree there?   I know some of you guys are insane when it comes to this, so try to keep it civil."

can't expect other writers to conform to your ways of doing things and complain when they choose to write a story that's more attuned to their own culture and sense of familiarity and honestly don't

The cool thing about America is it's traditionally been very multicultural, unlike most nations of the old world. So, as we saw in the first FB movie, many more ethnic groups besides just Europeans were represented. There wasn't anything weird about seeing a black president in that movie, because black people have almost always been here, and were certainly here in the 1920s.   My advice to those who are upset about lack of representation for their own people is this: write a fanfiction depicting wizards in a historically accurate context. Or, better yet, make up your own series set in your own homeland. It's perfectly fine to do that.

As a white woman, how can she, in good conscience, claim to understand the experiences of those from a different background enough to write a believable (even though fictional) story about it? I've found that cultures are best represented by the people to whom they belong. So, again, if you want to see yourself represented in a wizarding story, go right ahead and write one, because you're probably the best person for the job anyway. Just set the story in an appropriate setting if you want it to be even somewhat realistic. Don't go placing thousands of Mongolians in 19th century Idaho, for instance."

2854,i finally sat down and watched crimes of grindelwald and i have mixed feelings about it that i really wanted to share spoilers inside ofc so i want to get the negative stuff out of the way first and then i'll get to the good stuff cause i'd like to end this with a positive note also i'm on mobile and english is not my first language please do point out any mistake you find tldr at the bottom cause it's a longer post than expected costumes this was honestly the most annoyng part of the movie for me i could understand them in the first movie since our beloved hufflepuff was trying to blend in with muggles and maybe american wizards just dress normally who knows but i just could not buy them in this movie albus dumbledore dressing like a muggle muggles hating purebloods dressing like muggles french wizards dressing like mudbloods lestrange wizards dressing like mudbloods it was honestly the most distracting and annoying part of the movie for me nagini why was this necessary maledictus are a cool concept i like cruel inevitability in a character's destiny but why nagini just give her another name she seems like a character that could be interesting if well done but knowing she is the hateful snake that killed the riddle's mansion gardener and killed snape and served voldemort just makes her automatically uninteresting for me also she seems to hate purebloods but then she is fine being by voldemort's side does she loses her humanity when becoming a snake credence dumbledore's brother really why the idea of him just being some powerful mage who could've been born out of a muggle family could have been so fascinating the fate of the entire magical world decided by the son of a muggle family such a powerful idea but no he's part of one of the most famous wizard family in the world the whole boat ordeal ok this is just a gigantic plothole first of all the lestrange family with branches all over europe and has houses and power all over the continent decide that most secure place for a full pureblood wizard is america with an halfelf hybrid because of one boy who wants to kill him wtf literally just gang up on the guy kill him before he even finds out where you live cast a fidelius spell on your hideout put out a reward for his head so many different things could have been done and sending him away from their influence with an hybrid being definitely sounds stupid then on the same boat there's a secret dumbledore heir which by logic is a fourth son of dumbledore's father he seems to be much younger than dumbledore maybe   years wasn't dumbledore's father at azkaban at that point and even if he wasn't we know he loved his family over any doubt he literally gave up on his life over the anger he felt for what the muggle kids had done to ariana but he had a secret affair with someone and sent them to america by boat why not any other magical means this whole thing is so forced it completely ruined the twist that tina was the one responsible for her brother death fawkes so let's just strip away one of the coolest thing that dumbledore had going for himself being worthy of a fucking phoenix and let's just say it's a family heirloom sure such a genious move congrats i hate it hogwarts how can you make hogwarts look boring maybe that's not the right word but the place just looks so not magical it looked so plain how do you even manage to do that i grew up with the books and the movies and hogwarts always had this strange and whimsical aura but in this movie it just looks like a normal boring school let's talk about positives now queenie i loved her arc in this movie she just wants to love whoever she wants she just wants to be free and grindelwald ideas are so appealing to her from the get go she is obviously used to emphasise how manipulative grindelwald really is and how absurdly suffocating the rules of the magical world must be for someone like queenie i think she may very well become an anti snape type of character turning evil because of love instead of turning good but i am really afraid that they're going to fuck this up and just make her redeem herself which in my opinion would be the most boring ending to her arc tina she is a really interesting character she is a slytherin but not an evil person granted she murdered her own baby brother but then she just sacrifices herself to save newt's brother i can't remember his name sorry so many characters in this movie in the end they leave us with the doubt that her final i love you was directed to newt and i hate that but generally her character left a good impression on me newt i think he's great honestly i have a soft spot for these kind of quirky/weird characters absolutely loved his interactions with his brother but i don't think he got too much character development in this movie except for the i picked a side thing which i don't think makes much sense he obviously is against grindelwald ideas from the start of the movie nicholas flamel loved him tbh i was so happy he was being introduced as a character and the idea that his immortality is not eternal youth got me laughing a bit he does prove to be a really powerful wizard by the end of the movie and i hope he'll be important in future plots as well jude law as dumbledore his acting was on point i think thay just didn't give him much to work with but i liked most scenes with him although he doesn't seem to age at all between newt's generation and the present of the movie which was a bit weird to me grindelwald i liked him he probably had the only remotely wizard like costume he came off as ruthless and manipulative and incredibly powerful am i the only one who thought the eye make up was weird it was super distracting for me during the scenes he was in   i mostly enjoied the cg except the familiars in the ministry they looked remarkably fake and most of the creatures looked interesting even though they were not a big focus in the movie the big cat thingy was cute i think that's all that came out longer than i expected thank you if you read all of that d tldr bad things costumes nagini credence fucking boat travel fawkes hogwarts good

fawk hogwart good thing queeni tina newt nichola flamel grindelwald  ,"I finally sat down and watched ""Crimes of Grindelwald"" and I have mixed feelings about it that I really wanted to share (spoilers inside ofc) So I want to get the negative stuff out of the way first, and then I'll get to the good stuff, cause I'd like to end this with a positive note :) (also I'm on mobile and English is not my first language, please do point out any mistake you find)  TLDR at the bottom, cause it's a longer post than expected.   Costumes This was honestly the most annoyng part of the movie for me, I could understand them in the first movie since our beloved hufflepuff was trying to blend in with muggles, and maybe American wizards just dress normally, who knows. But I just could not buy them in this movie, Albus Dumbledore dressing like a muggle? Muggles-hating purebloods dressing like muggles? FRENCH WIZARDS DRESSING LIKE MUDBLOODS? LESTRANGE WIZARDS DRESSING LIKE MUDBLOODS? it was honestly the most distracting and annoying part of the movie for me.  Nagini Why was this necessary? Maledictus are a cool concept: I like cruel inevitability in a character's destiny, but WHY NAGINI? Just give her another name she seems like a character that could be interesting if well done, but knowing she is the hateful snake that killed the riddle's mansion gardener and killed Snape AND served Voldemort just makes her automatically uninteresting for me. Also she seems to hate purebloods but then she is fine being by voldemort's side? Does she loses her humanity when becoming a snake?  Credence DUMBLEDORE'S BROTHER? REALLY? WHY? The idea of him just being some powerful mage who could've been born out of a muggle family could have been so fascinating! The fate of the entire magical world decided by the son of a muggle family? Such a powerful idea! But no, he's part of one of the most famous wizard family in the world. :(  The whole boat ordeal Ok, this is just a gigantic plothole. First of all the lestrange family, with branches all over Europe, and has houses and power all over the continent decide that most secure place for a full pureblood wizard is America with an HALFELF HYBRID, because of ONE boy who wants to kill him? Wtf? Literally just gang up on the guy, kill him before he even finds out where you live, cast a fidelius spell on your hideout, put out a reward for his head! So many different things could have been done and sending him away from their influence with an hybrid being definitely sounds stupid. Then ON THE SAME BOAT there's a secret dumbledore heir which, by logic, is a fourth son of dumbledore's father, he seems to be much younger than dumbledore, maybe 6-7 years? Wasn't dumbledore's father AT AZKABAN AT THAT POINT? and even if he wasn't, we know he loved his family over any doubt, he literally gave up on his life over the anger he felt for what the muggle kids had done to Ariana, but he had a secret affair with someone and sent them to America BY BOAT? why not ANY OTHER MAGICAL MEANS? This whole thing is so forced it completely ruined the twist that Tina was the one responsible for her brother death.  Fawkes So let's just strip away one of the coolest thing that dumbledore had going for himself, being worthy of a fucking phoenix and let's just say it's a family heirloom, sure.  Such a genious move.  Congrats, I hate it.   Hogwarts How can you make hogwarts look... Boring? Maybe that's not the right word, but the place just looks so... Not magical. It looked so.... Plain, how do you even manage to do that? I grew up with the books and the movies, and hogwarts always had this strange and whimsical aura, but in this movie? It just looks like a normal, boring school.   Let's talk about positives now   Queenie I LOVED her arc in this movie. She just wants to love whoever she wants, she just wants to be free, and Grindelwald ideas are so appealing to her from the get go. She is obviously used to emphasise how manipulative Grindelwald really is, and how absurdly suffocating the rules of the magical world must be for someone like Queenie. I think she may very well become an ""anti-snape"" type of character, turning evil because of love, instead of turning good,but I am really afraid that they're going to fuck this up and just make her redeem herself, which, in my opinion, would be the most boring ending to her arc.  Tina She is a really interesting character, she is a Slytherin but not an evil person, granted she murdered her own baby brother but then she just sacrifices herself to save newt's brother (I can't remember his name sorry, so many characters in this movie!) , in the end they leave us with the doubt that her final ""I love you"" was directed to Newt, and I hate that, but generally her character left a good impression on me.  Newt I think he's great honestly, I have a soft spot for these kind of quirky/weird characters, absolutely loved his interactions with his brother, but I don't think he got too much character development in this movie except for the ""I picked a side"" thing, which I don't think makes much sense, he obviously is against grindelwald ideas from the start of the movie.  Nicholas flamel Loved him tbh, I was so happy he was being introduced as a character, and the idea that his immortality is not eternal youth got me laughing a bit. He does prove to be a really powerful wizard by the end of the movie, and I hope he'll be important in future plots as well.  Jude law as Dumbledore His acting was on point I think, thay just didn't give him much to work with, but I liked most scenes with him, although he doesn't seem to age at all between newt's generation and the present of the movie, which was a bit weird to me.  Grindelwald I liked him. He probably had the only remotely ""wizard-like"" costume, he came off as ruthless and manipulative and incredibly powerful. Am I the only one who thought the eye make-up was weird? It was super distracting for me during the scenes he was in.  Fantastic beasts. I mostly enjoied the CG (except the familiars in the ministry they looked remarkably fake) and most of the creatures looked interesting, even though they were not a big focus in the movie. The big cat thingy was cute :)  I think that's all, that came out longer than I expected, thank you if you read all of that :D  TLDR: Bad things: costumes, nagini, credence, FUCKING BOAT TRAVEL, fawkes, Hogwarts Good things: Queenie, Tina, Newt, Nicholas Flamel, Grindelwald, Fantastic beasts."

2673,my theory/predictions about queenie's fate in future fb films my theory/hope for queenie's fate in future films is for her to have an arch similar to edmund pevensie in the lion the witch the wardrobe a family member and close ally of the main protagonists seduced to join/support the enemy and eventually realizes they've made a mistake and rejoins the heros here's how i see things playing out fb  throughout this film queenie will struggle with the choice she's made and eventually realize she's chosen the wrong side perhaps some of the things she is expected to do for the cause become too much her she will then attempt to rejoin the main gang either at the end of this film or more likely in my opinion the start/middle of the next film fb  queenie is attempting to rejoin the heros again however they are obviously distrustfull of her maybe she tries to stall for time to work against grindelwald from the inside for a while and when the heros find out this is what makes them slowly start to trust her again regardless queenie has towards this films end completely left grindelwald's side to rejoin the heros depending on the the severity of actions she may or may not have commited in grindelwald's name the authorites may want her locked up or maybe even executed thus having the film end with queenie imprisoned or on the run but secretly working with the some members of themain group who may not completely trust her yet but are at least willing to give her a chance at redemption fb  if queenie was on the run at the end of the last film she will still be at the start of this one if queenie was imprisoned at the end of the last film events will transpire to get her out at least before the end of the first act she will then proceed as if she had just been on the run queenie spends this film secretly working with the main gang slowly gaining back their trust and rekindeling her relationship with jacob she then massively helps somehow with whatever final events take place at the very end however i see four possible outcomes gt  she dies in a death equals redemtion kinda way leaving jacob hearbroken gt  she lives and is either given a ligher sentence for helping bring down grindelwald perhaps been banned from performing magic a short time in jail or whatever or she is pardoned outright eitherway this ending sees her getting together with jacob and they can finally get married legally and happy ending and all that yay gt  same as ending  she is pardoned or given a lighter punishment but jacob dies leaving queenie heartbroken gt  both jacob queenie die leaving newt and tina sad over the loss of their best friend and sister respectively personally i believe ending  or  are the most likely outcome given rowling's track record but since i'm such a sucker for sentimental solutions i'm really hoping for ending  as unlikely as it is jacob and queenie were just too precious in the first film to waste i'm still rooting for these two and hoping that rowling is not gonna go on a final installment killing spree again those are my predictions at least agree/disagree what are your thoughts i'll end this by saying that despite the popular

Sure Grindelwald is a liar, and sometimes he even gets stuff wrong, but ending a whole movie with a random lie would just be illogical. * So Percival Dumbledore has to be Credence's father. Based on Credence's age and the established timeline, Credence would have to have been conceived after Percival was sent to Azkaban. * So logically, Percival fathered Credence/Aurelius while at Azkaban.  Not sure how this is possible, but the circumstances of it must have been strange enough that a decision was taken to send the baby by boat to America. And in a way it would sort of make sense for Grindelwald to know about this wayward Dumbledore child even though most other people don't: Grindelwald is kind of a dark guy who probably knows various other evil characters who could probably find out about it if a child were somehow conceived at Azkaban.  Beyond that, I don't know what to say. Hard to imagine exactly \*how\* or \*why\* old Percival would be fathering children in a wizard prison. But as far as I can tell, that's the only answer that makes any sense at all."

Newt &  Tina want to protect him, Grindelwald wants to use him, Dumbledore also wants to protect him (does Albus know? That he's his brother?), Yusef er... wants to kill him, Leta... not sure what her motivations are, other than she was following Newt at the time. *Every* magical government wants him!   Why are all the magical governments suddenly so interested in a young man that previously nobody took any notice of?  Why is Credence suddenly the hot potato that literally all the main characters want to get a piece of? I know he's an obscurial - and he's magically very powerful, but why is everyone so drawn to him? Literally the entire plot would collapse if you remove his character from the second film."

3512,yet another credence theory alright i know these are dime a dozen and everyone has their own far fetched theory on how jk will make the timeline work but here goes so it s obvious gg s obsession with an obscurials probably came from his encounters with ariana so what if ariana didn t die if she managed to escape the fight similarly to how credence escaped at the end of fbawtft  she would have been  when the boat sank in leta s memory killing the real corvus she easily could have spent that time learning how to control and manage her obscurial like credence did she also would have been plenty old to have an infant aurelius or he s actually corvus and gg is lying again either or,yet anoth credenc theori alright i know these are dime a dozen and everyon ha their own far fetch theori on how jk will make the timelin work but here goe so it s obviou gg s obsess with an obscuri probabl came from hi encount with ariana so what if ariana didn t die if she manag to escap the fight similarli to how credenc escap at the end of fbawtft  she would have been  when the boat sank in leta s memori kill the real corvu she easili could have spent that time learn how to control and manag her obscuri like credenc did she also would have been plenti old to have an infant aureliu or he s actual corvu and gg is lie again either or,yet anoth credenc theori alright i know these are dime a dozen and everyon ha their own far fetch theori on how jk will make the timelin work but here goe so it s obviou gg s obsess with an obscuri probabl came from hi encount with ariana so what if ariana didn t die if she manag to escap the fight similarli to how credenc escap at the end of fbawtft  she would have been  when the boat sank in leta s memori kill the real corvu she easili could have spent that time learn how to control and manag her obscuri like credenc did she also would have been plenti old to have an infant aureliu or he s actual corvu and gg is lie again either or,"Yet another Credence theory. Alright I know these are dime a dozen and everyone has their own far fetched theory on how JK will make the timeline work but here goes.   So it’s obvious GG’s obsession with an obscurials probably came from his encounters with Ariana. So what if Ariana didn’t die?  If she managed to escape the fight similarly to how Credence escaped at the end of FBAWTFT #1, she would have been 23 when the boat sank in Leta’s memory, killing the real Corvus. She easily could have spent that time learning how to control and manage her Obscurial like Credence did. She also would have been plenty old to have an infant, Aurelius.  Or he’s actually Corvus and GG is lying again. Either or."

140,what are some nice translations from the books in your language i'm fond of some of the dutch translations for example horcruxes is a non existent word but the dutch translation is gruzielementen which is great because the word for soul is 'ziel' when something is shattered to pieces it's in gruzelementen so they combined gruzelementen with ziel making it mean something like pieces of a shattered soul which perfectly describes it and it's very close to an actual word i think they outdid themselves there in terms of translation but maybe other languages have such great finds as well,what are some nice translat from the book in your languag i'm fond of some of the dutch translat for exampl horcrux is a non exist word but the dutch translat is gruzielementen which is great becaus the word for soul is 'ziel' when someth is shatter to piec it' in gruzelementen so they combin gruzelementen with ziel make it mean someth like piec of a shatter soul which perfectli describ it and it' veri close to an actual word i think they outdid themselv there in term of translat but mayb other languag have such great find as well,what are some nice translat from the book in your languag i'm fond of some of the dutch translat for exampl horcrux is a non exist word but the dutch translat is gruzielementen which is great becaus the word for soul is 'ziel' when someth is shatter to piec it' in gruzelementen so they combin gruzelementen with ziel make it mean someth like piec of a shatter soul which perfectli describ it and it' veri close to an actual word i think they outdid themselv there in term of translat but mayb other languag have such great find as well,"What are some nice translations from the books in your language?

You know how it works.  **Theseus:** Why?  **Newt:** I wanted to study it. And … wanted to show someone else there was nothing to fear.  **Theseus:** Indeed?  **Newt:** It went wrong. I should have known. And I can’t forgive myself… I deserve what they -  **Theseus:** Shut .. up.  **Newt:** What?  **Theseus:** Most of the teachers don’t seem to understand when someone is lying to their face, but I know you.

He was powerful, demented, and extremely selfish. He treats his followers terribly, and all who join him, fear him and seek to please him out of that fear. And in a villain, those things are intimidating and awful, but not terrifying or lasting.  Grindelwald is power hungry, sure, but he is fighting for a greater purpose and has a plan to remake the world. We know he is capable of love and friendship, and he treats his followers and potential followers as a family. His lies are subtle, his methods thought out, clever, and meticulous. He does not rule in power, but in building a movement. The only ones who fear him are those who directly oppose him.   I would make the argument, that Voldemort is a inferior villain to Grindlewald. And while Voldemort’s reign of terror was awful, the ideas that Grindlewald championed outlasted him and his followers.   This is why when Grindlewald taunts Voldemort in the Book, you get a sense of how small Voldemort is as a man. Grindlewald goes to his death with confidence and cleverness, while Voldemort is terrified of it.  I hope we get this scene again at the end of the FB films. Because it was a throw away scene in the 7th movie."

I know he was distraught because of what had happened and didn't care at all for the prize at all.  But those 1000 galleons was a major major boost to the twins shop. What's more is that he never bragged about it to anyone how HE was the one who made the Joke Shop possible. Cheers to his wonderful nature.

I’m a Canadian fan, so I grew up reading the Canadian editions of the books which are identical to the British versions in content and cover image. I was not really big into audiobooks as a kid because my mum always read to me.  But as an adult I have some issues sleeping and no longer have a mother in my house who can read to me. My genius solution was to get the audiobook copies of the books I’ve read at least 5 times (Harry Potter, obviously) to lull me to sleep. Then it doesn’t matter if I fall asleep and miss something as I know the story well, and I get the added benefit of feeling a warm familiar hug from all the nostalgia and memories.  It worked great until I was about half asleep following along to Book 1 chapter 1 and Baby Dudley learned the word “won’t” instead of the word “shan’t”. I was jarred awake so hard and had a good panic as I realized that I in fact had a copy of the SS audiobook and there was no way for me to acquire the PS version on iTunes, or amazon, or wherever without some significant computer magic of which I am not capable.  All I want is Stephen Fry’s voice reading me to sleep with the books of my childhood. I would happily acquire these thing through legal means with an exchange of money, but I have clearly missed the opportunity to do this within Canada.  Any other Canadians having this issue? Can we start a petition or something? Send help? Condolences? Chocolate?"

3933,myrtle's murder fb/hp theory hello people in one of my previous theories i stated that we may get to see hagrid being expelled from hogwarts since it fits into the timeline and newt had a part in it yet i wondered how hagrid was expelled because if we look closely at how the case of myrtle s murder there is actually a lot of hints that needed to be covered so tom riddle wouldn t be suspect any longer so enjoy _____________________________________________________________________________ the corpse i already said that newt may be called to the scene/the ministries forensic department to examine the corpse as an expert for magical creatures so what will he see when myrtle was killed there were no physical bruises leave alone a bitemark so either her corpse was left the way it was or tom riddle talented as he was faked the biting marks i do wonder about where he would get fangs from an acromantula from we know he had a good relationship with horace slughorn that time so despite that acromantula poison is very seldom but there is a way how all of this fits together and that is tom riddles magical power and the ability to change memories _______________________________________________ a perfect murder so tom riddle is all alone the basilisk just killed a student he is standing before her corpse this was unintentional and he knows what will happen if he is seen and he has an idea or was prepared already getting aragog how exactly did he know about the acromantula hagrid was hiding i don t know for sure but i believe he found out about him and decided not to tell professor dibbet in case he would need him some day yes i believe tom riddle already prepared himself for an occuring murder since he could call and talk to the basilisk already and knew what it was capable of yet i m not sure if he really wanted to kill someone back then since hogwarts was his only home maybe he already wanted to point the blame towards aragog and stop the murders once he was killed so what if he quickly leaves after the murder and seals the door briefly he then goes for the closet the spider is in puts it under an imperius curse and we know it s possible hides it in his school bag with a room spreading spell _________________________________________ back at the toilet he goes back to the toilet tells aragog to bite the corpse and then can he make the poison going through her blood system because even if a trained magic forensic will still find that this wasn t the cause of her death but we don t know if one could tell in  certainly spells and magic need to be evolved and developed as well over time so he returns aragog to the closet and changes his memories so he doesn t recall the situation he had to flee soon and even if he had claimed that he didn t kill the girl who would believe a monstrous spider able to kill humans returning to the toilet tom probably changes myrtle s memories as well but here we get to a tricky situation myrtle is a ghost i think even for tom it was difficult to change her memory but we know ghosts can be harmed as well sir nicolas was frozen by the look of the basilisk so why not be put under a spell but he may have failed to change her memory completely he is prefect of slytherin that time so even if he speaks parsel can she regognize his voice but maybe he was lucky and myrtle really only remembered large yellow eyes and a boy s voice and that probably wasn t enough _______________________________________________________ myrtle s witness maybe it even was the spider s bite that made people disbelief her it may have been assumed that she simply hallucinated from the poison and her memories are false maybe newt will try and take a closer look at the case but he probably won t be able to proof aragog s innocence either tom riddle will have won for the first time _____________________________________________________ so what do you think did tom riddle perfectly cover

:)  In one of my previous theories, I stated that we may get to see Hagrid being expelled from Hogwarts, since it fits into the timeline and Newt had a part in it … yet I wondered how Hagrid was expelled. Because if we look closely at how the case of Myrtle’s murder, there is actually a lot of hints that needed to be covered so Tom Riddle wouldn’t be suspect any longer…  So enjoy :)   _____________________________________________________________________________   **The corpse**  I already said that Newt may be called to the scene/the ministries’ forensic department to examine the corpse as an expert for magical creatures… so, what will he see?  When Myrtle was killed, there were no physical bruises, leave alone a bitemark… so, either her corpse was left the way it was, or Tom Riddle, talented as he was, faked the biting marks.  I do wonder about where he would get fangs from an Acromantula from. We know he had a good relationship with Horace Slughorn that time, so despite that Acromantula poison is very seldom…  But there is a way how all of this fits together.  And that is Tom Riddles magical power, and the ability to change memories.  _______________________________________________   **A perfect murder**  So, Tom Riddle is all alone - the Basilisk just killed a student, he is standing before her corpse. This was unintentional, and he knows what will happen if he is seen. And he has an idea (or was prepared already).   Getting Aragog  How exactly did he know about the Acromantula Hagrid was hiding? I don’t know for sure, but I believe he found out about him and decided not to tell Professor Dibbet, in case he would need him some day.  Yes, I believe Tom Riddle already prepared himself for an occuring murder, since he could call and talk to the Basilisk already and knew what it was capable of. Yet I’m not sure if he really wanted to kill someone back then since Hogwarts was his only home… maybe he already wanted to point the blame towards Aragog and stop the murders once he was killed.   So, what if he quickly leaves after the murder and seals the door briefly? He then goes for the closet the spider is in, puts it under an imperius curse and (we know it’s possible) hides it in his school bag with a room spreading spell?   _________________________________________   **Back at the toilet**  He goes back to the toilet, tells Aragog to bite the corpse, and then … can he make the poison going through her blood system? Because even if, a trained magic forensic will still find that this wasn’t the cause of her death. But we don’t know if one could tell in 1943… certainly spells and magic need to be evolved and developed as well over time.  So, he returns Aragog to the closet and changes his memories so he doesn’t recall the situation. He had to flee soon, and even if he had claimed that he didn’t kill the girl… who would believe a monstrous spider, able to kill humans?  Returning to the toilet, Tom probably changes Myrtle’s memories as well… but here we get to a tricky situation.  Myrtle is a ghost. I think even for Tom, it was difficult to change her memory… but we know Ghosts can be harmed as well (Sir Nicolas was frozen by the look of the Basilisk), so why not be put under a spell?  But he may have failed to change her memory completely. He is prefect of Slytherin that time, so even if he speaks Parsel… can she regognize his voice? But maybe he was lucky … and Myrtle really only remembered large yellow eyes and a boy’s voice … and that probably wasn’t enough.  _______________________________________________________   **Myrtle’s witness**  Maybe it even was the spider’s bite that made people disbelief her. It may have been assumed that she simply hallucinated from the poison and her memories are false.  Maybe Newt will try and take a closer look at the case, but he probably won’t be able to proof Aragog’s innocence either.  Tom Riddle will have won for the first time.  _____________________________________________________   So, what do you think? Did Tom Riddle perfectly cover up his deed?  Thank you very much for reading :)"

McGonagall's presence in CoG doesn't seem like it's part of some bigger plan involving espionage and time-turners. It seems like Jo thought the audience might think it's neat to hear that name and see a young McGonagall and then she didn't go check her previous writing on the matter so now it's muddying up the timelines.  Credence's age is a bit thrown with this movie because it says he was adopted in 1904, but that the shipwreck happened in 1901, meaning Credence was born somewhere around 1901, but that would make him 25 years old in the first Fantastic Beasts movie and that seems unlikely that at 25 he would still be hanging around Mary Lou Barebone and letting her treat him like that. It also means that he is pretty close to Newt's age and yet Jo continually writes in the scripts other characters referring to him as ""kid"".  I don't believe that there is a contemplated reason for everything that Jo writes. I think she just doesn't always remember the things she writes or says previously and then while writing new material isn't very diligent about going back to check."

dumbledore lead newt to new york where grindelwald was already searching for the rogue obscurus  in fbawtft grindelwald as percival mentions to credance that he believes he's searching for a young girl ariana was  when she died we find out in cog that his obsession with this obscurus is related to his desire to take out dumbledore because he can't do it himself  there's obviously a deep emotional wound from dumbledore and grindlewald's falling out i think that grindlewald would want his death to be personal and cruel  in cog dumbledore says i know this an obscurus grows in the absence of love as a dark twin an only friend if credence has a real brother or sister out there who can take its place he might yet be saved so with these facts out on the table not to mention the numerous time/plot line issues that would arise if credence really was a new dumbledore tell me this doesn't make sense credence is actually possessed by ariana's obscurus both dumbledore and grindelwald suspect this and seek to save and use him respectively the end of this series results in the duel between the two that somehow releases/destroys ariana's obscurus dark twin thus closing the circle i know my explanation is not completely bullet proof but it sure as hell seems like something rowling would do thoughts,crime of grindelwald ident theori spoiler the key to credenc s ident

not complet bullet proof but it sure as hell seem like someth rowl would do thought,"Crimes Of Grindelwald Identity Theory **Spoilers** The key to Credence’s identity and his relationship to the Dumbledores is tied to obscurials.  Here's why:  1. Obscurial and Obscurus(es?) have played a major role in the plot of both movies. This is a major theme in the way that horcruxes were in the original series. There was a classic Rowling twist with the Horcruxes when we learned Potter was a Horcrux and had to die in order to defeat Voldemort. It's safe to assume she might implement a similar red herring technique with the Obscurus.  2. The official definition of an **Obscurus** describes it as a ""[dark](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Arts)"" and ""parasitic"" force. This energy could manifest itself as a separate entity that can erupt in violent, destructive fury.[\[1\]](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Obscurus#cite_note-0) 3. In *FBAWTFT* we learn that Newt has successfully separated an Obscurus from the body of a young Sudanese witch. This is also proof that an Obcusrus can be separated from an Obscurial. We also learn that Dumbledore holds Newt in high regard. I think the two are related. 4.  The symptoms of an Obscurial sounds awfully familiar to Ariana's condition described in the Deathly Hallows.  5. We learn in *COG* that Dumbledore lead Newt to New York - where Grindelwald was already searching for the rogue Obscurus.  6. In *FBAWTFT* Grindelwald (as Percival) mentions to Credance that he believes he's searching for a young girl. Ariana was 14 when she died. We find out in *COG* that his obsession with this Obscurus is related to his desire to take out Dumbledore because he can't do it himself.  7. There's obviously a deep emotional wound from Dumbledore and Grindlewald's falling out. I think that Grindlewald would want his death to be personal and cruel.  8. In *COG,* Dumbledore says, “I know this: an Obscurus grows in the absence of love as a dark twin, an only friend. If Credence has a real brother or sister out there who can take its place, he might yet be saved.”  So with these facts out on the table, not to mention the numerous time/plot-line issues that would arise if Credence really was a new Dumbledore, tell me this doesn't make sense.   Credence is actually possessed by Ariana's Obscurus. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald suspect this, and seek to save and use him respectively. The end of this series results in the duel between the two that somehow releases/destroys Ariana's Obscurus (dark twin) thus closing the circle.   I know my explanation is not completely bullet proof, but it sure as hell seems like something Rowling would do. Thoughts?  & #"

My first and most important question, could  Credence be the brother of Dumbledore? Is it canon? I haven’t read the books in some time but I cant remember any references except Ariana and Abeforth On the other hand the Phoenix part makes sense to me so I’m really confused  Secondly, what about Grindewald’s character, ( and I’m not talking about Johnny Depp’s acting,I really like him and I don’t mind him playing Grindewald). In my opinion,especially in the cemetary scene where he is talking about muggles and WW2 , they made him seem like a good leader that just wants to protect wizards, not necessarily killing muggles that mean no harm, and that really contrasts with what I had in my mind ( that he is very similar to Voldemort) And lastly, what about Queenie, is she bad after all,or just confused?  Sorry for the long post, I really would like to read some opinions on these subjects or anything about the movie, Thanks ❤️"

The biggest issue I have is that Credence isn’t even old enough to be the child on the ship. The screenplay of CoG says that the shipwreck occurred in 1901. That would make Credence at least 26 in 1926 when the first movie takes place. Ezra Miller states in an interview that Credence is 18 in 1926, putting his birth year at 1908, 7 years after the shipwreck. Is it possible that Credence isn’t even related to the shipwreck at all? Why would he have Irma Dugard on his adoption papers if he isn’t even old enough to be the child on the shipwreck?

Pottermore was the absolute best website back when it launched. I'm disappointed how different it is now and I hate that it has turned into clickbait articles. It was so fun to explore and wake up to see that new chapters have been added to the books. I even remember when you had to be waitlisted and wait to to sign up. Every day that I came home from school, I would check to see if I got my email yet. They still have quizzes and a few interactive sections but it definitely isn't the same.  I also visit Hogwarts is Here which is a site that you can practically go to the school. There are real classes with assignments and I have been a member there for about five years. It has changed a lot and the newer school years are slower to release but there are full courses up to I believe fifth year. It's great to go onto during your free time or summer break and you learn a lot like a real class if you were to attend Hogwarts. It is getting a revamp throughout this year and should be a little more functional soon."

for this film btw jk rowling in the flesh was amazing definitely got teary eyed she is so beautiful and lovely and okay i was more than teary eyed i sobbed ultimately however fb suffered from the same things i disliked in cc in short it needs a heavy edit many scenes characters lines should have been cut way too long the pov kept changing and wasn't really explained there were many plot points together at once and none of them stood out/were particularly interesting also it was really hard to tell all the white men apart just saying i had to be like oh this white guy is the senator this white guy is the senator's father which i'm not even sure why they had the senator subplot or characters in the first place took up a good half hour of the film for nothing some issues with hp canon though minor compared to cc i e if newt was kicked out of hogwarts why didn't they break his wand actor wise eddie redmayne is what you'd expect he is good but newt scamander honestly isn't super likeable i disliked tina goldstein there was nothing interesting about her we know they get married it says so in the hp series but i can't think of two characters/actors who have less chemistry than

disenchanted but really expecting to like it more than Cursed Child, which I'd rate at a a solid C+ or B- (I saw Cursed Child in London, did not read the screenplay). And while I hate saying this, I found myself unable to clap at the end credits of Fantastic Beasts because . . . I actually really hated it.  (I'm surprised to use the word hated for this film btw.)  JK Rowling in the flesh was amazing, definitely got teary eyed. She is so beautiful and lovely and okay I was more than teary eyed, I sobbed.   Ultimately, however, FB suffered from the same things I disliked in CC—in short, it needs a HEAVY edit. Many scenes, characters, lines should have been cut. Way too long. The POV kept changing and wasn't really explained. There were MANY plot points together at once, and none of them stood out/were particularly interesting. Also, it was really hard to tell all the white men apart. Just saying. I had to be like, ""oh, this white guy is the senator, this white guy is the senator's father."" Which I'm not even sure why they had the senator subplot or characters in the first place . . . took up a good half hour of the film for nothing.  Some issues with HP canon, though minor compared to CC. (i.e.: If Newt was kicked out of Hogwarts, why didn't they break his wand??)  Actor-wise: Eddie Redmayne is what you'd expect. He is good, but Newt Scamander honestly isn't super likeable. I disliked Tina Goldstein. There was nothing interesting about her. We know they get married (it says so in the HP series) but I can't think of two characters/actors who have less chemistry than Newt and Tina. The no-maj, Kowalski, was fine. He had some funny lines but nothing felt OUTSTANDING, and there was some fat shaming for him that is simply not okay in 2016. By far and away Alison Sudol as Queenie was the best. Queenie was the most interesting of the characters and the most that I could actually see in the world. Also enjoyed the president of MACUSA. And the niffler. Everyone LOVED the niffler. I loved the niffler. In fact, had this film just been Queenie and the niffler it would have been my favorite thing.  Ezra Miller's character Credence and his story was fascinating, but there was way too much backstory that wasn't properly shown. (I get what the backstory was, but I feel like an abused child should warrant more emotion than it did. And I didn't understand anything with this adopted sister. I'm sure she'll be back in a subsequent film but it was way too much to deal with that didn't make sense). And then like, as quick as Credence became interesting, it was over with. Odd choice.  Other issues I took with the film: DIVERSITY. You just can't have Harlem in 1920 with all white people. You can't.  JOHNNY DEPP. Why in the world did they cast a man who beat his wife in this?!? Did they not have a better option?  PREDICTABILITY. One of the greatest strengths of the HP series is how everything comes together seamlessly. Unsure if maybe I'm older, or the fact I work in children's publishing, or what, but I correctly guessed on EVERY occasion what would happen.  CGI was Star Wars prequels levels of bad, in that it was okay, but wayyyyy too much. In fact much of this felt very Star Wars prequels to me. She's completely George Lucas'ing herself.   Also, the movie doesn't set itself up for a next one at the end. So I have no idea where they're gonna go with this?? Someone help because I truly want to understand. It's just odd.  Overall: Hard plot to follow, unlikeable characters, generally not interesting. I'd see it, but when you can rent it from Amazon or iTunes for $3."

I had an anxiety attack last night that was retriggered this morning (we moved today, I haven't worked in over a week trying to prepare - I'm self-employed, the summit I'm planning keeps growing, my youngest is at a stage where everything - joy, anger, sadness - results in screaming and I just got tipped over the edge)  BUT I'm very happy right now because while I've suffered from horrible nightmares since I was a teen, I think I've mentioned here before that listening to the Harry Potter audio books before I go to bed drastically soothes them in a way no other solution has. (Luckily my husband is also a big fan) So, a few weeks ago when I saw some of the Pottery Barn bedding and stuff and was lamenting the fact that our boys aren't old enough for Potter yet, my husband said, ""Why not just get it for us?""   And I did!  I've been hyperventilating on and off all day, was wearing two sweatshirts earlier today even though it was 70 degrees outside because anxiety attacks make me freezing cold and shake, and I walked into our bedroom tonight and instantly felt a little better.  I used to feel weird about seeming like a weird adult still in love with a children's series, but those books meant so much to me in my youth when I was first suffering from depression and anxiety -- along with a lot of crap at home -- and I just love that something little like this can bring me a sense of calm ♥️  I'll post pictures once we add a Hogwarts map print and a few other small decorations 😊"

Before the events of OotP, we have reason to believe that the only people in Hogwarts who truly knew how to work the Room of Requirement were the house elves. Not even Dumbledore seems to know how to use the room, though it's likely he could have figured it out if he'd cared to. Once Dobby tells Harry that the RoR would make a great place to train the DA, the secret is spread to a couple dozen students. Eventually, Malfoy (presumably via Voldemort) learns how to work the room, and by Deathly Hallows, the room is being used as a safehouse/passageway to Hogsmeade, by students who will return the following year.   So, over the course of 3 years, the room appears to be a relative secret for the castle to something that a large portion of the student body and faculty will have used. The secret of the room will have been out, and once a secret like that gets out, I think it sticks with people. Kids will tell their little siblings and friends and the key to solving the room will live on.  There are theories that Crabbe's Fiendfyre spell destroyed the room's functionality, but I don't believe this is confirmed.  If the room does survive though, it's likely that its use will become prohibited, since it presumably could be used for all kinds of nefarious purposes, and locks out people who are not there for that specific purpose. Use of the room would be suspicious."

I hope this is an appropriate subreddit for this question, but I am new here - brought by a biting curiosity for the answer. I’ve always had a soft spot for Filch, probably helped along by his portrayal in the movies. David Bradley did a fantastic job. But it seems to me that Filch, a minor but very much present character throughout the series, is almost entirely insignificant. Besides catching Harry in the halls after hours and being Umbridge’s crony, his whole character seems irrelevant.   And yet, he’s not in the same league as very minor characters like - I don’t know - Professor Flitwick. Filch is a character everyone knows, but it seems he does next to nothing meaningful in the whole series. Why is he there? One would expect that JK would’ve woven him into some integral action that shaped the story, like so many other minor characters, but I can’t find that moment. Is there one, or is Filch totally inconsequential? Is he there to teach us what a Squib is? Provide comic relief? Maybe his purpose is just to be another antagonistic character to Harry, posing minor inconveniences throughout the series, but that’s kind of lame.   I just feel like there is or should be something there that makes Filch more significant.  Any thoughts?"

I had this conversation earlier and am curious what people think. In my own beliefs, it’s   1) Kreacher, which is an exceptional example of a B character with his own perfect little arc that not only stays true to the themes of the story throughout, but is also entertaining to read. Also his ending, literally leading the house elves in the battle of hogwarts, is truly satisfying.  2) Horace Slughorn. As much as I love the earlier books in their own way, it does occasionally fall back on some pretty blunt “good vs evil” characterization, and it was refreshing and interesting to see a character that wasn’t truly good, but most certainly wasn’t evil. He had a distinct personality that whether you liked him or hated him was still engrossing, and was very much something we hadn’t seen before in the series.  Quite curious to see what everyone else thinks deserves more credit.  (Oh almost forgot Fleur; I think she’s a far more interesting character then people give her credit for)"

That seems pretty clear to me that Pettigrew is the one who actually killed him. If that’s the case, why did Cedric appear out of Voldemort’s wand in Priori, and why is such significance placed on the notion that Voldemort himself cast the killing curse that murdered Diggory? Am I missing something?"

2792,poa why wasn t there more of an uproar over fudge sending dementors to hogwarts to catch sirius black seriously one prisoner escapes from azkaban supposedly to kill a student  and rather than sending aurors the people trained to fight and capture dark wizards to safeguard hogwarts fudge decides it would be a better idea to assign a horde of immoral soul sucking emotion draining demons to safeguard britain s only magical school what the hell made fudge even consider this in the first place is the auror department really so lackluster that the dementors were the better option sirius black had already escaped azkaban and shown himself to be immune to the dementors despair inducing effects so using dementors to subdue him would be pointless and he could use he patronus charm to repel them the aurors though had managed to subdue him when he was allegedly caught committing his mass murderer so why not send the aurors again to catch him at least with the aurors you don t have to worry abt them trying to eat the populace why wasn t there even more of an uproar from concerned parents to remove the soul sucking monstrosities away from their children apart from dumbledore

be protect nearli get kill twice pass out to near death on the train in the  attack and fall off hi broom in the  attack and it wa onli through luck that he didn t die,"PoA: Why wasn’t there more of an uproar over Fudge sending Dementors to Hogwarts to catch Sirius Black? Seriously, one prisoner escapes from Azkaban supposedly to kill a student (Harry) and rather than sending Aurors (the people trained to fight and capture Dark wizards) to safeguard Hogwarts  Fudge decides it would be a better idea to assign a horde of immoral, soul sucking emotion draining demons to safeguard Britain’s only magical school. What the hell made Fudge even consider this in the first place? Is the Auror department really so lackluster that the Dementors were the better option?  Sirius Black had already escaped Azkaban and shown himself to be immune to the Dementors’ despair inducing effects so using Dementors to subdue him would be pointless and he could use he Patronus Charm to repel them. The Aurors though had managed to subdue him when he was allegedly caught committing his mass murderer so why not send the Aurors again to catch him. At least with the Aurors you don’t have to worry abt them trying to eat the populace.  Why wasn’t there even more of  an uproar from concerned parents to remove the soul sucking monstrosities away from their children? Apart from Dumbledore forbidding Dementors into the school and Rosmerta the barmaid from the Three Broomsticks complaining abt the Dementors driving away customers, we never heard about anyone, officials, citizens or the newspaper condemning the Ministry for this action. To compare the threat level b/t Sirius and the Dementors. Sirius Black whole powerful is just one man, who has been fought and captured before. The Dementors are unkillable wraiths who cannot be driven off unless you’re capable of casting a Patronus Charm which is noted to be complex enough that even expert wizards have trouble accomplishing it, not to mention they can and will suck out you’re soul essentially rendering you a vegetable and preventing you from passing onto the afterlife.   You’d think sensationalists like Rita Skeeter would use this to paint the Ministry as incompetent mainly mentioned the attacks on the Hogwarts Express and the Quidditch match and how countless students were left traumatized by the Dementor’s soul draining. As well as writing about how Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived, the person the Ministry was supposed to be protected nearly getting killed twice, passing out to near death on the train in the 1st attack and falling off his broom in the 2nd attack and it was only through luck that he didn’t die"

3877,the right kind of rebel theory part  hi there in the next movie as i said before newt may be tested if he is willing to object all orders for the true greater good and i m pretty convinced that tina will face a similar journey warning a lot of discussing circus arcanus in the middle enjoy whether or not i m right about that she travels to paris with queenie to find credence there s no doubt that once she knows he s in the city she ll stop at nothing to contact him though he may mistrust her due to the past events there is no way she will give up on him or obey any law once he s under her protection but this will not be the only obstacle _______________________________________________________ circus arcanus we know she starts working with yusuf kama while in paris and they visit circus arcanus together which will have an impact on her we know tina s relation to humans how will she react to whatever his happening to the freaks in the show we ve seen her face briefly during the first look a disturbed expression in the middle of a pretty loud audience kama seemed a little stunned as well when getting a view whatever the circus presents it doesn t apply well to some people i do wonder what they see actual freak shows sadly often featured staff purposely injuring the presented humans for entertainment but how does that work with the people in this circus maledictus is advertised as enchanting snake girl suggesting that she is going to dance rather than get hurt the advertised oni could suffer for this kind of show and we know about a character named melusine now who could be a sort of waterfairy/shape shifting mermaid who is presented to the audience and forced to swim around in a tank/do tricks maybe shortly lifted out of the water magically for the audience to get a better view which likely is not going to react enchanted to all that is shown i still wonder how credence fits into all of this he is likely more informed about his condition now and has survived an attack by several aurors though not necessarily without a single scratch how can he be controlled what is his part in the show they can t show his face while performing since his survival may be passed on to the macusa so may perform invisibly lifting the performers up and showing them around while staying in the show for alike reasons i m pretty convinced most of the freaks left or were given to the circus by their families and suffer from a magical condition that makes it impossible for them to lead a normal life which may be something they tell tina when she tries to talk to them about their life also they most likely have formed close relationships with each other over time though credence would have a chance if he got a wand and was allowed to practise/lower his magic i m sure he cannot leave the circus just like that either partly because for having nowhere to go as well and partly for not wanting to leave maledictus behind i kind of have the feeling that skender knows neither him nor the the others are going to leave on their own accord and abuses this fact though he cannot mistreat him too badly out of fear of another obscurial outbreak my point is considering that the people at the circus could have legit reasons to stay he wouldn t have to break the law and put an imperius curse on them though what is happening in this circus is i m convinced anything but human and tina is going to remember it in the end i don t think she will end the circus entirely but skender s rule over it she may fight him alongside creed and maledictus or maybe all alone and hand him over to authorities maybe he has some secrets that lead to a prison sentence of a few years before leaving the circus remaining staff after the leaked attack scene with carrying on with the show the way they feel comfortable and staying together but we may see another situation with other horrors tina has to face _______________________________________________________________________________________ the brothel in the list linked on the leaky cauldron about future scenes a scenerie involving prostitutes was mentioned which brings me back to the possibility of an imperius curse being used to keep people in check unfortunately it is very possible that some wizards use this curse to force magic and non magic people into prostitution and as we know barty crouch was subdued to this curse and noone was able to tell whyever the go to a brothel possibly run by such a wizard tina may react in a similar way as to the freak show though this time this may actually end in her freeing all the captives i still have to wrap my mind around what role the brothel could play in this story but it could be used to show another step in tina s journey maybe one in which she actively fight an oppressor once again so all in all tina may get the chance to stand up for others once again i m not sure if she will break the law/statute of secrecy again but if she does maybe she ll stop minding the macusa may decide that her spirit can be of great use in the upcoming war and if they do fire her maybe the british

kind of rebel (Theory, part 2) Hi there :)  In the next movie, as I said before, Newt may be tested if he is willing to object all orders for the (true) greater good… and I’m pretty convinced that Tina will face a similar journey … (warning: a lot of discussing Circus Arcanus in the middle)…  enjoy 😊  Whether or not I’m right about that she travels to Paris with Queenie to find Credence, there’s no doubt that once she knows he’s in the city, she’ll stop at nothing to contact him. Though he may mistrust her due to the past events, there is no way she will give up on him, or obey any law once he’s under her protection.   But this will not be the only obstacle…  _______________________________________________________-   **Circus Arcanus**  We know she starts working with Yusuf Kama while in Paris, and they visit Circus Arcanus together – which will have an impact on her. We know Tina’s relation to humans … how will she react to whatever his happening to the freaks in the show?  We’ve seen her face briefly during the first look – a disturbed expression in the middle of a pretty loud audience.  Kama seemed a little stunned as well when getting a view … whatever the circus presents, it doesn’t apply well to some people.  I do wonder what they see… actual freak shows, sadly, often featured staff purposely injuring the presented humans for entertainment … but how does that work with the people in this circus? Maledictus is advertised as “enchanting snake-girl”, suggesting that she is going to dance rather than get hurt… the advertised “Oni” could suffer for this kind of show… and we know about a character named “Melusine” now, who could be a sort of waterfairy/shape-shifting mermaid, who is presented to the audience and forced to swim around in a tank/do tricks… maybe shortly lifted out of the water magically for the audience to get a better view… which likely is not going to react enchanted to all that is shown.  I still wonder how Credence fits into all of this … he is likely more informed about his condition now, and has survived an attack by several aurors (though not necessarily) without a single scratch. How can he be controlled? What is his part in the show?  They can’t show his face while performing, since his survival may be passed on to the MACUSA, so may perform invisibly, lifting the performers up and showing them around. While staying in the show for alike reasons.  I’m pretty convinced most of the freaks left or were given to the circus by their families, and suffer from a magical condition that makes it impossible for them to lead a normal life, which may be something they tell Tina when she tries to talk to them about their life. Also, they most likely have formed close relationships with each other over time.  Though Credence would have a chance if he got a wand and was allowed to practise/lower his magic, I’m sure he cannot leave the circus just like that either, partly because for having nowhere to go as well and partly for not wanting to leave Maledictus behind.    I kind of have the feeling that Skender knows neither him nor the the others are going to leave on their own accord, and abuses this fact – though he cannot mistreat him too badly out of fear of another obscurial outbreak… my point is, considering that the people at the circus could have legit reasons to stay, he wouldn’t have to break the law and put an imperius curse on them.  Though what is happening in this circus is, I’m convinced, anything but human and Tina is going to remember it. In the end, I don’t think she will end the circus entirely – but Skender’s rule over it.  She may fight him alongside Creed and Maledictus, or maybe all alone 😊 and hand him over to authorities (maybe he has some secrets that lead to a prison sentence of a few years) before leaving the circus’ remaining staff (after the leaked attack scene) with carrying on with the show the way they feel comfortable – and staying together.  But we may see another situation with other horrors Tina has to face.  _______________________________________________________________________________________   **The Brothel**  In the list linked on “The Leaky Cauldron” about future scenes, a scenerie involving prostitutes was mentioned – which brings me back to the possibility of an imperius curse being used to keep people in check.  Unfortunately, it is very possible that some wizards use this curse to force magic and non-magic people into prostitution … and as we know, Barty Crouch was subdued to this curse and noone was able to tell.  Whyever the go to a brothel possibly run by such a wizard, Tina may react in a similar way as to the freak show – though this time this may actually end in her freeing all the captives.  I still have to wrap my mind around what role the brothel could play in this story – but it could be used to show another step in Tina’s journey, maybe one in which she actively fight an oppressor once again.  So, all in all, Tina may get the chance to stand up for others once again. I’m not sure if she will break the law/statute of secrecy again, but if she does… maybe she’ll stop minding.  The MACUSA may decide that her spirit can be of great use in the upcoming war. And if they do fire her … maybe the british ministry will :)  _______________________________________________________________   Anyway, that’s all for now :) Please let me know if you have something to add :)  Thank you very much for reading :)"

For wizards to have the custom of shooting wherever they are and then just vanishing it all, magic must predate intelligence. Things like digging a hole outside of camp and shitting in that were not unknown to pre plumbing muggles. So wizards and muggles must have parted ways before any real form of intelligence evolved.   However, the fact that they can interbreed proves that they are the same species. So they aren't two separate lineages that evolved convergently. Thus I theorize that wizards were the descendants of magical apes, while muggles are actually all squibs that reproduced together, spreading the non-magic mutation until it was more common than magic."

3087,theory of how dumbledore defeats grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that grindelwald has the elder wand so that everyone understand first off we must remember that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to change allegiance grindelwald stunned gregoravich while he had the wand either the stunning spell made the allegiance change or the stealing did both show that the original owner doesn't need to be in possession of it this is also true of  forcing draco's wand off him the elder wand being in dumbledores tomb at the time which was in allegiance of draco at that point which then changes allegiance to  what i believe is that newt is now the true owner after defeating grindelwald in the subway with his pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below with a sense that he s been holding this one back he slashes it through the air out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around graves like a whip graves tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers struggles and falls to his knees dropping his wand this would be a clear act of defeating grindelwald bound and disarmed regardless if grindelwald dropped it of his own accord if he did then it's a sign of giving up and defeat more so then it being disarmed from him grindelwald will be able to use the wand as normal when he receives it back but it will not act like an unbeatable wand for him with the knowledge of the last movie having the blood pact and the theory that they cannot harm eachother which leads to the theory of arianas death being a spell rebounding off one of them then hitting her instead due to the blood pact not letting them harm eachother this is from another theory of how the blood pact works by not allowing them to hit eachother with spells which ties in with how a spell would of ricocheted and hit ariana instead the same may happen again dumbledore may send a disarming spell and it rebounds off grindelwald and hits newt without meaning to which would then cause dumbledore to be the true owner then recognising that it's now attacking his master causes the next spell that grindelwald casts to rebound back at grindelwald which does not go against the conditions of the bloodpact which then defeats him possibly a disarming spell since grindelwald doesn't die which then causes the wand to fly up and dumbledore then takes possession of and ultimately defeats grindelwald,theori of how dumbledor defeat grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that grindelwald ha the elder wand so that everyon understand first off we must rememb that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to chang allegi grindelwald stun gregoravich while he had the wand either the stun spell made the allegi chang or the steal did both show that the origin owner doesn't need to be in possess of it thi is also true of  forc draco' wand off him the elder wand be in dumbledor tomb at the time which wa in allegi of draco at that point which then chang allegi to  what i believ is that newt is now the true owner after defeat grindelwald in the subway with hi pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below with a sens that he s been hold thi one back he slash it through the air out fli a crackl rope of supernatur light that wrap itself around grave like a whip grave tri

he did then it' a sign of give up and defeat more so then it be disarm from him grindelwald will be abl to use the wand as normal when he receiv it back but it will not act like an unbeat wand for him

recognis that it' now attack hi master caus the next spell that grindelwald cast to rebound back at grindelwald which doe not go against the condit of the bloodpact which then defeat him possibl a

grindelwald,"Theory of how Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald even though the blood pact is in play and that Grindelwald has the elder wand. So that everyone understand first off we must remember that the elder wand doesn't need to be held or near the owner to change allegiance, Grindelwald stunned Gregoravich while he had the wand. Either the stunning spell made the allegiance change or the stealing did, both show that the original owner doesn't need to be in possession of it.  This is also true of Harry forcing Draco's wand off him, the elder wand being in Dumbledores tomb at the time which was in allegiance of Draco at that point, which then changes allegiance to Harry.  What I believe is that Newt is now the true owner after defeating grindelwald in the subway with his pet and the use of a spell as written in the screenplay below:  ""With a sense that he’s been holding this one back, he slashes it through the air: out flies a crackling rope of supernatural light that wraps itself around GRAVES like a whip. GRAVES tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers, struggles and falls to his knees, dropping his wand.""  This would be a clear act of defeating Grindelwald, bound and disarmed, regardless if Grindelwald dropped it of his own accord, if he did then it's a sign of giving up and defeat more so then it being ""disarmed"" from him.  Grindelwald will be able to use the wand as normal when he receives it back but it will not act like an unbeatable wand for him.   With the knowledge of the last movie having the blood pact and the theory that they cannot harm eachother which leads to the theory of Arianas death being a spell rebounding off one of them then hitting her instead due to the blood pact not letting them harm eachother (this is from another theory of how the blood pact works by not allowing them to hit eachother with spells which ties in with how a spell would of ricocheted and hit ariana instead), the same may happen again.   Dumbledore may send a disarming spell and it rebounds off Grindelwald and hits Newt without meaning to which would then cause Dumbledore to be the true owner, then recognising that it's now attacking his master, causes the next spell that Grindelwald casts to rebound back at Grindelwald which does not go against the conditions of the bloodpact, which then defeats him, possibly a disarming spell since Grindelwald doesn't die which then causes the wand to fly up and Dumbledore then takes possession of and ultimately defeats Grindelwald."

That doesn't make any sense to me. One of the first things McGonagall says at the start of SS is that people have been living in fear for 11 years. Voldemort being as superstitious as he is wouldn't be at the height of his power for 11 years without having all his horcruxes. In 81, he had himself, the Ring, Diary, Locket, Cup, and Diadem. Nagini wasn't recruited until about the time of his return, so that's 6. Add a mystery horcrux I call H7, that makes 7 pieces in total. If we look at both the book text and the movies, the weakened Voldy looks very similar in both the graveyard in GF and in not-kings-cross station at the end of DH. I think it's pretty evident that the Voldy we see in the graveyard in GF was somehow extracted from the horcrux H7. With H7 essentially destroyed, we're back to 6 pieces (as far as Voldemort knows). And what does Voldemort do as soon as he has enough strength? Horcruxify Nagini to again total 7 pieces. Maybe H7 was actually some artifact of Gryffindor to complete the set, but it was the easiest to access, especially for Wormtail, a former Gryffindor. I just started working on this one, but I think it's pretty airtight. Please lemme know what y'all think! If it causes any plot inconsistencies, etc."

You would think the situation would have arisen countless times before Harry existed, that a mother sacrificed herself to the Killing curse for her child, likely even to Voldemort. I did consider that maybe Voldemort's soul was so unstable by that point that it affected the curse, but I dunno, seems like it would have still happened before Harry. Thoughts/theories?"

3509,grindelwald is lying spoiler this is all about the crimes of grindelwald so spoilers below at the end of the movie when grindelwald gives his big reveal about credence's identity as a dumbledore spoiler i think grindelwald is intentionally lying this is such a huge thing to add to the canon for no real good reason so i think grindelwald made it up to manipulate credence spoiler and rowling wrote it to psyche us out here's my reasoning  grindelwald was there when ariana died and knows how that affected albus  i still think that grindelwald is interested in obscuriouses and the potential of credence being the oldest and most powerful one ever this whole movie was about manipulating credence and getting him to think that grindelwald has information no one else does which we also saw him do in the first one as graves this lie gets credence on his side and if he can give credence a name and reason for his power that he doesn't hate himself for he will value himself and that relationship and now grindelwald has a legit magical cannon at his disposal  this is going to mess with albus so hard if grindelwald can throw an unknown brother into the battle that also brings up the old feeling about ariana that we already saw when dumbledore was talking to leta albus is going to falter without a doubt spoiler  dumbledore is already known as a great wizard so this lie will validate credence and give him something to hang onto tightly this knowledge of his power and great lineage when everyone else is fighting to take it away from him grindelwald will be the only one he can trust spoiler  until of course it is revealed that grindelwald has been lying this will break credence's trust and revert him and probably queenie back to tina and newts side spoiler and setting the stage for the final battle of dumbledore v grindelwald grindelwald lying here makes sense for the characters and the plot it sets the stage for dumbledore to open up about ariana to newt and

what you think,"Grindelwald is lying *spoiler* *this is all about The Crimes of Grindelwald, so spoilers below*   At the end of the movie, when Grindelwald gives his big reveal [about Credence's identity as a Dumbledore](#spoiler), I think Grindelwald is intentionally lying. This is such a huge thing to add to the canon for no real good reason, so I think Grindelwald made it up to manipulate [Credence](#spoiler) and Rowling wrote it to psyche us out.   Here's my reasoning:  1) Grindelwald was there when Ariana died and knows how that affected Albus.  2. I still think that Grindelwald is interested in obscuriouses, and the potential of Credence being the oldest and most powerful one ever.  This whole movie was about manipulating Credence and getting him to think that Grindelwald has information no one else does, which we also saw him do in the first one as Graves. This lie gets Credence on his side, and if he can give Credence a name and reason for his power that he doesn't hate himself for, he will value himself and that relationship. And now Grindelwald has a legit magical cannon at his disposal.  3) This is going to mess with Albus so hard. If [Grindelwald can throw an unknown brother into the battle that also brings up the old feeling about Ariana that we already saw when Dumbledore was talking to Leta, Albus is going to falter, without a doubt.](#spoiler)  4) Dumbledore is already known as a great wizard, so this lie will validate [Credence and give him something to hang onto tightly, this knowledge of his power and great lineage, when everyone else is fighting to take it away from him. Grindelwald will be the only one he can trust.](#Spoiler) 5) Until, of course, it is revealed that Grindelwald has been lying. This will break [Credence's trust and revert him (and probably Queenie) back to Tina and Newts side](#spoiler) and setting the stage for the final battle of Dumbledore v Grindelwald.   Grindelwald lying here makes sense for the characters and the plot; it sets the stage for Dumbledore to open up about Ariana to Newt and strengthen the desire to defeat Grindelwald on a personal level and gets people talking about the movie for a little while. Hopefully this turns out to be true. Let me know what you think."
